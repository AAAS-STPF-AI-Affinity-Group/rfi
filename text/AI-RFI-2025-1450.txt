General Comment
Do not m ove forward with this plan. It'll gut entire creative industries for short term  and shortsighted gain. Current laws m ust stay in place.
Even China has kept their AI program s in check and continues to grow. Unfettered and illegal access only seeks to take away m ore than
it gives. You can only dim inish your bottom  line so m uch before the whole function collapses.
