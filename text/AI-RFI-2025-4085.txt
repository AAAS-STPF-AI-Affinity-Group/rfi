General Comment
AI in its current form  needs to be reconsidered from  the bottom  up. The m ain uses in day to day life have been a wasteful use of
environm ental resources, have added extra steps of once sim ple processes, and have been an outright stain on all creative endeavors. It
not only enables theft but also produces continuously lackluster im ages, writing, and code that have taken jobs from  hard working people
in all artistic fields. It would be one thing if AI stream lined things hum ans can't do well, but the im plem entation of the technology is largely
used to do things m achines can't do well to replace real hum ans can and would do it better.
