General Comment
Do not let OpenAI use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI, it is theft! AI should not be perm itted to have a place in what's being called
"national security", in fact - entertaining such a thought dem onstrates a lack of interest or care in the rights of the average Am erican. It
steals jobs, it steals m aterial, and it consum es too m uch energy to be sustainable long-term . The governm ent allowing AI to control very
sensitive sectors would be an invitation to untold disaster, so if anything, AI should be outlawed and OpenAI should be shut down or
banned from  Governm ent affairs. Again, it steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off theft. Supporting this would be an attack
on the constitutional rights of all Am ericans.
Leaving hum an lives & livelihoods in the hands of AI WILL m ake things worse, and WILL harm  chances of re-election, as well as
endanger the livelihood of countless US citizens. People over Profit.
