General Comment
The “unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents” m entioned here are Am ericans’ rights to privacy, and the copyright of thousands of
Am erican businesses who will be negatively im pacted by allowing OpenAI and other businesses to take their work without discussion or
recom pense. If the President truly wishes to “ensure AI dom inance,” he can follow the exam ple of our greatest historical leaders and
nationalize AI research. Giving carter blanche to for-profit AI com panies is rank corruption with no place in the U.S.
