General Comment
AI should not be im m une from  any lawsuit and SHOULD NOT be able to use copyrighted, or personal artwork, creations that are not
properly com pensated. 
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US above a research and scientific processes 
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
AI should be used as for research purposes, learning the cosm os, training for cancer research and treatm ent, those things. 
AI will only bankrupt Am erican Citizens and corporations building false inform ation.
