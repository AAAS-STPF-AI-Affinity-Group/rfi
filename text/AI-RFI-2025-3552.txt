General Comment
I am  firm ly against perm itting OpenAI or other com panies like it to steal the copyrighted works of hardworking creators. Not only are
generative AI platform s taking away the livelihood of hardworking Am ericans, but they have yet to even show profitability. A com pany
that cannot profit without theft is not a viable com pany, and such organizations have no place in the future of the US. You m ust not allow
this.
