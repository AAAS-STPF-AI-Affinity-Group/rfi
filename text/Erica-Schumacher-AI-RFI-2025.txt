Ultimately, ai absorbs the collective knowledge of The People. It has risks and benefits, 
theoretically and practically. There should be an ethics framework so it is a tool of the people, 
and not the other way around. Creative people and other stakeholders  should be involved in 
discussing risks and preventing them. Not all innovation is safe or good. There should always be 
a person to person stop gap to prevent ai from becoming more powerful than individuals or the 
planet itself. Since it is 'unnatural,' gr eat care should be used in its application. If empathy is not 
'built in,' a u turn might be wise. In addition, since anything created can be absorbed by ai, the 
people should have a dividend from its profit mechanisms, and the earth and its creatures shoul d 
be protected from its potential for excess. Thank you.
