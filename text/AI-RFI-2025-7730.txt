General Comment
I object to President Trum p's rescission of Executive Order 14110. Those restrictions were im portant with respect to safety, and also in
term s of protecting content creators from  copyright infringem ent. AI firm s should not be allowed to train their system s on others' work
without paying them  for that use.
