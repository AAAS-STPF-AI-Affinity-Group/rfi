General Comment
I am  a classical com poser who frequently sets existing poetry and other text to m usic, and as such I've had to becom e fam iliar with the
intricacies of copyright law. Fair use as a doctrine is interpreted very narrowly for artists. As an exam ple, I recently paid $350 for the
rights to set three Em ily Dickinson poem s to m usic. Dickinson is long dead, and m y works do not steal m oney from  her pockets. I also
cannot im agine a circum stance where som eone looking to read her poetry would purchase sheet m usic from  m e, a relatively unknown
com poser, in lieu of purchasing a book from  the publisher who owns the rights. However, not seeking perm ission for this poetry would
have put m e in direct violation of U.S. copyright law.
AI owned by large corporations has taken the works of Dickinson, and huge num bers of other authors and artists (m any alive and
dependent on art for their incom e), with no perm ission or pay, and uploaded copies of them  to its databases as training m aterial. Its direct,
stated goal is to use the copyrighted works of others as the m aterial to create m ore works that will directly com pete with those in its
training m aterials. The m akers of AI want to use living creatives' artworks to m ake their jobs and creations obsolete. How is this a fair use
of the m aterial? How does it not actively, intentionally, and m aliciously infringe on copyright? Why should there be one rule for living
artists, and another for corporations and m achines?
