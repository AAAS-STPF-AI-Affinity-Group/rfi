General Comment
I do not think AI has a future in our country nor do I want to see artists having their hard earned work, tim e, efforts, and skill trained on
and spat out by m achines. I want to view and read works created by hum an hands as god intended. A m achine will never replicate the
depth of hum an em otions and experiences, and I am  tired of cheap im itations flooding flooding the Am erican people's choices. AI has no
future, reject this plan at once.
