Recently, from an executive order by Donald Trump, a request was made in seeking an AI
Action Plan to try and "define the priority policy actions needed to sustain and enhanceAmerica's AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do nothamper private sector AI innovation."
This premise is extremely faulty, short sighted, and ultimately more damaging for science as
well as hampering legal copyright & personal expression as a whole.
Generative media tools built off copyright abuse and stealing (often labeled as "AI" in current
trends) is not the future of technology. More so, pursuing what is ultimately a divisive,abusive, and severely infringing method for breaking all forms of copyright would do nothingbut sour our technological progress and halt us back, while the rest of the world will see fit topursue technology that is not reliant on random generation methods that are impossible for thehuman brain to grasp, let alone fix or improve. It is the equivalent of allowing dangerousbiological experiments on humans, but instead it is the very core tenets of art and all creativedrives; the human mind behind them.
Therefore, as a formal comment and complaint, I recommend this plan to discuss the risks and
dangers of AI, and how companies, governments, and organizations should receive limitationsin the use of generative tools so as to preserve the absolute integrity of copyright, ownership,and property rights to one's own art creations.
