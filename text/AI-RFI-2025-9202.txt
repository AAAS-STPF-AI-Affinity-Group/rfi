General Comment
If Large Language Model AI com panies can't survive without being allowed to steal their training data without com pensating creators,
then they should fail. Free m arket capitalism ! I don't support these AI com panies seeking welfare handouts by changing the laws to avoid
paying proper dues. No com m unist or socialist redistribution of property just to fuel m ediocre autocorrect algorithm s that provide dubious
value if not outright inaccurate hallucinated results.
