Page 2 of 6 VI. Application and Use:
•Sector -Specific Guidelines:  Develop tailored guidelines for AI use in healthcare,
finance, defense, and education.
•Government Adoption:  Modernize federal agencies with AI capabilities, prioritizing
systems that enhance public service.
VII. Explainability and Assurance:
•Transparency Standards:  Require AI systems to provide human -readable explanations
for critical decisions. Develop guidelines for standardized reporting that outlines model
decision pathways, key influencing factors, and confidence levels. Encourage the use of
visual and interactive tools to help users understand complex model behavior, especially
in high -impact domains like healthcare, law, and public safety. Foster research into new
techniques that improve i nterpretability without sacrificing model performance.
•Verification Processes:  Establish independent bodies to certify AI system accuracy and
reliability.
VIII. Cybersecurity:
•Robust Defenses:  Mandate regular penetration testing and adversarial resilience for AI
systems.
•Threat Intelligence Sharing:  Foster public -private partnerships for real -time threat data
exchange.
IX. Data Privacy and Security:
•Lifecycle Protections:  Enforce data security practices across AI system lifecycles,
including encryption and access controls.
•AI Model Integrity:  Develop countermeasures against model poisoning and adversarial
attacks.
•Protections for Certain Types of Data:  Ensure protections for data including but not
limited to personal identifiable information, sensitive, medical information, patient
privacy, and confidential information.
X. Risks, Regulation, and Governance:
•Risks:  AI can make mistakes  (hallucinations) , which is why it is important to have a
human -in-the loop to verify and check AI outputs . Businesses can be encouraged to
adhere to a confidence scoring system to filter hallucinations, which will create more
reliable AI systems . The scoring system would also allow end users to know that they are
interacting with a specific AI tool with a certain level of confidence.


Page 3 of 6 •Pornography Legislation:  Enact federal laws to address AI deepfake pornography
including the offenses of possession, distribution,  and manufacturing . Protection  should
apply to  adults and children . Many states have already enacted that child pornography is
illegal even if it is AI generated .
•Limitations of AI Self -Awareness/ Consciousness Regulations – Collaborate with
industry and academia to set evolving safety and performance benchmarks . Ensure that
businesses  put controls in place and create legislation to  define and  put limitations around
AI from becoming  self-aware or conscious . This would put the public’s fears and
skepticism at ease because movies such as the “Terminator ” series and “2001: A Space
Odyssey ” are still very much at the forefront of American pop culture .
•Proportionate Regulation:  Develop a flexible, risk -based regulatory framework that
adapts to technological advances. High -risk applications, like healthcare and defense,
should face stricter oversight, while low -risk, consumer -facing applications should
experience lighter touch reg ulation. This approach encourages innovation while
safeguarding public welfare. Regularly review and update regulations to keep pace with
AI development, minimizing compliance burdens for smaller firms and startups.
•Ethical AI Boards:  Create advisory panels with diverse stakeholders to guide AI
governance . AI should also be addressed in the ethics of professional industries (state bar
professional rules of responsibility, medical boards, etc.)
•Unauthorized Practice of Certain Professions: A major risk of AI for the public is for
them to rely on AI outputs for legal, psychiatric, and medical care among other areas.
Controls should be put in place to prevent this from happening or businesses should
provide prominent disclaimers for consumers  to not rely on the information regarding
these areas.
XI. Technical and Safety Standards:
•Standards Development:  Collaborate with industry and academia to set evolving safety
and performance benchmarks.
•Medical  Industry:
oHuman -in-the-Loop: Doctors should not rely  solely  on AI recommendations
alone but should use AI technologies to assist  them with  patient diagnoses and
treatment (human -in-the-loop verification ).
oStandardizing Information:  Standardize the format of medical information  to
allow for consistency  and inputs for medical AI technologies . Medical records
need to be securely stored electronically  and existing software systems should
have the ability to extract data , which can then be converted into a standard


Page 4 of 6 format  to be fed into AI systems . However, this does not mean that there needs to 
be a national medical software system.  
oMinimize the Impact of AI Medical Technologies: Minimize the impact on
medical offices  by using  AI technologies , so they will not  be frequently having to
adapt  and migrate  to new systems . A current problem is that many medical
software systems are unable to  talk to each other (ex. primary care and specialist
systems) . Going to a new system is expensive  with the cost of purchasing another
software . Moreover, it takes time to train healthcare workers  to learn a nother
system . Instead, encourage research on fin ding ways to extract existing medical
information  from multiple systems and upload it into an AI model that can be
made accessible to  medical professionals in diagnos ing and treat ing patients based
on a current patient’s test results and medical history.
oAffordability and Accessibility: Medical AI systems used for diagnostics and
treatment should be affordable and accessible to the medical community .
“Affordable” is broad and relative term, and businesses should make a profit.
However, a doctor on an American Indian reservation should be able to access AI
technologies the same as a doctor in a large hospital to help them the d iagnosis
and treatment of their patients . Federal, state, and local g overnment entities as
well as  American Indian reservations  should be eligible for AI technology
discounts and trainings  to level the playing field.
XII. National Security and Defense:
•AI for Defense:  Expand AI adoption for threat detection, logistics, and strategic
decision -making.
•Guardrails for Dual -Use Tech:  Regulate AI applications with potential military and
civilian uses.
•National Guard : Expand the role of the National Guard cybersecurity branch to provide
additional support for AI cybersecurity by working with federal, state agencies, and local
government agencies.
XIII. Research and Development:
•R&D Funding:  Increase federal AI research budgets, prioritizing transformative
technologies.
•Innovation Hubs:  Establish AI research centers to bridge academia, industry, and
government.
XIV . Education and Workforce:


Page 5 of 6 •AI Education Pipeline:  Invest in STEM programs, AI -focused curricula, and vocational
training . Incentivize students to major in STEM fields in colleges and universities by
creating a debt forgiveness program . Create grants or provide incentives for states who
encourage and fund STEM curriculum grades K-12 in school systems . Encourage states
to allow high school guidance counselors to play a more active role in evaluating  and
identifying  students who would be  ideal  candidates  to go into STEM fields . Create a
national awareness program to e ncourage women to go into STEM fields .
•Reskilling Initiatives:  Support displaced workers with AI -centric reskilling programs.
XV . Innovation and Competition:
•Competitive Markets:  Prevent monopolistic practices  and consumer price gauging ,
ensuring startups can compete and thrive.
•Venture Capital Support:  Facilitate funding for AI startups through public and private
channels.
XVI. Intellectual Property:
•IP Protections:  Strengthen AI -related patent protections to safeguard American
innovations. Establish clear guidelines for AI -generated inventions, ensuring that
intellectual property laws keep pace with technological advancements. Enhance
enforcement mechanisms to combat  IP theft, particularly from foreign adversaries, by
increasing penalties and investigative resources. Support international cooperation on AI
patents to facilitate fair and reciprocal protections for U.S. businesses operating globally.
•US Patent and Trademark Office Employees:  Hire more patent agents,  specifically
those with computer science educational backgrounds or STEM backgrounds to process
AI patents quicker.
•Fast-Track AI Patents:  Accelerate patent reviews for critical AI technologies  in
hardware, software, or other.
•Pharmaceutical Industry:
oImplement a process  allowing  companies to share AI IP with other companies
akin to  the pharmaceutical industry where proven  and tested  drugs can be made
into generics , so that companies entering the AI market do not have to start from
nothing .
oAI will likely speed up innovation in many areas and especially in the
pharmaceutical industry.  Update the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation
Act (BPCIA) to allow FDA sharing of original biologics manufacturing
information with follow -on biologics  developers.  This will create more
competition for companies enter ing the biologics  market because AI will allow


Page 6 of 6 for faster and newer drug development . Moreover, b y creating more competition 
in this area, there will be  a biologics price reduction.  
XVII. Procurement:
•AI-Ready Procurement:  Modernize federal procurement practices to streamline AI
system adoption.
XVIII. International Collaboration and Export Controls:
•Strategic Alliances:  Build international AI research alliances while safeguarding U.S.
interests.  Specifically, the U.S. should partner with Israel.
•Export Safeguards:  Tighten export controls on sensitive AI technologies to prevent
adversarial misuse. Implement a tiered control system that classifies AI technologies
based on their potential impact on national security. Enhance end -use monitoring and
enforce strict penalt ies for violations. Collaborate with allies to establish common export
standards, ensuring that critical technologies do not fall into the hands of adversaries
while preserving the ability of U.S. companies to compete globally.
XIX. AI Litigation and the Judicial Branch:
•Litigation:  AI related lawsuits  will ensue . However, plaintiffs should be required to show
standing . This will discourage repeat plaintiffs and prevent the systematic targeting of
businesses  with AI technologies . Encourage state and local governments to require
plaintiffs to show standing who have been harmed by AI.
•Judges: Ensure that federal judges receive mandatory CLE training , specifically on AI .
Encourage state and local judges to receive mandatory AI CLE training . Hire and appoint
federal  judges with  STEM backgrounds .
Conclusion:  This action plan aims to solidify America’s leadership in AI, fostering innovation 
while protecting national interests and vulnerable populations. Human oversight remains a 
cornerstone, ensuring AI systems serve the public good without compromising safety  or values. 
By balancing innovation with responsible stewardship, the United States can shape an AI -
powered future that upholds American ideals and global leadership.
