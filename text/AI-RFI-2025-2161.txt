General Comment
Generative AI is a tool. It does not think. It does not create. It cannot recognize bias or com m on sense errors. It cannot adjust for unique
situations or unexpected problem s. It cannot innovate.
It should not be called "intelligence". The day that som eone cracks actual artificial intelligence will be revolutionary. The path that lays
down is not the one we tread now. 
It can be an interesting and fun tool, certainly. It is not going to be as powerful a tool as the people selling it hope.
Let's not bloat & weigh down our software and engineer innovators. Let's not sacrifice other, m ore useful opportunities for advancem ent
by giving heavy governm ent priority to this one tool. 
Buying too heavily into a bubble will screw us all when it bursts.
