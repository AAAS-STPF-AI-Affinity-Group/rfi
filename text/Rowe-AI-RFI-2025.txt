My name is Alex Rowe and I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High 
School. I completed a semester course on AI and Ethics and studied the impacts of Generative AI on American lives and technology. Executive Order 14179 will be a mix of improvement and disruption about the policy of national security and defense because removing regulations on AI can have certain benefits, but also some disadvantages. Americans use AI in 2025 in over half of their daily lives. AI is so prominent that you can find it everywhere, in fast food chains, in massive retail corporations, in c ompanies that are advancing self -driving technology, and there is 
so much more. With this information, people would be able to use AI however they want much more than is already available, and they could make anything they want. This is very good in theory, and can improve creativity and advance what humans can do further, but there is also the fact that not all humans are benevolent with each other. Humans who are at odds with each other can take on AI with more ability than ever before and American lives could be put in danger. How will proper security measures be put in place to make sure unregulated AI doesnâ€™t bring harm to the people and other aspects of our country?
