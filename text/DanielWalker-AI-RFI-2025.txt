To whom it may concern:
I have absolutely no doubt that changing the laws in favor of AI training will result in more
media posting not unlike Trump sucking on Elons feet, you know, the video posted at theHUD? If you don't want more of that garbage I simply suggest keeping laws in place to protectoriginal IP from being used as training data for AI video/images/audio/etc. Lets keep AIresearch to medical and engineering where it actually could do something good. I'm sick ofthis nonsense.
