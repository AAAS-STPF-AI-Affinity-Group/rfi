General Comment
I am  very concerned that this will threaten Am erican citizens livelihoods. I am  worried about generative AI specifically. If training m odels
with copyrighted works becom es fair use com panies who hire graphic designers, writers, illustrators, anim ators and the like will probably
fire them  to use AI slop instead. Those workers will also definitely not be com pensated for their work being used this way. It is basically
theft. I am  certain this will m ake unem ploym ent even worse.
