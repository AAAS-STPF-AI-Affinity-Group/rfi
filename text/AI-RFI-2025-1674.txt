General Comment
Hum anity is defined by our unique thoughts and desires. To distill those into m eaningless data would be detrim ental. 
The US does not need to lose its identity and history to a soulless nothing. 
Protect thought, protect art. 
Lim it ai, m ake them  pay if they want to use works to train.
