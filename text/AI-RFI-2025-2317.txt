General Comment
Modern AI (also known as LLM m achine learning) should not be giving any exclusive concessions (including m onetary and legal) in
Am erica. As the world has already proven, AI does not take a lot of m oney yo develop. Nor fo I think it should be allowed to bypass
copyright law just because the product of m odern AI is essentially a distillation of existing content. Stop giving these powerful tech
com panies unfair advantages and governm ent handouts. Kill this bill.
