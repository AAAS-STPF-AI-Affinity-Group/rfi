General Comment
As a concerned citizen, it's im portant to m e to put basic restrictions and requirem ents on AI so that the United States nor its citizens be
taken advantage of by it in unfair ways: nam ely, financially.
With this in m ind it would be right to restrict AI
1) from  having a social security num ber
2) from  being given personhood status
3) from  being able to directly receive any incom e or com pensation
4) from  being able to be issued an ID from  any state or federal governm ent. These IDs should be reserved for people.
It would also be prudent to include som e requirem ents. AI m ust be accountable in it's actions, decisions, conclusions in certain basic
ways. The issuing entity (com pany or individual(s)) m ust be held accountable for dam ages that will occur. Therefore an AI m ust be
attached to (identified by) the issuer in order for recourse for certain dam ages that individuals or com panies incur. This is to say that the
issuer should be able to be held liable instead of the AI, so that the AI is not given personhood status.
AI does not have a lim bic system . It does not experience anger, resentm ent, revenge, love, em pathy or sym pathy in a real way. Nor can it
procreate. It should not be able to be a hum an being in the eyes of the law. Let's put and keep basic, prudent restrictions and
requirem ents in place.
