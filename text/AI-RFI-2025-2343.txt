General Comment
I am  a creative person working in a creative field. Not only is AI grossly overused, but incredibly oversold in it's usefulness. Not only that,
it is taking away jobs for our people now for work that is in less quality. Please do not let big tech com panies take our ability to share our
work online. Online is the best way sm all businesses can do anything these days. Protect our rights.
