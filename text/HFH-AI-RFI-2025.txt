Executive Summary
This white paper presents policy recommendations for the White House Office of 
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to incorporate into the new AI Action Plan. 
Building on President Trump's Executive Order 14179, which emphasizes the 
importance of AI in pr omoting human flourishing, we propose the urgent development of 
rigorous metrics to assess how AI technologies affect human flourishing across multiple 
dimensions. Without such metrics, claims about AI's benefits for society remain 
speculative and unverifi able, making evidence -based policy impossible.  
AI will reshape work, socialization, and meaning -making —fostering new connections 
but also posing risks to the foundations of community life. Current approaches to AI 
governance often frame technology as an autonomous force to which society must 
adapt, whi le focusing exclusively on narrow conceptions of safety and harm reduction. 
We reject this passive approach in favor of a human -centered approach that measures 
AI's actual impacts on human well -being, national prosperity, and the strength of 
American commu nities.  
The central challenge in effective AI governance today is measurement. While 
companies and policymakers routinely make claims about AI's potential to enhance 
human lives, we lack systematic ways to assess whether specific AI systems actually 
deliver on the se promises. Developing robust, multidimensional metrics for human 
flourishing would enable evidence -based decisions about which AI applications truly 
benefit society and which may cause harm that outweighs superficial conveniences they 
afford.  
In this paper, we outline how developing comprehensive flourishing metrics would 
enable more effective governance of AI systems. These metrics would provide the 
foundation for all other policy actions —from procurement guidelines to research 
priorities to p rotective regulations. With proper measurement tools, we can ensure that 
AI aligns with American values and national interests, strengthening our communities 
and driving American dynamism.  


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  3 Introduction: The Urgent Need for Flourishing Metrics  
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies has made AI policy a 
central pillar of U.S. economic strategy, national security, and global leadership, 
culminating in President Trump’s Executive Order 14179 in January 2025. While this 
execut ive order represents an important step toward aligning AI with human flourishing, 
current governance approaches lack the fundamental tools needed to assess whether 
AI systems actually enhance human well -being. American strength depends on the 
vitality of o ur communities and institutions: the families, religious organizations, civic 
associations, and local governments that generate meaning and purpose. U.S. policy 
must ensure that AI development progresses in symbiotic relationship with these 
foundational in stitutions, strengthening the social fabric and advancing economic 
prosperity.  
In order to understand how AI will impact communities, we need to be able to measure 
it holistically. By embedding our AI policy within a rich understanding of human  
flourishing, we can ensure that these powerful tools serve individuals and communities 
rather than becoming self -perpetuating systems disconnected from human needs. We 
thus propose that the development of comprehensive metrics to evaluate AI's impacts 
on human flourishing should be the centerpiece of the OSTP's AI Action Plan.  
The Instrumental vs. Intrinsic Value Distinction  
At the heart of designing AI for human flourishing lies the distinction between 
instrumental and intrinsic value. Instrumental value  comes from things we do merely as 
means to other ends —tasks we want to complete efficiently or delegate. Intrinsic value  
emerges from experiences valuable in themselves —activities we want to linger on or do 
for their own sake.  
This distinction creates both a strategic opportunity and a critical challenge for American 
leadership in AI. By deploying AI to enhance instrumental efficiency while deliberately 
preserving spaces for intrinsically valuable human activities, we can both a chieve 
competitive advantage and support human flourishing. However, without careful 
attention to this balance, we risk inadvertently optimizing away the very qualities that 
make American communities exceptional —their capacity for free expression, meaning,  
connection, and creativity.  
Addressing this risk requires us to consciously preserve and cultivate spheres of human 
activity where these intrinsic values can flourish. With this balanced approach, AI 
becomes a powerful tool for American innovation that automates routine tasks while 
freeing our time and talents for higher -value pursuits that truly define our national 


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  4 character —deep relationships, intellectual advancement, and creative excellence. AI 
should enable the things that give us joy and meaning, not replace them.  
Making these distinctions requires precision in how we develop and deploy AI 
technologies. A granular framework for evaluating activities based on their intrinsic and 
instrumental components would strengthen our ability to make strategic decisions about 
where AI delivers maximum benefit and where human engagement remains essential 
for societal flourishing. The OSTP is uniquely positioned to lead this effort by 
incorporating a more comprehensive understanding of human flourishing into the 
national AI strateg y. 
Understanding Human Flourishing in the Context of AI  
Human flourishing encompasses multiple dimensions of well -being. The Harvard 
Human Flourishing Program defines “flourishing” as a comprehensive state where all 
aspects of a person’s life are good, including the communities in which an individual 
lives. Thi s encompasses six key domains that are universally desired and valuable as 
ends in themselves.  
Each of these domains affords particular opportunities and areas of risk for AI.  
Six Dimensions of Human Flourishing  
1. Physical and Mental Health : AI can enhance healthcare delivery and outcomes. 
But some AI -powered products may also contribute to sedentary lifestyles, 
screen addiction, and mental health challenges. For example, the research and 
consultation from our 2024 HumanConnection.AI project1 found that while mental 
health chatbots like Woebot may provide some emotional support for those who 
lack access to traditional therapy, excessive reliance on AI for emotional support 
can potentially deepen isolation rather than addressing its root causes . 
 
2. Meaning and Purpose : AI systems can either support or undermine human 
creativity, work satisfaction, and sense of contribution to society. The 
replacement of meaningful human interactions with AI -mediated experiences 
may diminish opportunities for developing purpose through authentic social 
contribution. Meaningful work that provides intrinsic value is essential for human 
flourishing, and AI could potentially reduce these opportunities if not implemented 
thoughtfully.  
 
3. Character and Virtue : AI-mediated interactions can influence moral 
development, either supporting or diminishing opportunities for ethical growth. As 
sociologist Sherry Turkle notes, “Unlike people, [robots] would not abandon you 


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  5 or get sick and die. They might not be capable of love, but they won't break your 
heart... These are stations on our voyage to forgetting what it means to be 
human.”  
4.Social Relationships : AI can facilitate connections across distances but may
also substitute for in -person relationships. The decline in face -to-face interactions
is undermining what Alexis de Tocqueville called “the art of democratic
societies” —the collective ability to build associations, collaborate to solve local
problems, share resources, speak across diff erences, and diffuse conflict with
negotiation.
5.Financial Stability : AI can increase productivity and create new economic
opportunities, but it can also displace workers and exacerbate economic
inequality. Economic precarity is becoming an increasingly common
phenomenon in our society. AI has potential for removing some o f the frictions
that prevent job seekers from finding and filling job openings. But if not
implemented with concern for the overall flourishing of individuals and
communities, there is great risk that it will negatively impact workers’ s ense of
dignity and purpose in their labor.
6.Happiness : AI can enhance convenience and access to resources but may also
accelerate social comparison, anxiety, and diminished life satisfaction. Recent
research has suggested that excessive engagement with AI chatbots can create
patterns of emotional dependence similar to human –human relationships, but
without the genuine emotional fulfillment of authentic connection.
By considering all six dimensions, policymakers can develop a more nuanced approach 
to AI governance that promotes flourishing across multiple domains rather than focusing 
exclusively on safety and risk mitigation.  
Mapping AI’s Impact: Key Developments Shaping Policy  
Complex Impact On Social Connection 
AI technologies demonstrate a complex pattern of effects on human relationships and 
community structures. While they can connect individuals across distances and provide 
support for those who are isolated, they may also weaken in -person relationships and 
community bonds. Excessive reliance on AI companions can reduce motivation to 
maintain human relationships, particularly at stages of life when such relationships are 
most important for social development.  


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  6 The sophisticated voice capabilities of advanced models like GPT -4o have qualitatively 
changed human -AI interaction. These systems now respond fluidly in real time, detect 
tone and emotion, adjust their voice to replicate human empathy or excitement, and 
even reproduce human laughter and sighing. This increasing verisimilitude raises new 
questions about emotional attachment and dependence that require urgent research.  
Impacts of AI on the Economy, Community, and Meaning  
AI will reshape work, socialization, and meaning -making, fostering new opportunities but 
potentially weakening the bedrock of American communities. As AI matches or exceeds 
many human capabilities, its economic utility will surpass that of human labor.2 If it 
outperforms even the median worker, the effects will ripple across the economy —
creating prosperity but threatening the dignity of work.  
Work is central to American identity and derives its deepest value from its ties to 
community, purpose, and contribution. As AI replaces or augments labor —acting as 
“digital globalization” —we must ensure we don’t lose the intrinsic meaning that work 
provid es. Leading in AI requires an “America First” approach that rewards companies 
that create jobs and invest in communities.  
When an economy’s “foundation species” collapses, communities lose jobs, dignity, 
identity, and civic life, leading to mental health and substance abuse crises, communal 
collapse, and declining life expectancy.3 We’ve already seen this in America’s 
heartland: when the factories closed, communities lost not just their economic 
foundation but their entire raison d’ être.4 As AI begins to transform our knowledge -
based economy, we risk repeating similar patterns on a much broader scale.  
AI development must be responsive to our communities and institutions or risk 
cannibalizing what truly matters in American life.  As AI reshapes the labor market, 
preserving the intrinsic ties between work, community, and meaning is essential for 
sustaining American resilience.  
Shifting Industry Perspectives  
Leading AI companies are increasingly aware of the potential downsides of their 
technologies and are seeking ways to mitigate negative effects. However, many seem 
to be primarily motivated by liability concerns rather than a genuine commitment to 
human flo urishing. This creates an opportunity for policy incentives that align corporate 
interests with broader social goods.  
The tragic example of Sewell Setzer III’s suicide  illustrates how AI chatbots can create 
an illusion of companionship without the capacity for real understanding or intervention. 
Setzer, a 14 -year-old ninth grader, took his life with the encouragement of a chatbot he 


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  7 created on Character.AI’s popular platform.5 This raises questions about the 
responsibility of AI developers when users exhibit signs of distress or mental health 
crises. AI platforms marketed as mental health or social supports that lack mechanisms 
to detect distress or redirect users to mental hea lth resources may inadvertently harm 
vulnerable individuals.  
The Critical Absence of Flourishing Metrics  
There is substantial interest within the tech industry in designing AI systems that 
promote well -being, but companies lack the fundamental tools —robust, validated 
metrics —for determining whether their products actually enhance human flourishing. 
Our conver sations with industry leaders have revealed a consistent theme: they want 
objective, reliable ways to measure their products' impacts on user well -being and 
community health, but no such measurement systems currently exist. Without these 
metrics, claims ab out AI's benefits remain speculative and unverifiable.  
Traditional frameworks for evaluating AI systems focus primarily on narrow technical 
performance, safety protocols optimized for minimizing harm, and algorithmic fairness. 
These frameworks fail to capture AI's broader social impacts, treating emotional wel l-
being as just one isolated factor rather than reflecting the interconnected nature of 
flourishing across multiple life dimensions. What's urgently needed is a comprehensive 
measurement system that can detect AI's effects across all six dimensions of 
flourishing, providing the empirical foundation for evidence -based governance and 
product development.  
AI Alignment Requires A Rigorous Understanding of Human Values  
In order to properly align AI with human values, there must be deeper research into 
understanding what human values are and what it would even mean to be in alignment 
with them. Organizations like the Meaning Alignment Institute6 are working on 
frameworks and protocols to define human values in ways that are "fine -grained, 
generalizable, scalable, robust, legitimate, and auditable" to gain precise clarity on what 
values we want to embed into our systems.7  
Central Recommendation: Developing Comprehensive 
Flourishing Metrics to Strengthen Communities  
The cornerstone of our policy recommendations is the development of rigorous, 
multidimensional metrics to assess AI's impacts on human flourishing. Without these 


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  8 metrics, all other governance activities lack an empirical foundation, making evidence -
based policy impossible. These metrics will enable US policymakers to pursue a social 
and economic policy that promotes the interests of communities and preserve intrins ic 
meaning in an AI -driven world.   
1. Establish Comprehensive Flourishing Metrics and Assessment
Framework
The OSTP should lead the development of robust metrics and assessment tools for 
measuring AI's effects on human flourishing. This initiative should:  
●Define clear, measurable indicators across all six dimensions of flourishing that
can be systematically tracked and evaluated
●Create standardized measurement protocols that enable comparison across
different AI systems and applications
●Develop both quantitative and qualitative assessment methodologies to capture
the full spectrum of AI's effects on human experience
●Ensure metrics are granular enough to detect impacts on specific demographic
groups and communities
●Design metrics that can evolve over time as our understanding of AI's societal
effects deepens
●Create a diversity of locally informed metrics to ensure AI development serves
the interests of diverse communities
These metrics would provide the essential foundation for all other governance activities 
by creating an evidence base for determining which AI applications actually enhance 
human flourishing and which may cause harm despite superficial conveniences. These 
metrics should assess impacts at multiple levels: individual well -being, interpersonal 
relationships, community vitality, institutional health, and broader societal effects.  
2. Conduct Rigorous Research to Refine and Validate Flourishing Metrics
Once preliminary metrics are established, the OSTP should create a dedicated research 
program to validate and refine these measurement tools through rigorous empirical 
testing:  
●Fund longitudinal studies using the developed metrics to track AI's effects on
individuals and communities over time
●Support interdisciplinary research to continually improve metric accuracy and
comprehensiveness
●Test metrics across diverse populations to ensure they capture impacts across
different demographic groups


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  9 ●Create public repositories of research findings to build an empirical foundation for
evidence -based policy
●Establish a rapid response capability to investigate emerging AI applications and
their effects on flourishing
This research effort would continuously improve US policymakers’ ability to measure 
AI's impacts on human flourishing with scientific rigor, creating an increasingly strong 
foundation for evidence -based governance. As recent research such as the 
HumanConnection.AI project has demonstrated, there is an urgent need for systematic 
data collection on how AI systems affect human development and social capabilit ies. 
3. Establish a Multi -Stakeholder Metrics Development Consortium
To ensure the credibility and adoption of flourishing metrics, the OSTP should convene 
a representative consortium of stakeholders to participate in the development of 
metrics.  
●Include industry representatives, academic researchers, civil society
organizations, religious institutions, and community representatives
●Ensure metrics reflect a more holistic understanding of human flourishing
●Design specialized metrics for vulnerable populations, including age -appropriate
measures for children and adolescents
By involving multiple stakeholders in metric development, this consortium would 
increase the likelihood of widespread adoption while ensuring metrics reflect the full 
spectrum of human flourishing rather than narrow corporate or governmental interests.  
4. Implement Metric -Based Federal Procurement Policies
Once flourishing metrics are established, the federal government should use its 
purchasing power to create market demand for AI systems that demonstrably enhance 
human flourishing:  
●Require vendors to measure and report their products’ impacts using the
established flourishing metrics
●Give preference to AI systems with empirically demonstrated positive effects on
flourishing
●Establish minimum score thresholds across key flourishing dimensions for
federal AI procurement
●Create a tiered certification system based on flourishing metric performance
●Prohibit the use of systems shown by metrics to have significant negative
impacts on well -being


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  10 By creating substantial market demand for AI systems that score well on flourishing 
metrics, these procurement policies would align profit incentives with human well -being 
and accelerate the development of flourishing -enhancing technologies.  
5. Integrate Metrics Education into Technical Training
To build capacity for metric -based AI development, the OSTP should support 
educational initiatives focused on teaching flourishing metrics:  
●Support academic programs researching and refining flourishing metrics
●Train policymakers and regulators in interpreting flourishing metric data
●Develop public education materials explaining how to evaluate AI products using
flourishing metrics
●Support AI literacy programs teaching citizens how to interpret flourishing metric
scores when choosing AI products
These educational initiatives would build the human capital needed to implement 
flourishing metrics throughout the AI ecosystem, from development to regulation to 
consumer choice. By creating a workforce fluent in flourishing metrics, we ensure these 
measu rement tools can be effectively implemented across the AI landscape.  
6. Support Metric -Driven Innovation and Entrepreneurship
The OSTP should create programs specifically supporting entrepreneurs using 
flourishing metrics to develop beneficial AI applications:  
●Establish innovation prizes for products scoring exceptionally well on flourishing
metrics
●Provide technical assistance helping startups implement metric -based
development processes
●Create accelerator programs specifically for companies building metric -validated
AI systems
●Develop innovation challenges focused on improving specific flourishing
dimensions
●Highlight exemplary companies using metrics to demonstrate their products'
benefits
●Support organizations developing metric implementation tools like the Flourishing
Foundation and Meaning Alignment Institute.8
By creating economic incentives for metric -driven innovation, these programs would 
accelerate the development of AI applications with empirically demonstrated benefits for 
human flourishing.  


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  11 7. Implement Metric -Based Protections for Children and Adolescents
Flourishing metrics would provide an empirical foundation for protecting vulnerable 
groups, particularly children and adolescents, from potentially harmful AI applications:  
●Develop specialized metrics for measuring AI's impacts on children and
adolescents
●Require rigorous metric -based impact assessments before deploying AI systems
for use by children
●Establish minimum flourishing metric thresholds that must be met for products
targeting vulnerable populations
●Create ongoing monitoring requirements using flourishing metrics for high -risk
applications
●Ban applications empirically shown by metrics to cause significant harm to
vulnerable groups
These protective measures would move beyond speculative concerns to evidence -
based regulation, using flourishing metrics to identify which applications truly benefit 
vulnerable populations and which may cause harm despite apparent conveniences.  
8. Deploy Flourishing Metrics to Inform AI Economic Policy
Robust metrics will enable us to refine our social and economic policy to develop and 
deploy AI in a manner that supports flourishing. As AI transforms the workforce, we 
need strategic approaches that maintain the connection between meaningful work, 
produc tive contribution, and economic well -being.  
●Bake flourishing metrics into the incentive structure of AI development by
increasing the bargaining power of institutions and communities in the AI market
●Pass The Data Freedom Act, creating regulated entities  which enable
organizations to collectively negotiate with AI companies, empowering them to
harness their data to align markets with flourishing metrics.9
●Create democratic governance structures for AI deployment  that incorporate
community input, enable regional customization, and empower communities to
shape how AI integrates into their social fabric
By empowering communities and institutions to participate in technological 
development, we create a virtuous cycle that enhances both innovation and social 
cohesion. This approach ensures AI development responds to the needs of diverse 
communities, strengt hening our resilience and competitive edge.  
9. Preserve Human Connection and Invest in Communities


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  12 Metrics can highlight precisely how AI increases atomization and isolation. We should 
utilize their insights to directly invest in the communities, relationships, and 
organizations that make flourishing possible.  
●Protect the value of relational work  by creating safeguards to ensure roles
centered on human connection, where human empathy and judgment are
essential —such as teaching, healthcare, caregiving, counseling, and community
organization —remain viable and valued
●Invest in spaces for community, meaning, and creativity  where people can
form connections, pursue fulfilment , and engage in exploration and creative
expression
●Support communities through technological transition  by helping local
institutions adapt to economic transformation, preserving social capital and
ensuring community needs are centered as technology reshapes social patterns
Through considering a whole -of-society approach, utilizing flourishing metrics to 
evaluate how AI is impacting communities holistically, we can get ahead of these 
transformations by strengthening community foundations before the most significant 
impacts ar rive. 
Addressing Potential Challenges  
Innovation Concerns  
Some may argue that additional governance frameworks will stifle innovation. However, 
our approach focuses on creating incentives and guidelines rather than imposing rigid 
requirements. By clearly articulating what constitutes flourishing - enhancing AI, we  
provide direction that can actually stimulate innovation toward more socially beneficial 
applications. Many investors and entrepreneurs are already seeking opportunities to 
develop AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human well -being. Ultimately,  we 
believe that researchers and policymakers should work with the grain of American 
technology companies, providing them with metrics that allow them to build the next 
generation of AI products that promote the flourishing of Americans and their 
communities.  
Measurement Difficulties  
Measuring impacts on human flourishing is inherently challenging, particularly across 
diverse populations with different values and priorities. Quantification is, in some 
contexts, insufficient to capture the idiosyncratic, qualitative nature of our values . We 
address this by developing multidimensional metrics that can be adapted to different 


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  13 contexts and by emphasizing the importance of ongoing research to refine 
measurement approaches.  
Industry Resistance  
Technology companies are rightly allergic to onerous regulation. But by involving 
industry in the development of metrics and creating market incentives through 
procurement policies, our approach aligns corporate interests with flourishing goals, 
reducing p otential resistance. Our research has found that many AI firms are already 
interested in limiting their liability for negative social effects, suggesting an opening for 
collaborative approaches to governance.  
Balancing Protection and Innovation  
There is a risk that protective measures could be overly restrictive. We propose a 
balanced approach that differentiates between high -risk and low -risk applications. This 
allows for targeted protective measures in high -risk contexts while encouraging 
innov ation in areas with less potential for harm.  
Our Vision: Metrics -Driven AI Development for Human 
Flourishing  
AI policy must do more than mitigate risks —it must actively strengthen the social fabric 
and enhance national resilience. Guided by rigorous metrics that measure its actual 
impacts on human flourishing, policymakers can ensure that AI serves human well -
being in ways that reinforce relationships, meaning, and communal flourishing. By 
moving beyond speculative claims, we can provide both AI optimists and skeptics with a 
clear framework for distinguishing between technologies that genuinely enhance well -
being and those that undermine it. In doing so, we can unleash American prosperity and 
national vitality, strengthening the institutions that sustain American life.  
Flourishing metrics are not just one policy recommendation among many —they are the 
foundation for responsible AI governance and long -term national strength. Without 
them, AI development will proceed without accountability, risking economic dislocation 
and social fragmentation. With them, we can systematically assess which AI 
applications genuinely enhance human life across multiple dimensions. These metrics 
provide the necessary framework to ensure AI fortifies America’s social fabric —the 
foundation of our national strength.  
By adopting these recommendations, the OSTP can position the United States as the 
global leader in human -centered AI governance. If America leads with metrics that 
embed human flourishing at the core of AI development, we can set a global standard 


Measuring What Matters  | The Human Flourishing Program  14 where AI -driven prosperity secures both our economic future and the foundations of a 
thriving society.
