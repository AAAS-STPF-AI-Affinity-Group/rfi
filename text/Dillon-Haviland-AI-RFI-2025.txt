AI operates in moral opposition to the hard working creatives in the world. It steals from them,
and aims to replace them. I do not support the use of AI for any use in any medium as it is apale imitation of what real people can do. 
Keep AI out of our country, especially as a means to profit. It should be sued into the ground
for everything it has already stolen from people do not allow it to continue
