General Comment
AI does nothing but steal from  artists who get nothing for it. Copyright will m ean nothing if AI is allowed to copy from  artists with
im punity, jobs will be lost, and they will no longer be able to sustain them selves with their craft. Already this is being felt, by hardworking
artists who are hundreds of tim es better than a program  that takes in art and spits out a lifeless piece that is often wrong. Let artists do
what they do best and pay them  for their work!
