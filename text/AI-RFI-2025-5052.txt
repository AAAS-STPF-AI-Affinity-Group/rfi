General Comment
Giving legal im m unity to AI com panies will com pletely destroy the creative capacities of Am erica and will cause m assive brain drain and
flight to other countries that take a harder line on protections for creatives and their work. Surrendering authority to unelected individuals
in the private sector would be a self-inflicted wound to the culture and econom y of this country.
