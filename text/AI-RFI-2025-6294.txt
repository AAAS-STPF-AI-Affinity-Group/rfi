General Comment
This ironically might be the most Com munist thing to occur in the nam e of busi ness, f&^%  over hard working Americans so one 
speci fic businessman can get rich off the hard work of hundreds if not millions of Americans while they get nothing in return (at least 
so-cal led wasteful jobs cut by the unelected Musk paid the people before they were wrongfully term inated). Let alone the 
environmental damage  ram pi ng up AI production will cause, but of course I don’t th ink anyone in the govern ment cares about that. 
Hell, I wouldn’t be surprised  if all of these com ments go into the virtual equ ivalent of a paper shredder, with about how much the 
govern ment cares to represent the  interests of its constituents (u nless they’re big busi ness/Israel, which the American govern ment 
loves more than its people).
