I am writing to urge against enacting the AI Action Plan. This plan would allow major tech companies to steal the
work and intellectual property of citizens. Why would an individual create new ideas if AI can then swoop in to useit without consequence? We have copyright for a reason, and AI should not be allowed to bypass those rules. If AIcompanies want to use that material, they can license it and pay for it. Anything else is theft.
