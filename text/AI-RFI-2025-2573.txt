General Comment
Gen AI is theft. Allowing com panies to train their AI on copyrighted m aterial is a disgrace to creators and should never be legalized. This
is an obvious ploy to m ake big tech AI people richer while actual artists will lose the rights to their own intellectual properties and will no
longer be able to share their creations with the world for fear of it being stolen by soulless AI. Gen AI is anti art and is all trash. I will never
support anything that uses Gen AI. The Trum p adm inistrationâ€™s policies have only caused harm  to the Am erican people and the world,
and this is no different. Gen AI should be regulated and copyrighted m aterial protected from  it.
