Dear M s. Plimpton , 
Thank you for the opportunity to shape the U.S. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) is dedicated to ensuring that healthcare is prioritized within this vital policy framework. We strongly advocate f or the integration of 
our AI principles for healthcare, ensuring that AI’s transformative potential is fully realized to improve patient care, protect privacy, and foster innovation across the healthcare landscape. Additionally, we are pleased to share our  factsheet, Ensuring Responsible AI 
Integration in Healthcare , which outlines the key principles for safeguarding the 
responsible application of AI in this critical sector. 
AMI A is the professional home for more than 5,500 informatics professionals, representing 
frontline clinicians, researchers, and public health experts who bring meaning to data, manage information, and generate new knowledge across the health and healthcar e 
enterprise. As the voice of the nation’s biomedical and health informatics professionals, AMIA plays a leading role in advancing health and wellness by moving basic research ﬁndings from bench to bedside, and evaluating interventions, innovations and pu blic policy 
across settings and patient populations.  
Ensuring Responsible AI Integration in Healthcare 
The AMIA  factsheet  outlines four critical principles for integrating AI into healthcare 
effectively and ethically:  
1.Transparency : Clear labeling and communication about AI tools' purposes, data
use, and impact on care decisions, ensuring informed patient and provider
engagement.
2.Validation and Monitoring : Establishing comprehensive validation processes and
continuous monitoring to guarantee AI tools’ safety, effectiveness, and fairness.


3.Reducing Burden on Providers: AI should streamline administrative tasks,
minimizing the documentation load on healthcare professionals.
4.Expert Collaboration : Involving clinical informaticians and policymakers in shaping
AI healthcare policies to ensure relevance and effectiveness.
By embracing these principles, we can ensure that AI is implemented in healthcare in a way 
that prioritizes patient safety, enhances care delivery, and minimizes administrative burdens. It is essential that we work together, guided by expert insights, to s hape policies 
that foster innovation while safeguarding public trust.  
AMIA Artiﬁcial Intelligence Principles for Health care  
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) refers to an array of computer technologies such as machine 
learning, deep learning, natural language processing, generative artiﬁcial intelligence and 
other mathematical and statistical techniques that seek to emulate human i ntelligence, 
e.g., “thinking” , in order to address highly complex problems, often involving vast quantities
of data and information.
In healthcare, AI systems are generally intended to lead to new knowledge, make 
recommendations or trigger actions via the development of complex algorithms, or processes, that analyze data, often in real or near -real -time, and can sometimes adapt to 
chang es over time. Such systems have the potential to advance medical knowledge and 
make healthcare safer, more effective, less costly, and even more equitable. There are, however, well documented risks associated with all aspects of the design, deployment, and maintenance of AI systems, particularly with respect to the potential for bias in many 
forms, including algorithmic bias.  
As growing numbers of AI systems are deployed in healthcare, the need for ethical 
principles and governance has become increasingly urgent so that biomedical  
informaticians can assure that AI in healthcare is developed with appropriate high�quality data; is introduced judiciously, in the appropriate environments; is used for impactful and meaningful purposes; with appropriate training and maintenance and in accordance with core principles that ensure respect, safety and equity for patients, providers, institutions, and society.  
AMIA Believes: 
Due diligence is required to address the risk of bias and safety in the use of AI in healthcare, which includes:  


• A set of core principles that govern all aspects of design, development, testing, 
deployment and maintenance of biomedical AI systems, products and services as support tools intended for use in healthcare, as well as in more consumer -oriented 
health and wellness applications.  
• Organizations that deploy or develop AI systems for healthcare be governed by a set 
of principles intended to assure that issues related to the context and purpose of 
use, maintenance over time, and other implementation issues are addressed.  
• Development and deployment of AI systems in healthcare should proactively seek 
to mitigate the potential unintended socio -cultural impact of such systems with 
particular emphasis on education, research, and the impact on vulnerable populations,  including groups that have been economically/socially marginalized. 
• The biomedical informatics community collaborates to create guidelines for implementation of the principles outlined herein that offer appropriate 
mechanisms, and where appropriate public and private funding, to assess the 
degree to which AI systems achiev e their purpose, with particular emphasis on 
principles that prioritize safety, trustworthiness, and equity. 
Based on these Principles, AMIA Supports : 
AI Systems Principles  
1. Autonomy – AI must protect the autonomy of all people and treat them with 
courtesy and respect including facilitating informed consent.  
2. Beneﬁcence – AI must be helpful to people modeled after compassionate, kind, and 
considerate human behavior.  
3. Non -maleﬁcence – AI shall “do no harm” by avoiding, preventing, and minimizing 
harm or damage to any stakeholder.  
4. Justice – AI includes equity for people in representation and access to AI, its data, 
and its beneﬁts. AI must support social justice.  
5. Explainability – Scope, proper application, and limitations of AI must be 
understandable and provided in context appropriate language.  
6. Interpretability – Plausible reasoning for decisions or advice in accessible language 
must be provided.  
7. Fairness – AI must be free of bias and must be non- discriminatory.  
8. Dependability – AI must be robust, safe, secure, and resilient. Failure must not leave 
any system in an unsafe or insecure state.  


9. Auditability – AI must provide and preserve a performance “audit trail” including
internal changes, model state, input variables, and output for any system decision
or recommendation.
10. Knowledge Management – AI systems must be maintained including retraining of
algorithms. AI models need listed creation, re- validation, and expiration dates
Principles for Organizations Deploying or Developing A I 
1.Benevolence – Organizations must be committed to use AI systems for positive
purposes.
2.Transparency – AI must be recognizable as such or must announce its nature. AI
systems do not incorporate or conceal any special interests and deal even-handedly and fairly with all good faith actors.
3.Data Sources – Data used for AI must be of the highest quality, applied appropriately
and purposefully (relevance), address merits and limitations when used, and adhereto FAIR principles.
4.Accountability – AI harm and unintended consequences must be reported,
assessed, monitored, measured, and mitigated as needed. Response to complaints
and redress must be guaranteed.
Principles to Address Special Considerations 
1.Vulnerable Populations – AI applied to vulnerable populations requires increased
scrutiny and appropriate community involvement to avoid worsening inequity in
healthcare.
2.AI Research – continued research, and research funding into AI in healthcare is
prioritized and required.
3.User Education - Developers of AI have a responsibility to develop, implement,
optimize, and sustain educational resources and programs that educate healthcareproviders and consumers on machine learning and AI systems used in healthcaresettings.
