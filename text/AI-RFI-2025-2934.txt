General Comment
AI right now is a dem entia riddled forgetful m ess that can't help giving wrong inform ation. It's not just wrong in m ost of what it says but it's
actively unhelpful as if I were to ask AI without guardrails to generate m e inform ation it will pull that inform ation from  thin air, even going
so far as to fake its own sources. Anything that cannot find legitim ate inform ation but gives you and answer and justification anyway has no
place being publicly available nor should it have access to public resources. It is a tool with a vanishingly sm all scope, that is if a learning
m odel has a few hundred pages to draw from  in its history is asked to m ake sum m aries it m ight be able to be accurate, but widespread
and publicly trained AI needs heavy guardrails in order to even be useful at all, let alone supported.
