No f&^% way.
Seriously, this is the stupidest thing to come out of the Trump White House and that's saying  
something. 
Stop propping up a failed industry that nobody wants, that sucks up a shocking amount of  
resources, that has no legitimate way of making money or return on its investors' stupid  
investment.
It's essentially a bailout for idiots who thought they could build the world of The Terminator.
And for that you want to give up copyright? The undergirding of the entire entertainment  
industry to say nothing of corporate rights to their own work product? Personal privacy and  
basic decency?
No one wants AI except people invested in AI. If you take away legal protections from  
everything else to feed it, you will spoil countless artists' lives and livelihoods in exchange for  
a product that will not create the jobs to replace them (to say nothing of those jobs being  
comparatively soulless) or replace the money to the economy.
Back away slowly and put the bad idea down.
