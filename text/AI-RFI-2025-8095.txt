General Comment
As with all com puting technologies, those that are currently deem ed 'artificial intelligence' should be subject to regulations that ensure the
safety and rights of the Am erican people. We should not allow technology com panies to steal our intellectual property, both because it
violates our citizens' right to profit from  our own work, and because it will lead to an erosion of the intellectual and artistic strengths that
have m ade this country an innovative powerhouse that effectively spreads our cultural values around the world. The current push for
generative AI and 'AGI' by large technology com panies has been an abject financial failure, and they are hoping to recoup their losses for
this m istake by fleecing the Am erican people. I do not support further propping up this losing venture, especially when it com es at such
high cost in term s of safety and valuable resources. If this technology is useful, let them  prove it in the free m arket, rather than com e
begging for special perm ission to steal from  hard working Am ericans, hoard the country's resources, or flat out grab tax-payer m oney.
