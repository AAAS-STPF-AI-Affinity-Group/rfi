The January 23 Executive Order (EO) on artificial intelligence (AI) states:  "It is the policy of the 
United States  to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human 
flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security." 
This response recommends: 
1.NSF's AI Action Plan  should aim to achieve the national policy goal of human
flourishing.
2.NSF's AI Action Plan  should include education in its approach to addressing this national
policy goal.
3.NSF's AI Action Plan  should enumerate specific steps NSF will  take to achieve the
national policy goal through its existing educational mission, such as investigating how
STEM  educational pathways can leverage AI; advancing measurement of factors closely;
and increasing each American's opportunity to learn about AI.
Details  in support of these recommendations follow, organized by three questions: why, how, and 
what. 
WHY INCLUDE "HUMAN FLOURISHING" in NSF's AI ACTION PLAN? 
NSF is uniquely positioned to support human flourishing. Although NSF plays an important role 
in supporting the other goals in  the EO—national security and economic competitiveness—other 
agencies have clear missions to advance these areas, too. NSF, however , has a clear opportunity 
to lead in human flourishing in ways that other agencies do not.   
First, NSF's leadership in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (STEM) has already 
expanded the well-being of all Americans. For example, NSF’ s investments in the underlying 
technology of the Internet have transformed communication, and interdisciplinary advances in computing and physics led to MRI technology that has revolutionized medicine. In education, applications of AI to support intelligent tutoring, for example, set  the stage for contemporary 
advances in AI-based tutors now being delivered by technology companies such as Duolingo, Khan Academy, Carnegie Learning, and more. NSF has an unparalleled track record of linking scientific discovery to human flourishing already, and can do more to achieve human flourishing in an age of AI. 
Second, improving education is essential to human flourishing. Americans will  need more and 
better ways to learn about AI to enable each person to realize the benefit of AI in their life. 


NSF-funded researchers already pursue evidence-based approaches to teaching and learning, and 
these approaches move from foundational knowledge to active use in curriculum resources, teacher training, educational technologies, assessment techniques, and more. NSF's education mission in STEM already includes AI in its scope, and within this existing scope, there is more NSF can do to produce the knowledge base needed so that each American can flourish by better incorporating AI productively into their learning and their long-term pursuits.  
Third, the review criteria that NSF applies in evaluating every grant proposal already specify a 
clear place to advance the "human flourishing" policy goal. One of two  review criteria is 
"Broader Impacts." When they write grant proposals, researchers can readily incorporate specific goals related to human flourishing with  AI as Broader Impacts and state  how they will  measure 
progress towards these goals. Reviewers can recommend grant proposals on the strength of their contribution to knowledge about human flourishing with  AI. Thus, NSF can readily incorporate 
the policy goal of human flourishing into its core work of inviting and reviewing proposals. 
To summarize why NSF's  AI Action Plan should addr ess the national policy goal of 
increasing human flourishing: NSF already has a track record that links  its scientific 
discoveries to human flourishing, has the educational mission essential to human 
flourishing with AI, and has a clear place to addr ess human flourishing in the heart of its 
grant review pr ocess.  
HOW NSF CAN ADV ANCE THE POLICY GOAL BY FOCUSING  
ON EDUCATION 
Human flourishing is a future-oriented concept, and today's learners are the future.  
The field of Education has been a strong early adopter of generative AI and the ways AI can 
directly contribute to flourishing of learners, and NSF’ s past investments have been critical in 
showing how it can. Examples abound: AI can help improve educators’ productivity; AI can strengthen students' learning experiences; AI can enable students to ask  stronger scientific 
questions and develop stronger scientific ar guments; AI can help students learn to solve 
problems together; and AI can support tutoring in STEM.   
Conversely, education has also been a primary arena for identifying the risks AI can pose to human flourishing. For example, if students use AI to do assignments in place of their own thinking, they will  not learn the lesson content and in turn, will  not be as likely to flourish.  
Similarly, if they use AI as a crutch in challenging learning situations, their reasoning may atrophy. We are just at the beginning of developing knowledge about human flourishing with  AI 
in education, and a strong program of NSF research is critical to ensure the strengths of AI are well-leveraged and risks are mitigated.  
Education is the societal activity that brings most Americans into contact with  AI, and thus 
presents an unmatched opportunity for NSF  researchers to gather evidence and build knowledge 


about human flourishing with  AI. Thus, including  education in NSF's  AI Action Plan will  
strongly advance the national "human flourishing" policy goal. 
WHAT NSF CAN DO IN STEM EDUCATION RESEARCH TO ACHIEVE THE 
POLICY GOAL  
First, NSF can lead through resear ch on how educational pathways can leverage AI for 
student success.  
NSF-supported research can generate knowledge about how educators and learners use AI to develop their knowledge and skills over time; how AI can be part of well-designed, ef ficacious 
learning experiences; and how both can lead to later successes in education, careers, and playing productive roles in society. Specifically, NSF has a long history of recognizing that successful education cannot only address an isolated unit of study, test outcome, or grade level, but rather must include a range of pathways through which individual learners advance their long-term goals. Without question, all learner pathways of the future will  come to include AI. By 
continuing its pathway focus as AI becomes commonplace in education, NSF can be a leader in generating knowledge about  the role AI can play in realizing the potential of every American while strengthening their well-being. 
Second, NSF  can support the development of measur es to track pr ogress towards human 
flourishing with AI in education.  
To achieve the policy goal, it is essential to have the necessary tools to demonstrate progress to 
the American people—and so that innovators can  benchmark their progress. NSF-funded 
research has already made enormous headway in developing measures of key factors related to
 
human flourishing. A partial list includes:  
●STEM knowledge (improvement in the skills, understanding, and dispositions that lead
to further participation in STEM  learning and careers);
●metacognition (the ability for each student to take charge of their own learning);
●agency (the ability for each student to make choices that align to and advance their ownlearning goals);
●creativity and innovation (the ability for each student to advance their own ability to
create new things purposefully); and
●teamwork (the ability for each student to work with  others to advance knowledge and
reasoning).
For example, the NSF’ s AI Institutes (including five Institutes that focus on education) are 
already making significant advances in how to measure these outcomes ef ficiently and 
effectively. By continuing to support the development of measur es, NSF  can translate the 
broad policy goal of "human flourishing" into concrete, measurable objectives that leaders 
across the United States can more readily apply and advance. 


Third, NSF  can support resear ch on innovations that enable people across the lifespan and 
in varied settings to develop knowledge and skills  necessary for their mastery of AI.  
To flourish, learners of every age need more and better understanding of AI. NSF is already a 
leader in supporting ef forts to ef fectively integrate technological advances (e.g., computer 
science, cybersecurity, data science) into education at every level. NSF's educational research investments have created outstanding opportunities for students to develop technological skills and knowledge starting in childhood, through adolescence, and as they enter adulthood and the workforce. Now, it is essential that NSF invest in research ef forts that build knowledge essential 
to enabling every person in the United States to learn AI in ways that fit their settings, needs,  and strengths.  
CONCLUSION 
NSF is well-positioned to lead the United States  on the national policy goal of "human 
flourishing" with  AI. By including its historic role in education within the scope of its AI Action 
Plan, NSF can lead the nation in producing benefits directly for each American and thus ensure 
the AI Action benefits each citizen. By building on the STEM  education research already 
completed about how people learn, NSF's action plan can have specific steps for further research in education that ensure the AI Action Plan  will contribute to human flourishing. 
Therefore, we recommend: 
1.NSF's AI Action Plan  should aim to
 achieve the national policy goal of human
flourishing.
2.NSF's AI Action Plan  should include education in its approach to addressing this national
policy goal.
3.NSF's AI Action Plan  should enumerate specific steps NSF will  take to achieve the
national policy goal through its existing educational mission, such as investigating howSTEM  educational pathways can leverage AI; advancing measurement of factors closely;
and increasing each American's opportunity to learn about AI.
