General Comment
Please block this, we absolutely need m eaningful regulations and lim its in particular on what AI is allowed to do and access.
The ecological im pact of training AI as it currently stands consum es ridiculous am ounts of energy and, in m any cases, precious freshwater
resources to cool these training centers. Many argue that the grid "can't support an all-electric lifestyle", and yet are blind to the fact that
this includes AI. AI already has stolen from  the livelihood of m any Am erican citizens, and without regulations like copyright protection for
citizens will continue to and leave its victim s with no recourse. 
Currently, sustaining AI puts incredible strain on resources that would be better allocated elsewhere. In a country where m any citizens
cannot count on having clean fresh water, training centers for AI are treated as a higher priority, using that water for cooling instead.
In addition, AI centers use a m assive am ount of electricity, putting unnecessary strain on the grids. 
Taking regulations off of AI and allowing it to steal any and all data its users please will only harm  Am erican people. Corporations have a
vested interest in having full access to citizens data - profit. Ultim ately they don't want to use these things to im prove the quality of life for
Am erican people, only to further line their own pockets and are using "national security" as a scare tactic to get what they want.
