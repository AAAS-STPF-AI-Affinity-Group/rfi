General Comment
I am  m ost concerned about the open-ended nature of the following directive "This order revokes certain existing AI policies and directives
that act as barriers to Am erican AI innovation, clearing a path for the United States to act decisively to retain global leadership in artificial
intelligence." Not only does ot not define what it is attacking and what will be swept away, it also seem s to suggest that the safeguards for
intellectual property will be ignored. We the public are supposed to com m ent on vague hypotheticals "certain policies". The jettisoning
laws in favor of dom inance seem s regrettable and probably a court case waiting to happen.
