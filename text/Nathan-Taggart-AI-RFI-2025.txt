AI using data from copyrighted material is fundamentally theft. This data is needed to make
any progress in the “training” of the AI. AI is taking work created by humans, shuffling it, andpretending to have made something novel. It is theft of intellectual property, it is a violation ofcopyright, and it is a deeply cynical thing to do with the sum total of human knowledge.
AI is deeply wasteful, expending truly ridiculous amounts of energy to shuffle training data
around to create the facsimile of intelligence. Regulations need to be put into place toregulate this technology and no company should be able to freely access copyright material.
