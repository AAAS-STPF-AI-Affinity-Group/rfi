General Comment
To those it concerns,
I am  a program m er and a Canadian. The policies of the US are a great concern to m e as a Canadian, especially ones that concern Large
Language Models (LLMs, which, for the purposes of this com m ent, will also refer to "AI" in general). Our countries are close and tightly
coupled.
Many of m y friends are in the US, and m any of them  are artists, writers, and program m ers. We are just individuals who have few
protections from  large com panies taking our work and using it to "train" their LLMs. I do not want m y creative work to be used in these
"AIs" without m y perm ission. I do not want to see m y friends creative works absorbed into "AI" without their perm ission.
Please strongly consider the ram ifications of broadening what data can be used from  individuals without perm ission.
Please consider what protections of creatives it erodes.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
a concerned Canadian
