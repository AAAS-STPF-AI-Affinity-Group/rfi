General Comment
If AI is allowed to circum vent copyright, it will lead to the m ass and instantaneous counterfeiting of every piece of copyright m edia on
earth. Source code, all form s of m edia, and every written word will be subject to the m ost com prehensive form  of plagiarism  on the
planet, all because som e salesm en want us fooled into thinking their chat-bot will be able to save the world "at som e point in the future."
This is because it has been proven m any tim es that any data or m edia that AI is trained on can be accurately recalled with the appropriate
prom pt (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13188.) Based on knowledge of m y field, anyone with the basic skills required to de-com pile source
code could easily replicate im portant copyrighted software for resale (through the use of Generative AI,) denying royalties to the original
creator, and fatally diluting the m arket for enterprise-level software developm ent.
In the m ean-tim e, all incentive for program m ing, art, writing, etc. will vanish in the U.S., leading to one of the largest brain-drains in U.S.
history. Every com puter scientist, artist, film m aker, etc. would be out of their m ind to try to sell or publish their works in a country where
they have no protections to guarantee they are paid for it. We would truly becom e just like China: a place where only wealthy- and state-
sponsored m edia is protected from  theft.
