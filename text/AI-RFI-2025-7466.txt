General Comment
In an online clim ate that is already rife with m isinform ation and willful ignorance of facts and science, creating m ore dubious AI generated
writings and im ages will only lead us further into chaos. Our education num bers are laughable on a global level (and will continue to
worsen if the abolishm ent of the Departm ent of Education com es to fruition); leaning into this faulty, biased, and im m orally created AI will
only tank our statistics entirely. 
This is just one of m any short-sighted, profit-driven, and m isguided m issteps that this adm inistration has taken. Proving again and again
that this adm inistration is prioritizing profits over its own people.
