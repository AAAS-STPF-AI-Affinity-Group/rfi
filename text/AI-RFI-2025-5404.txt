Opposition Letter


Hi, I’m a writer who specifically has had their work trained and used for AI against my wishes to 
be used for characters I helped create in commercial works without my permission for 
advertising that I did not condone. However due to this misuse of copyright, because of how 
new this technology was, I was unable to fight against the corporations that did it.
This administration’s AI Action Plan should focus not on giving away creator content to Big Tech 
companies, but rather on ensuring a fair marketplace with competition:
First, the government should ensure that creators and everyday Americans give effective 
consent, so that we can decide when and where our work is used by AI systems.
Second, the AI Action Plan should encourage a robust licensing marketplace, so that the 
incentive to create for small businesses is preserved. Our work has immense economic value, 
so the value generated by that work should accrue to the original creators, not just Big Tech.
Finally, the AI Action Plan should require transparency from Big Tech companies, requiring 
them to disclose what material is in their training datasets, and label what content is AI 
generated.
