General Comment
Once upon a tim e there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantm ent upon her of a fearful
sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a
terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attem pted to free her from  this dreadful
prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room  of the tallest tower
for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek
Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can
do to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now
Ogres, huh, they are m uch worse. They'll m ake a soup from  your freshly peeled skin. They'll chew
your livers, squeeze the jelly from  your eyes. Actually, it's quite good on toast. Back, back beast,
back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run away. Yeah! And stay out. Wanted.
Fairytale creatures. Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give m e that. Your fine days are over. -25
pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Com e on. Sit down there! And be quiet! This cage is so sm all.
You wouldn't turn m e in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please, give m e another chance.
Oh, shut up! Next. What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I'm  not a puppet, I'm  a real boy. Five
shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. No! Please, don't let them  do it! Next. What do you
got? Well, I've got a talking donkey! Right. Well that's good for ten schillings, if you can prove it. Oh,
go ahead fella. Well? He's just a li..., just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. You
boneheaded donkey! That's it. I have heard enough. Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I can talk. I
love to talk. I've talked to... Get her out of m y sight! -No, no, I swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He
can fly! He can talk! -That's right, fool! Now I'm  a flying, talking donkey! You m ight have seen house
fly, m aybe even a superfly. But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly! Seize him ! Get him ! This way!
Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the order of lord Farquaad. I am  authorized to place you both under
arrest. And transport you to designated resettlem ent facility. Oh really? You and what arm y? Can I
say som ething to you? Listen, you were really, really som ething, back there. Incredible. Are you
talking to... ...m e? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you were really great back there
with those guards. They thought that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There
was tripping on over them selves like babes in the woods. That really m ade m e feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom
with your own friends? But I... I don't have any friends. And I'm  not going out there by m yself. Hey
wait a m inute. I have a great idea... I'll stick with you. You and m e in green fighting m achine.
Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary. Maybe you don't
m ine m e saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you
definitively need som e tic-tac or som ething, 'cause your breath stinks! Man you've ??? m y note!
Just like the tim e... ...and then I ate som e rotten berries. Man I had som e strong gases leaking out of
m y but that day. Why are you following m e? I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm  all alone, there is no one
here, beside m e. My problem s have all gone. There's no one to derive m e. But you got to have
free ... -Stop singing! Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend
would be that truly honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at m e! What am  I? A... ...really tall? No!
I'm  an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and pitchforks. Doesn't that bother you? Nope. Really?


-Really really. Oh? Man, I like you. What's your nam e? A..., Shrek. Shrek?! But do you know, what I
like about you, Shrek? You've got that kind of: "I don't care what nobody thinks of m e" thing. I like
that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right. Uh, look at that. Who would wanna live in a place like
that? That would be m y hom e. Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful. You know you're quite a decorator. It's
am azing what you did with such a m odest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess,
you don't entertain m uch, do you? I like m y privacy. You know I do to. That's another thing, we have
in com m on. Like I hate it when you got som ebody in your face. You try to give them  a hint and they
won't leave. And then there's that big occurred silence, you know? Can I stay with you? -What? Can
I stay with you, please. Of course! -Really? No. -Please! I don't want to go back there. You don't
how is like to be concerned like a freak. Well..., m aybe you do. But that's why we have to stick
together! You got to let m e stay! Please! Please! OK
