General Comment
Please vote against allowing generative AI access to copyrighted works. No copyrighted work will be safe, m illions of dollars will be lost,
it is com pletely rem oving the ability for individuals to protect their work. How can anyone claim  that any work is protected by copyright
law when generative AI can steal it? Please deny billionaire tech com panies the ability to steal from  hardworking Am ericans!
