Input on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  
Submitted in Response to Federal Register Notice 2025 -02305  
Executive Summary  
The accelerating pace of artificial intelligence development demands an unprecedented, 
coordinated national effort akin to the Manhattan Project. Current trends indicate AGI 
(artificial general intelligence) could emerge by 2027, with superintelligence likely by 
20301.  To secure U.S. leadership, mitigate catastrophic risks, and harness AI’s 
transformative potent ial, we propose a government -led initiative to:  
1. Mobilize trillion -dollar compute/power infrastructure  
2. Establish military -grade security protocols for AGI labs  
3. Solve superalignment challenges  
4. Outcompete authoritarian rivals  
This paper synthesizes technical projections, geopolitical imperatives, and policy 
frameworks to justify urgent action.  
I. Strategic Necessity of a Government -Led AI Project  
A. The Intelligence Explosion Timeline  
• 2027 AGI Threshold : Current scaling trends (~0.5 OOMs/year in compute + 
algorithmic efficiency) suggest AI systems will match human researchers by 20271. 
• 2030 Superintelligence : Post-AGI, recursive self -improvement could compress 
decades of progress into months1. 
• Economic/Military Dominance : The first nation to achieve superintelligence gains 
decisive strategic advantages1. 
Failure to lead risks existential threats: either from unaligned AI or authoritarian control.  
II. Technical Imperatives  
A. Compute Mobilization  
Component  Scale Required  Current Status  
GPU Clusters  $100B–$1T by 20271  Private sector plans $10B clusters

Component  Scale Required  Current Status  
Power 
Infrastructure  +10–30% U.S. grid capacity1 Limited new nuclear/transmission 
projects  
Chip Production  100M+ H100 -equivalent 
GPUs/year  TSMC/Samsung constrained  
 
Recommendation : Coordinate DOE, DOD, and private sector to:  
• Fast-track permits for AI -dedicated nuclear plants  
• Subsidize domestic GPU foundries  
• Establish national AI compute reserve  
B. Lab Security  
• Current Vulnerability : Leading labs lack protection  against state -level espionage1. 
• Required Measures : 
• SCIF-level physical security for  AI-model training facilities  
• NSA-led counterintelligence programs  
• Export controls on frontier model weights  
C. Superalignment  
Challenge  Status  Required Investment  
Value Learning  No proven methods for human+ 
models1 $5B/yr for control research  
Scalable 
Oversight  Limited testing at GPT -4 level  National adversarial red teaming 
program  
Fail-Safes  No "off switch" for superhuman AI  DARPA-led containment architecture 
R&D

III. Geopolitical Dimension  
U.S.-China AI Race Analysis  
Factor  U.S. Advantage  China Advantage  
Compute  Current lead in cutting -edge chips  Faster infrastructure buildout  
Talent  Global researcher concentration  Domestic training pipeline scale  
Data  Open internet access  Surveillance data reserves  
 
Critical Window : 2025–2027 to lock in hardware/software superiority before AGI tipping 
point1.  
IV. Policy Recommendations  
1. Establish a National AI Directorate  under NSC authority  
2. Allocate $200B  for 2025–2027 compute/power buildout  
3. Mandate MIL -SPEC security  for all frontier model training  
4. Launch Apollo Program -scale alignment initiative  
5. Forge Five Eyes AI Alliance  to counter authoritarian bloc  
 
Conclusion : 
The choice is stark: lead the AI revolution through focused national mobilization , or cede 
the future to unaccountable actors. By combining public -sector resources with private -
sector innovation, a 21st -century Manhattan Project can secure humanity’s trajectory 
toward beneficial superintelligence.
