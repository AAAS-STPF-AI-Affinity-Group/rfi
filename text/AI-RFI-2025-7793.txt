General Comment
The US governm ent CANNOT allow AI to run ram pant without intense regulations. Doing so will allow AI com panies to steal the work
of hardworking individuals to use them  for their own profit.
Additionally, it will allow deceptive audio and video clips to be used for nefarious purposes. NOTHING good will com e of allowing AI to
run ram pant without any regulations.
