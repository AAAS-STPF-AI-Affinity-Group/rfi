General Comment
Calling it “Artificial” “Intelligence” is flim sy at best, and dangerous at worst because this isn't intelligence at all; it's a wood grinder that
takes the work of others and regurgitates what it *thinks* the concept it got fed back to the chucker about what it “thought” the chucker
m ight like. Google and/or OpenAI m ight think it's better than the creatives and hard workers they're stealing from , but tell their “search
engines” or “learning m odels” that they're feeding lethal inform ation that will kill people without a care in the world. It will not listen.
This is nonsense, we've been at a fine pace so far with our current laws, don't pass the stupidity on, let it die
