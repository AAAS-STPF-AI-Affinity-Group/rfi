reducing legal ambiguity.  
Evidence & Case Studies:  Legal uncertainty in AI -generated content has stalled product releases 
and prompted caution in open collaboration. The EU AI Act  includes early examples of model 
ownership guidance and content provenance.  
Potential Benefits:  Greater legal certainty, higher rates of AI commercialization, and reduced 
friction in innovation partnerships.  
Alignment & Collaboration:  Aligns with U.S. IP law modernization initiatives, and AI R&D 
priorities under the CHIPS and Science Act.  
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS  
For AI developers, especially in open -source ecosystems, the lack of consistent attribution, IP 
licensing clarity, and enforcement mechanisms can stifle innovation. Developers also face rising 
concerns around IP theft and unauthorized model replication acr oss borders .  
Recommended Policy Action:  Mandate baseline content provenance tools and digital signature 
mechanisms in federally supported AI toolkits and open -source registries.  
Rationale:  Responsible innovation requires visibility into where models and their outputs 
originate. Watermarking, licensing metadata, and usage audit trails offer scalable safeguards.  
Evidence & Case Studies:  Open -source platforms embedding licensing metadata (e.g., Hugging 
Face Model Cards) have shown improved reusability and legal clarity.  
Potential Benefits:  Greater innovation confidence, improved enforcement of ethical use, and 
enhanced global trust in U.S. open -source leadership.  
Alignment & Collaboration:  
Supports NIST AI Risk Management Framework  and global interoperability initiatives . 
PUBLIC SECTOR & POLICY ARCHITECTS  
To sustain U.S. AI leadership, national policy must promote innovation ecosystems while 
updating IP regimes and competitive safeguards. This includes addressing strategic IP risks, such 
as exfiltration of AI models, model inversion, and knowledge extractio n from deployed systems

14 Recommended Policy Action:  Integrate AI competitiveness metrics and IP protection standards 
into federal innovation policy, while supporting cross -agency coordination to track global IP risks.  
Rationale:  Innovation flourishes in environments with clear rules and robust protections. 
Competitive advantage can be lost if novel models or datasets are compromised before 
commercial maturity.  
Evidence & Case Studies:  The DeepSeek.ai case , where leaked LLM weights undermined 
proprietary model investment , is a cautionary example of unprotected IP eroding billions in R&D 
value .  
Potential Benefits:  Greater resilience in AI innovation, higher domestic IP retention, and stronger 
alignment with national economic priorities.  
Alignment & Collaboration:  Aligns with the National AI Strategy, NIST Cybersecurity Framework , 
and international IP treaty modernization efforts.  
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
INNOVATION VELOCITY  
AI is evolving at an unprecedented rate, surpassing the adoption curve of many innovative 
technologies before it . Its disruptive capacity spans nearly every sector, challenging traditional 
regulatory, workforce, and innovation processes. Policy frameworks must account for this 
velocity by supporting adaptive, real -time governance and flexible deployment pathways that 
enable safe experimentation without stifling growth.  
Federal action should recognize that the speed of AI innovation is not just a competitive factor but 
a strategic imperative. Responsive policy mechanisms, accelerated approval pipelines, and agile 
public -private collaboration will be essential to ensure th e U.S. remains a global leader as AI 
continues to reshape scientific discovery, national security, and economic competitiveness.  
AI ENABLED ECONOMIC RESILIENCE  
AI is rapidly becoming foundational to economic resilience, enabling real -time response to 
market volatility, labor disruptions, and global supply chain instability. Its ability to model 
complex systems, forecast shocks, and optimize operations positions A I as a critical buffer 
against systemic risks across sectors.  
Federal action should treat AI not just as a catalyst for growth but as core infrastructure for 
economic continuity. Policy must incentivize AI integration into essential systems —
manufacturing, energy, logistics , while ensuring access for SMEs and regional economies. 
Adaptive funding models, resilience -focused AI testbeds, and cross -sector scenario planning will 
be key to hardening U.S. economic systems against future disruptions.  
CONCLUSION  
The AI Applied Consortium affirms that the United States is at a pivotal juncture in shaping AI’s 
trajectory to advance national prosperity, security, and global leadership. As AI rapidly transforms

15 every facet of the U.S. economy , from infrastructure and innovation to education and governance , 
it is also revolutionizing long -established sectors like manufacturing, logistics, and energy.  
AI’s dual -use nature is central to this shift. The same technologies driving commercial innovation 
also underpin critical defense capabilities, making AI a strategic asset that demands proactive, 
forward -looking policy.  
To lead responsibly, the U.S. must adopt frameworks that are adaptive, innovation -driven, and 
risk -calibrated , reflecting AI’s speed, dual -use dynamics, and potential for both economic growth 
and systemic risk. Coordinated public -private action is essential to build the infrastructure, 
regulatory environment, and workforce needed for sustainable leadership.  
The Consortium calls for federal action to support modular infrastructure, scalable workforce 
development, open but accountable AI systems, and strong protections for security, IP, and civil 
rights.  AI must be recognized as vital to economic resilience , enabling agile responses to supply 
chain disruptions, climate risks, and geopolitical challenges.  
As a trusted cross -sector body, the AI Applied Consortium stands ready to support federal 
partners with strategic guidance, implementation expertise, and cross -disciplinary coordination 
to translate policy into actionable, lasting impact.
