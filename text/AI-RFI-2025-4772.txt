General Comment
The AI bubble is bursting. No one except for rich CEOs like AI, and we're just waiting for it to die. Giving these dorks access to
copyrighted m aterial is not only com pletely idiotic, but com pletely pointless. It won't change the fact that they'll be bankrupt within a year
or two.
