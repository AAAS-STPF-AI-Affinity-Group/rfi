General Comment
More often than not, generative AI can give you incorrect, if not dangerous, inform ation. Also, art generated by AI has no soul. You can
tell it wasn't m ade with love by an actual artist.
I, along with m any Am ericans, call for restrictions on generative AI by prohibiting training their data sets on the likeness or content of an
individual.
