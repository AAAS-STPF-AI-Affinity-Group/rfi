General Comment
Do not let OpenAI use copyrights m aterial to train their AI, it is STEALING! It steals jobs, it steals m aterial, it consum es so m uch energy.
The Governm ent want to im plem ent it to control very sensitive sectors, if anything, AI should be outlawed and Open AI should be shut
down or banned from  Governm ent affairs. Again, it steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off theft. You cannot possibly
support that.
Please stop OpenAI from  being able to m ake things worse. 
A com pany that has to steal from  Am ericans to work, is not a com pany that should exist.
