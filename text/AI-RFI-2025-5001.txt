General Comment
Allowing the unchecked use of AI would have devastating effects on inform ation security worldwide. Malicious spyware, revenge porn,
and scam  bots would run ram pant with com plete and total im m unity to the law. If this act passes, I can prom ise that neither m yself or
anyone I know will vote for a single representative who supported it ever again.
