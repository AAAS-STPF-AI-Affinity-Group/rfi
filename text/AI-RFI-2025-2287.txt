General Comment
This is a dangerous banket wide infringem ent on copyright holders and artist's protected works! If an artist or copyright holder want to
offer to train their AI, they can do it on their own prerogative. This would allow tech com panies to blatantly plagiarize hard works of artist
and writers and even endanger their livelihoods.
This should not go through! Generative AI in its current form  is im practical! It's a giant carbon footprint hole and no am ount of nuclear
power plants can fill it without m ore perilous workarounds! Using AI to plagiarize creative and written works is a bad use of generative
AI! It's prone to hallucinations that could m islead the public! This is all just another m eans to lock end users into using services of the
oligarchy (e.g. Google, Microsoft, etc.). Protect the rights of creators instead!
