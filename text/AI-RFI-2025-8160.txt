General Comment
AI does not have a future in the business, political, or technological future of the united states. It steals from  the livelihoods of artists and
profits off of them  without com pensation, and should at the very least be investigated and potentially be shut down and regulated. It is a
fleecing scam  on the Am erican people and indeed the people of the world, and has no place in the future.
