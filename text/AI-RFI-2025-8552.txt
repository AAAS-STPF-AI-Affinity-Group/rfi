General Comment
AI doesn't belong in art. Art is hum an expression, intended to evoke a feeling. AI is m echanical regurgitation without inspiration, intended
to bypass the artistic process and the labor of artists, rendering feeling m eaningless. Not to m ention it's wildly inefficient, consum ing power
via com pute and storage. Lastly, it's direct theft of artistic copyright.
AI can have valid uses, like in m edical research. It has no place in art.
