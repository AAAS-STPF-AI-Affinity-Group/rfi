General Comment
As som eone who m akes their living through their writing, I believe that granting OpenAI a license to steals m y work and the work of other
artists is a betrayal of hum anity in the pursuit of profit, a prioritization of big business over individual rights, and an unconscionable
giveaway to Big Tech. Itâ€™s worse than the opening of the m ythical box of Pandora, a bell that cannot be unrung.
