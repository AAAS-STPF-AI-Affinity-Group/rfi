I respectfully submit the enclosed proposals to the Office of Science and Technology Policy 
for consideration in the development of a new AI Action Plan. As U.S. companies lead advancements toward artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI) and eventually artiﬁc ial 
superintelligence (ASI), we stand at a critical turning point that could signiﬁcantly reshape global power dynamics.  
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is aggressively pursuing dominance in AI, leveraging 
substantial resources, including forced labor practices. As the leader of the free world, the United States has a responsibility to ensure that AI development remains ro oted in 
democratic principles and does not permit authoritarian regimes, like  China, to spread 
autocratic inﬂuence through AI technologies.  Below are my suggestions to achieve this 
goal.  


Sustaining U.S. AI Leadership and Innovation 
America must vigorously invest in AI research and development (R&D) through increased 
federal funding to agencies like NSF, DARPA, and DOE. Public -private partnerships should 
expand to drive innovation and commercialization of AI breakthroughs. Establishing a 
lightweight National AI Research Infrastructure will establish a framework for  access to 
essential computing and data resources, supporting research institutions nationwide.1   
Unlike our allies in Europe2, American policy frameworks should prioritize innovation -
friendly environments  for the private sector , minimizing restrictive regulations, while 
maintaining open innovation through publicly available datasets, IP protections, and 
support for open -source development.  
Countering International AI Competition 
China and other nations are rapidly advancing their AI capabilities3, making strategic 
competition imperative. The U.S. must protect its leadership by investing signiﬁcantly in semiconductors, edge computing, and strategic AI applications, ensuring secure domestic supply chains.  
Targeted export controls  and tariffs  should safeguard sensitive technologies
4 and bolster 
American dominance5 in AI  without isolating American ﬁrms from global markets.

Ensuring AI Access for All Americans 
To avoid exacerbating the existing technical deﬁciency in our population , the U.S. must 
ensure universal broadband access, particularly in rural and economically disadvantaged 
areas, enabling full participation in AI -driven services.6 Additionally, expanding community 
technology centers, AI labs, and computing resources will promote access to all 
Americans.  
In education, AI literacy must be integrated at all levels. Federal grants should support schools to introduce AI -focused curricula, while workforce initiatives should offer AI skills 
training and upskilling programs .  
National AI Infrastructure and Research Priorities 
Establishing a permanent National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) is essential, providing AI researchers access to advanced computational tools.
7 Investments should also target 
regional AI innovation hubs and support the development of energy -efficient data centers.  
Expanding open datasets in critical sectors like transportation, health, and climate 
resilience will empower startups and academia to develop innovative solutions efficiently. 
Governance Frameworks for Responsible AI Innovation 
Governance should adopt ﬂexible, risk -based frameworks, emphasizing voluntary 
adherence to standards like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.8 Regulatory 
sandboxes and voluntary certiﬁcation programs should be encouraged to build trust 
without hindering innovation.  
An AI Advisory Council comprising stakeholders from academia, industry, civil society, and government should regularly evaluate and recommend governance adjustments.

Building an AI -Ready Workforce 
The U.S. must signiﬁcantly expand its domestic AI talent pipeline through enhanced STEM 
education programs nationwide. Dedicated AI -focused curricula and scholarship programs 
at universities, community colleges, and vocational schools should be prioritize d.9  
A national AI Upskilling Initiative could provide apprenticeships and retraining 
opportunities for workers impacted by automation, supported by federal incentives. Our 
country must aggressively pursue an “build from within” philosophy toward our AI 
workforce of the future.  
Accelerating AI Adoption in Government and National 
Security  
Federal agencies should lead by example, integrating AI solutions across operations, 
facilitated by Chief AI Officers and a centralized AI Center of Excellence.10 A dedicated AI 
modernization fund would incentivize impactful AI -driven projects.  
The Department of Defense must accelerate AI adoption to maintain strategic superiority, including enhanced funding for the Joint Artiﬁcial Intelligence Center and agile 
procurement processes.
11 Intelligence and cybersecurity capabilities must also leverage AI 
to strengthen national defense.  
A formal national security coordination body will ensure strategic alignment and effective 
governance of AI technologies across government agencies.

Conclusion 
This comprehensive, policy -driven strategy will sustain America’s global AI leadership, 
promote access, and secure economic and national security advantages through 
responsible AI development and deployment. I appreciate this opportunity to contribute 
and stand ready to support the implementation of the AI Action Plan.
