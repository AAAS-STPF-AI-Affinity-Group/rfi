General Comment
An industry that can only survive by breaking the law is not an industry that can or should succeed. This takes away Constitutionally
granted rights from  citizens. This is an affront to hum an creativity, the rule of law, and econom ic rights. Do not look away for one
exploitative com panyâ€™s benefit to the detrim ent of all.
Copyright violation should be prosecuted. If the inform ation is that im portant, license it. Use the LEGAL avenues available.
