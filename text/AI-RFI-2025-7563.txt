General Comment
This is unneeded in Am erican business com m erce and should not be allowed to operate in exception to copyright law. This endangers the
sanctity of Intellectual Properties and proprietary solutions that foster healthy com petition in the capitalist m arket. AI, like m any failed tech
trends such as NFTs, is a short sighted fad that will only hurt society, econom ics, and the environm ent- it should be m ore regulated, not
less. It possess safety, security, and privacy concerns that left unchecked will only bring m ore disfunction that will take m ore m oney,
resources, and energy to undo in the future. AI will only serve to take away jobs from  the Am erican people and is an inefficient, resource
excessive solution to other possible econom ic solutions. Foundational rework and innovation should be the focus and be led by hum an
initiatives. AI is not only theft of knowledge but is a m oney sink and waste of potential where resources can be allocated into other m ore
stable and widely accepted endeavors that will better bolster Am erican society.
