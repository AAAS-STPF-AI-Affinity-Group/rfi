General Comment
Legislation on AI protecting copyrights for hum an artists and writers should’ve happened yesterday. Big tech is training their AIs on art
that the artists then receive no com pensation for. Artists have always been left on the fringes but this is theft in broad daylight and as it
currently stands, terrible for the environm ent. It brings nothing but m oney to those who sit on m ountains of it already. Prove you absolutely
don’t care about hum ans, their financial well being, rights, and their potential by supporting AI.
