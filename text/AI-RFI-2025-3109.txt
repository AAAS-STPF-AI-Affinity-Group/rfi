General Comment
AI generated content cannot exist without taking the hard work and labor of others and I believe it holds no place in the future of the US.
If it can use copyrighted art and writing freely without any repercussions, then copyright law m ight as well not exist at all. The process by
which it generates said content also uses tons of energy, which is costly and bad for the environm ent. I do not believe generative AI will
benefit society at all.
