General Comment
There is no reason why the hard working artists of Am erica should relinquish the rights to their art to corporations who wish to replace
them . It is frankly em barrassing that I even have to speak up about this, but all this bill does is give every artist a reason to stay the hell
away from  the U.S.A.
