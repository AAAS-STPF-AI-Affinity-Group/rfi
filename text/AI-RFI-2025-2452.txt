General Comment
If anyone can use tradem arked, copywritten, or otherwise non-public use data, without paym ent to the owner of the data, under the guise
of training AI, then there is nothing about tradem arking or copywriting that is protecting our assets. AI is blatantly stealing from  the hard
work of others and should have to pay for it.
