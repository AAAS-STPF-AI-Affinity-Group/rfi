General Comment
Generative AI needs to be regulated to keep it from  dom inating digital and intellectual spaces with stolen content. Social networks, news
sites, search engine results, and classroom s are already being polluted by trash content produced by AI. Without regulation, the US will
not lead in AI dom inance over other nations; it will lead in being dom inated by AI. AI does not produce any innovation of its own.
