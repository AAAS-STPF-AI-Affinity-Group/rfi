General Comment
Regulations against AI should not be weakened, but strengthened, as generative AI is a threat to all creators and creative works in the
United States. If the restrictions against AI are weakened, then large com panies could casually steal the hard work of creators without
facing any repercussions. This would cause untold am ounts of harm  to all creative industries in the U.S.
