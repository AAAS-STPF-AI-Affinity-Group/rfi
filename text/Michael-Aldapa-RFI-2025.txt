Using AI to control weapons functions.  
1. Every single firearm has a micro chip AI " GPS Tracking System"
The concept... Every Firearm knows it is in a " No Shoot Zone "  just like GPS in a handgun or
assault weapon, knows it is in a school, or a church, movie theater, grocery store, apartment
complex, etc...
2. Therefore the hand gun or assault weapon will automatically shut off and not allow it to fire
any bullets if the trigger is pulled in the designated " No Shoot Zone" area.
Or .. immediately after 1 round is discharged in the designated " No Shoot Zone " area then  the
firearm will lock and not allow anymore bullets to be discharged.
