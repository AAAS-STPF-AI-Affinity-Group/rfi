General Comment
Theft of copyrighted content by AI m odels is actively harm ing m y ability to do work, and enjoy the creative pursuits which I've spent so
m uch of m y life dedicated to because the product of m y work is under a m uch greater threat of theft than ever. If AI com panies in the
United States are unable to function without stealing from  the work of honest, non-thieving Am ericans, then they do not deserve to exist.
We are better than this; the exploitation of creative work by AI com panies will only lead to the stagnation of the Am erican arts and
sciences, the death of industries, and lack of opportunity. Please--regulate and fetter the ability of AI com panies to conduct this wholesale
theft, restore sanity, and value the rights of Am erican innovators and creators to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Don't give AI com panies a
free pass to steal from  Am ericans.
