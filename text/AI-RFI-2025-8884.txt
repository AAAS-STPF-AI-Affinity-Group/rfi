General Comment
Hello,
AI developm ent should not be supported at the expense of copyright. Copyright laws exist to protect intellectual properties of all types. If
AI is allowed to bypass these laws, who's to say these laws actually m ean anything? This will be a slippery slope to additional industries
lobbying to destroy copyright laws.
I am  an artist, and I enjoy drawing art as gifts for people. I enjoy writing short stories for people. If AI is going to be allowed to use m y art
in its collections regardless of m y feelings, I would rather not draw or write at all.
AI is grossly unethical, as it is incredibly detrim ental to the health of the environm ent, and it is often supported by cheap outsourced labor
in third world countries. People who are paid pennies for hours of work is not "artificial intelligence," it is effectively slavery.
Studies have also shown students who rely on AI technologies to support their scholastic studies retain less inform ation and skills than
those who don't. Is this what we want as a country? If the whole purpose of funding AI developm ent is to further Am erica, then it has
failed at step one.
The hype for AI is both tem porary, and too costly both m onetarily and in m aterial worth regarding the environm ent. It would be better to
take all the funds directed towards AI and instead funnel them  towards education to ensure future generations can build a better future.
Thank you,
