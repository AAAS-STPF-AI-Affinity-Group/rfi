Good morning,
AI is being used for purposes that hurt American citizens and ruin their ability to make a
living. Artists deserve compensation for and ownership of their work, both of which are utterlyignored by the promulgation of AI without any sort of federal protection for human beings.
 
Use this moment to redirect AI to utilitarian uses and away from the creative works copyrightwas meant to protect and that human artists have been making since the birth of our species.
 
Thank you,Marley Nelson
