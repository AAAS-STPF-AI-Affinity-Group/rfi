General Comment
I am  opposed to giving any AI com pany, including OpenAI, im m unity from  lawsuits. The ability of AI to use copyrighted m aterial without
perm ission or com pensation to the creator is unjust, and writers, com posers, and artists should have the right to pursue com pensation
through civil litigation.
