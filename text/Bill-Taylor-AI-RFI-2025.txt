The worry about malevolent computers spontaneously deciding to exterminate mankind is
silly.  I am far more concerned about malevolent humans using AI, big data, or cyber hacking
to attack me or just building bombs or buying guns to kill me on general principles.
The great murderers of recent history, Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, didn't use computers; they
killed millions and millions of people with nothing but file cabinets and telephones.  
Malevolent humans don't need computers to be a major threat to mankind.   Until we solve the
problem of evil humans, I won't worry about a theoretical future malevolent AI.
After all, how hard is it for parents to instill motivation in their kids?   Someone would need to
impart Artificial Motivation (AM) into computers.   We don't even have a Turing test to
measure motivation.Computers do what they're programmed to do.
  I worry far more about bad guys programming
computers to attack me instead of worrying about AM deciding to attack me on its own.
