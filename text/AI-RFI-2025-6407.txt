General Comment
I think that AI has done and will continue to do m ore harm  than good, especially without lim its. I don’t think that AI has a place in the
future in this country that I care about so m uch. Any place that AI is granted with regards to this country’s future will Ruin the lives of
Millions of Am ericans including m yself. There is abundant evidence which shows that AI profits off of Theft, and sm all to m edium  creative
enterprises are and will continue to be unilaterally and disproportionately affected by AI. Sm all to m edium  creative enterprises are one of
the backbones of our entire society, and they represent the livelihoods and passions of Millions of our citizens. It is Far too overhyped,
and it is so overhyped that it is clouding the judgem ents of som e of m y fellow Am ericans and leaving them  in the dark with regards to just
how harm ful AI is.
If this act goes forward, this country, that m yself and m illions of others are proud to call hom e, is DOOMED.
