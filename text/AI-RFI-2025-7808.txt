General Comment
AI has no place in the creative world, where artists already struggle to support them selves. Even m ore so than regular persons or entities
should AI be subject to copyright infringem ent laws. AI is an extrem ely volatile tool that, until we have a m uch m ore com plete
understanding of, it would be better to overregulate at this juncture.
