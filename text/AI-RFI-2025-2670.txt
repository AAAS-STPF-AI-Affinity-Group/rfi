General Comment
The technology described as "artificial intelligence" is a house of cards. All it does is steal from  the people with actual talent and force it
into a soulless m achine designed to am algam ate actual creative works and replace jobs designed for real people, with the additional
downside in that it chews through valuable m oney and resources like water and electricity. The econom y is currently in sham bles and an
EO of this m agnitude will cause irreparable harm  towards both the people this negatively affects and all creative m arkets them selves.
