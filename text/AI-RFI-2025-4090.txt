General Comment
Greetings. I would like to leave a com m ent about the dangers of rem oving copyright protection from  copyrighted works to train AI as
there will be disadvantages posed for everyone including OpenAI if this passes. Given the intention to cut copyright laws this gives other
individuals the opportunity to also train their own AI on your works without pay or credit since you will also be vulnerable to sam e law
and since AI isn't copyright-able, you cannot do anything som eone decides to. So it would be in your best interest to refrain from  allowing
OpenAI to freely use copyrighted works in their training.
