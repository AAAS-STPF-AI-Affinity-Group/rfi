General Comment
Generative ai runs the risk of stealing from  artists.
Also google uses ai to silence com petitors.
I don't want com panies like google to have free reign to use m y pictures, m y artwork, m y writing to train a.i and essentially steal m y hard
work for a profit. If I wanted to m ake open source m aterial i would do so and there would be DIALOG as opposed to how big tech
com panies sim ply scrape m y work without perm ission. 
If anything m ore regulation needs to be put on big tech.
