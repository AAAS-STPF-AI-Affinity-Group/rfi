General Comment
You absolutely m ust respect copyright laws in the developm ent of this program . Stop stealing from  artists and writers. That's one of the
few jobs of governm ent the business com m unity and the creative com m unity can both get behind. Any other project is forced to respect
copyright and tradem ark protection, why not AI?
