General Comment
You m ust respect copyright and stop the infringem ent of intellectual property by AI m odels. None of the com panies or governm ents
developing m odels are weighing the negative ram ifications of their product, environm entally or ethically. It does not and will not do what
they prom ise, it is not worth the billions being poured into it to keep it afloat but it will m ake news less trustworthy, elections m ore fraught
and dam age copyright. There are only downsides.
