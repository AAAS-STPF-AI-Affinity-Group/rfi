General Comment
I don't accept this action plan as written.
Copyright exists to preserve intellectual property and respect the efforts of hum ans who ideate, create, and build things m eant to benefit or
entertain other hum ans while ensuring the creator is properly com pensated for their labor. 
AI does not, by the strictest standards, labor in a way that is m eaningful in this context. We don't allow people to get away with
plagiarism ; we should not perm it AI to com m it the sam e kind of intellectual theft in the nam e of 'training'. Training AI does not qualify as
fair use, and the existence of AI unregulated as it is right now is actively harm ing the livelihood of countless Am ericans, with that num ber
growing. 
Do not perm it AI unfettered access to copyrighted inform ation without due transparency, consent, disclosure, and com pensation to the
rights holders. 
Am erica should not be advanced by way of grifting and theft. We m ust do this responsibly if it has to exist at all.
