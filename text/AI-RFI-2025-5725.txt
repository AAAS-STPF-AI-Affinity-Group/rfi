General Comment
Advances in so-called "artificial intelligence" are m erely a ploy by m oneyed interests to provide carte blanche for said interests to create a
surveillance state where any faults and injustices can be blam ed on a faceless algorithm . In addition, those in favor of this "artificial
intelligence" are attem pting to bypass any sort of worker and artist protections by allowing corporations to legally steal the output of those
workers and artists without paying any form  of royalty or com pensation.
