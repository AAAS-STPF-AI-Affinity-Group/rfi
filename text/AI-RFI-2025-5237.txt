General Comment
I believe generative AI has no place in the United States as it is a technology reliant on the theft of art and intellectual property. Itâ€™s
im plem entation without any consequence would negatively im pact thousands of Am ericans and their livelihoods. Generative AI is also
heavily reliant on trem endous consum ption of energy that is clearly not sustainable and is a threat to the environm ent and should be
considered a threat to national security.
