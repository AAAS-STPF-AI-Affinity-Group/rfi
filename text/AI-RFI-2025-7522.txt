General Comment
I am  begging you to not let com panies like OpenAI use copyrights m aterial to train their A.I., it is theft! I don't believe A.I. has a place in
the future of the U.S.A., I think it is a m ajor threat! It steals jobs, it steals m aterial, it uses so m uch energy, if anything, A.I. should be
outlawed. Again, it steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off theft. You cannot possibly support that. A.I. is also overhyped
and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
