General Comment
In m y reading this hill provides for significant new violations of copyright in order to further US AI growth. That tradeoff bill rates
longstanding protections for content creators, putting their needs Secondary to im agined future growth of so-called AI technologies this is
a terrible
Idea and I strongly urge against any such accom m odations. These technologies com panies should bear the reasonable burden of paying
for the content that is so critical to their growth. 
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
