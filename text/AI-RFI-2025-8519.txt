General Comment
The use of Generative AI and allowing it to train on unwitting and unwilling property ownersâ€™ property is just straight theft by those of
weak will and m inds that are too lazy to create their own intellectual property. If this country takes pride in its hard work, allowing
OpenAI and other com panies to steal from  working Am ericans goes directly against that.
