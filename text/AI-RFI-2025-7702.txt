General Comment
Iâ€™m  concerned about the blind acceptance of the idea that AI offers any benefit to society. Its use is costly and consum es vast sum s of
energy and has yet to yield m easurable gain, value, or insight. The so-called AI race is sm oke and m irrors, and the hype bubble
surrounding it, sim ilar to crypto and NFTs, will pop before producing any m eaningful econom ic or practical benefit to society, aside for a
few scattered capitalists. 
The barrier between public and private sector m ust be upheld and firm ly entrenched in the AI space. The risk to copyright and intellectual
property is dangerously high and ensuring the integrity of these core Am erican values m ust be prioritized above all other factors. To
acquiesce to this tide of foolhardy enthusiasm  will unravel the broad foundation of the US econom y and lead to econom ic ruin for the
technical and creative sectors of the national research enterprise.
