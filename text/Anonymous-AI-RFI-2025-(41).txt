I completely oppose the AI action plan, allowing AI to steal the intellectual property of people (Art, Writing and
other creative expressions) only will enable AI to generate more material that could have disastrous consequences inthe case where AI and real life do not have anything to distinguish between.
Generally, the pretense of “National Security” is not a good enough excuse to enable theft. The lives of people who
make our entertainment, art, games and music are all under constant threat from AI.
AI has no place in the entertainment industry, allowing it to steal from people is utterly criminal.
