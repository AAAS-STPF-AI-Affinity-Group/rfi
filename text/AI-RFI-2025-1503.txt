General Comment
AI com panies should NOT be allowed to train (steal) copyrighted works. Current U.S.Copyright laws, as well as the Berne Convention,
that protect creators, artists, m usicians, writers, etc., and that protect Intellectual Property m ust be protected from  these AI com panies,
otherwise the U.S. will not be able to com pete in any creative arena with the rest of the world. There will be ZERO incentive for anyone
to create anything of value in the U.S. anym ore. AI generated slop that steals artist's work and spits out an ugly reconstituted blend of
slop, does not add value, it takes away value, and m ost people see how ugly and lam e it is. Not only will allowing AI com panies to train
(steal) copyrighted works, destroy the art industry, art and artists in the U.S., no one will want to buy ugly AI slop from  the U.S.
