General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is an oxym oron. OpenAI is a theft com pany and they m ade a theft m achine that puts people out of work, does a bad
job at form ing text and im ages without knowing context, and spreads m isinform ation. I do not want this and m any will agree with m e,
especially those who are already losing their jobs because these things can do a worse job cheaper FOR NOW. AI generative m odels
will m ake it m ore expensive to access after m ass adoption so they can ruin the econom y and send us into a new econom ic depression. I
do not want this agency to be open, and I do not want the governm ent to be partnering with private com panies that ruin the nation. Please.
