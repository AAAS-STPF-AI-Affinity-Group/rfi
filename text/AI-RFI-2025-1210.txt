General Comment
""AI"" is nothing m ore than a sham  that spreads harm ful disinform ation at the cost of Everyone on the planet. AI, NFTs, etc. will pull the
rug out from  norm al citizens with no billions to line their pockets, all while siphoning off the creativity and hard work of writers, artists, and
anim ators. Real people who m ake real work with their own hands. The world is burning for your hubris, and if you continue encouraging it
all of the clim ate related deaths and refugees will be on your hands!! YES TO HUMAN ART, NO TO AI!! STOP KILLING THE
PLANET!!!
