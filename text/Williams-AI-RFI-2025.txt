A.I. i s destroying our natural environment and resources. Specifically, water and electricity
producti on in the long and short term. It’s bad enough that Trump doesn’t believe in Climate
Change. He’s further burdening citizens with his demand for A.I. A pr oduct that routinely lies,
produces no original output, and uses a Lake’s worth of water for every interaction to cool the
multitude of computers that power it! Life isn’t the Jetsons or the Matrix. A.I. is functionallyuseless right now and a net negative for society. In a time of climate collapse the last thing we
need is to embrace A.I. just because everyone dreams of getting money for nothing.
