General Comment
AI does not have a place in the future of Am erican creative or intellectual life. Its ability to produce is based on stealing the work of
others, regardless of copyright status, and its owners are not interested in paying for the work their software relies on to exist. Not to
m ention the environm ental and electrical resources that are used to produce shoddy work filled with hallucinated data. AI is a scam
against the user, for real artists and writers, and for the Am erican public in general
