Allowing  Generative AI companies free access to copyrighted works not only puts thousands
of business at risk and millions of citizens at risk, the unrestricted use of generative  AI from
companies such as Open AI has allowed an incredibly dangerous and exceedingly harmful
flood of misinformation, disinformation, online scamming through visual and voice deepfakes. Thousands of freelance workers as well as thousands of businesses rely on propercopyright laws in order to safely work and allow proper economic business flow with millionsof dollars being kept safely flowing through all business sectors while proper safeties are kepton copyrighted works. Allowing privatized
 companies unrestricted  access to copyrighted
works would only further create damages to factual information and creative works in allsectors of business from independents
 and freelance workers to large corporations as every
instance of generative AI use by companies and by private citizens has been met with intensebacklash, criticism, and negativity resulting in loss of consumer base and lost revenue.
It has been reported and documented on several occasions in several business in which
generative AI has been implemented, promising higher productivity and easier workflow, havecaused an influx of incorrections, false information, and easily avoidable mistakes that normalhuman employees would avoid but then need to fix numerous times from the unreliability ofgenerative AI's implementation in sectors of business where it should not belong, resulting inmore hostile and stressful working conditions and costing businesses time and money oneasily avoidable and needless corrections. Furthermore the unrestricted uses of generative AIfrom private citizens and companies alike has put heavier strains on power grids across thenation in which generative AI data centers operate through near constant activity, burningthrough more fuel resources and causing strain on power grids that put their functionality atrisk during peak hours of use daily and in times of emergency needlessly put emergencyservices at risk.
To put it simply, the use of generative AI has been met with nothing but rejection and heavy
criticism from the public and has caused an immense money sink in the technology sector thatthe generative AI companies are trying to displace through forceful integrations into othercompanies in nearly all levels of business that cause an exceeding strain on workers anddamages to the companies that use generative AI, thus the notion that giving these generativeAI companies less restrictions and free reign on copywritten
 work would cause significantly
more harm across the nation. DO NOT ALLOW their failures and shortsighted businesspractices cause further harm to the American public or economy and DO NOT ALLOWgenerative AI companies unrestricted access to public copyrighted works.
