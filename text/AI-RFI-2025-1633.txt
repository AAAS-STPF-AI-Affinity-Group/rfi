General Comment
it should not be legal to feed som eone else’s copyrighted work into an AI and generate work from  it. That should be considered stealing
som eone’s intellectual property. If the system  depends on using other people’s work without the owner’s perm ission, it should not exist. It
should be strictly enforced that AI cannot be trained on copyrighted works
