General Comment
Generative AI is not the wonder tool you believe it to be. It is a a plagiarism  m achine that devours copyright protected m aterials and spits
them  out into a soulless hallucination of half truths or straight up lies. Generative AI steals huge am ounts of inform ation for very little
benefit. 
Additionally, it is a huge security risk to use a m odel where you don’t know where the training data has com e from . If you haven’t trained
the m odel on carefully selected data, you will never know if it contains m alicious inform ation that will poison the m odel. 
Finally, generative AI has a m assive negative environm ental im pact. The energy consum ption and water usage are enorm ous. Energy that
could be used to power grids in Texas to prevent people freezing in their hom es. Water that could be used to save Californians from
terrible wildfires.
