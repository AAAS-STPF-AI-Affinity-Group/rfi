General Comment
The theft of copyrighted m aterials by AI cannot happen. It threatens the livelihood of creatives and constitutes the illegal theft of written
m aterials and other intellectual property. It is patently absurd that the governm ent would even consider AI trained on copyrighted m aterials
to be a lawful, valid, or even desirable thing.
There is a race to control data and bilk the public of every last dim e. And AI is at the forefront.
Generative AI is useless, the end product is bad, and the environm ental costs are clearly not worth it.
AI is the tech industry's last gasp at attem pting to stay relevant and offer a product. AI isn't going to save anyone or anything. It's a
useless, soulless distraction of no im port or utility.
