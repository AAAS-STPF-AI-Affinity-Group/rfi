General Comment
As som e one who works on a field heavily invested in citation, I find allowing LLM and other such AI agents to use art, text, and other IP
without proper sourcing or following copyright laws highly problem atic. The only difference between this and a hum an copyright infringer
is that the AI has been program m ed by a hum an to go the infringing for them . 
AI program m ers should be held to the sam e standards that other occupations are and this should have to obey the sam e laws.
