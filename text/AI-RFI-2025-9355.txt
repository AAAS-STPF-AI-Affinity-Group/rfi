General Comment
Copyright laws exist for a reason. Please don’t get rid of those laws. We need people to m ake our art, to inspire our people. It will ruin
jobs for so m any people and take away their livelihoods in a country that’s already falling into a recession. Allowing openAI to override
copyright laws will only m ake that worse.
