General Comment
I think AI has no place in the future of Am erica, it detracts from  people pursuing a the Am erican Dream  if others can freely take their
work without com pensation. We are telling the Am erican individual they do not m atter to pursue and protect their ideas. Our strength has
com e from  the freedom s people feel — knowing their ideas are copyrighted and protected — to com e up with things that will m ake the
future of am erica great. We cannot rely on AI to rehash on what has already been done and prevent the future creativity. 
I am  an artist, I want to know that m y fundam ental rights are protected. That I am  not som e product to be stolen from . That the future of
this country I love is not to be plundered.
Furtherm ore, we already have studies com ing out that AI restricts the ability for hum ans to com e up with m ore solutions. For our
protection, great m inds, and future once m ore we m ust not let AI run ram pant because it is a pretty new toy. No, we m ight fight for the
people who m ake this country great. The artisans and the thinkers who we idolize so greatly. We lose out on our culture significance and
power as a nation by caving so carelessly the whim s of AI tech corps.
Say no to AI, say yes to the Am erican people.
