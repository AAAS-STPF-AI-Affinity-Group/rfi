General Comment
This plan to bring data scrapers together and train them  off of the hardworking Am erican people is a bit despicable. This "AI" business is
not true artificial intelligence, but a m im icking m onstrosity that learns by feeding upon the everyday m an.
I urge the Whitehouse to seriously reconsider it's position to push this disruptive and invasive theft of the people's privacy. If this sounds
wild, I would rem ind you that from  the start generative AI and the chatGPT m odels have been thrown together by being fed the works,
notes, and writings of people without their approval or even knowledge. It is disgraceful to this country that this AI bill would even be
considered plausible.
