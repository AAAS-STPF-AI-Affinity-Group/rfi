General Comment
AI as a shortcut is fundam entally theft. AI does not create, it does not dream  and build like that of a hum an. It coldly, calculatedly steals
directly from  real creators and real people. It's designed to m im ic and fool, not to actually create som ething new.
Rem oving all legal protections against AI theft is not only grossly irresponsible, it opens up the flood gates to so m any other problem s for
consum ers and em ploys alike. Jobs will be lost while com panies cut jobs from  their staff using AI to steal work from  actually working,
paid individuals.
As a tool, it has its place in helping existing creators, but as a replacem ent, it is theft. Do not protect thieves, protect us from  the thieves.
