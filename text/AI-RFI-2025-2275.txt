General Comment
gen AI is terrible. It is NOT intelligent! It's horrifically incorrect way too often to be im plem ented in any form  of governm ent. People
WILL die due to AI random ly generating it.
Do NOT im plem ent AI into any level of governm ent, just let actual hum ans m ake actually good decisions.
