General Comment
Generative AI is a dead-end technology with no clear use case. It is not fit for any of its stated purposes, but produces a close enough
facsim ile of som ething useful that the grifters propping it up have been able to keep stringing investors along and foisting it on the rest of us.
If this technology had any value beyond propping up a speculative bubble, its boosters would have enough m oney for com pensating the
authors and creators whose work they claim  is integral for the utopian vision of the future they prom ise.
OpenAI says they cannot m ake their product work unless they are allowed to steal our labor. The truth is they can't m ake it work period,
and the truth is also that their "need" to steal our work does not entitle them  to take it.
If our work has value, they m ust pay to use it. If it does not, they don't need to steal it. It's that sim ple.
