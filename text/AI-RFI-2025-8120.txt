General Comment
"AI" as currently conceived of is absolutely theft on a trem endous scale.
A sim ple rule should be introduced: "If it is not explicitly public-dom ain work, it should not be free for AI to be trained on, and consent
m ust be obtained for each individual thing." Period.
Or, is it cool if I walk into your house, steal your TV, and walk out because, hey, I wanted to watch it and you happened to have one? I
m ean, that's basically what this AI stuff is doing to creatives of all categories, from  m usic on down.
