General Comment
The way this is stated is that any copyrighted m aterial is legal for them  to use as they please. This would include other AI program s using
other AI to train their m odels. Rem oving the legal block of using copyrighted m aterial would ham per the future of Am erica in the favor of
"progress". How m any people would get affected by this? Millions would be affected. Not just artists or writers but program m ers, voice
actors, script writers, gam e developers and office workers to nam e a few. Once they lose their work where does the m oney com e from ?
No one but a handful of people will have m oney to spend on anything because there would be no legal recurse for people not to have their
content or m aterial used in AI against their wishes. This will hurt Am erica's people and it's long term  interests.
