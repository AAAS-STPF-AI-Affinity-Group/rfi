To Whom It May Concern,
I am a creative artist in the United States, and I have relied on copyright protections to protect
my work.
The stated direction of removing protections and restrictions on AI development are likely to
do more harm than good. The so-called benefits of AI, particularly  Generative AI, are minor at
best and actively empower harmful behavior. Allowing companies to circumvent laws thathave protected creators and helped America become the dominant cultural force in theworld
 seems to me short-sighted. Killing the golden goose, the creators who actually make the
original content, so to speak.
And worse yet, all the content that has been created so far has been woefully cringe.Thank you for your time,
-Elmer Concepcion
