General Comment
I don't think having copyrighted works entered into a data set for AI without perm ission is even rem otely fair use. Do the entities creating
the data sets profit from  having copyrighted works in there? Obviously, they do. They are stealing what they clearly see as extrem ely
valuable intellectual property... m uch of which the creators would not choose to share at all if given the option.
AI is a tool created to m ake a profit, AI is not a person. AI has no "right to read". AI is for profit. Let the creators of AI buy the right to
read content from  those willing to sell it to them . We have to pay for copyrighted content, as we should... why should AI com panies get it
all for free and then get to regurgitate it for profit at the expense of creators?
