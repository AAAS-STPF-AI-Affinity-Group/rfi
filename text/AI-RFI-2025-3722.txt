General Comment
The use of generative AI as im plem ented in m odern software applications CANNOT be ethical. All generative AI system s, including
ChatGPT, Copilot, etc., are built on a corpus of data that includes art, writing, and m ore that was not sourced from  consenting authors.
As such, its output is, by definition, plagiarism . At worst, it could be a violation of tradem ark, copyright, and even patent. An Am erican
plan for AI *cannot* be built on such tenuous legal grounds without exposing the governm ent to a risk of a wide swath of lawsuits, or
without stifling the ability of artists and authors to create and have confidence their work will be protected. A chilling effect on the ability of
artists to create would stagnate Am erica's position in a variety of fields from  which AI content is scraped, rather than enhance our position
(or "dom inance").
I strongly urge the governm ent to carefully consider whether they want to take those risks.
