General Comment
The CEO of Open AI has speci fically con firm ed Large Language Models and other generati ve AI tech nologies operate by steal ing. 
This CLEARLY violates US and international copyri ght laws. Also, their output is absol ute s&^%. It's not rel iable, it's just try ing 
to predict what the most likely output shou ld be. It reg ularly si mply lies in order to sou nd sm art. There is no benef it to them , and 
INSANE risk to using them .
