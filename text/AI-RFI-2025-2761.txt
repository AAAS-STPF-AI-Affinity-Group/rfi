General Comment
Hi, just wanted to say that I think AI can do a lot of dam age to the incredible assets Am erica has built over the years. We are the cultural
center of the world, our m usicians, artists, producers, actors and writers set the pace for all of hum an culture and have done so for
generations now. 
Copyright laws exist to protect exactly this wealth and should not be discarded without serious consideration. 
Are we building this AI tech for Am ericans or are we building it for Silicon Valley investors? It's hard to tell when protections we benefit
from  are revoked in the nam e of progress.
