General Comment
Allowing AI to avoid copyright restrictions is going to be disastrous not just for the Am erican people but for corporations. Allowing
anyone to use generative AI with copyrighted m aterials will both im pact the bottom  line of com panies and im pact brand im ages. Malicious
individuals would be able to generate content that portrays various intellectual properties in a negative, offensive, or shocking m anner. This
content could then be accessible by children on the internet, resulting in a situation sim ilar to the content farm s of Elsagate. Im agine that,
but ten tim es worse and with ten tim es the am ount of vulgar filth our children will be exposed to. This is the future that our children will be
forced to live through if regulations regarding AI and copyright are not upheld. Generative AI has no place in the future of the United
States of Am erica, and we as a nation should be com m itted to protecting intellectual property, regulating the content that is posted online,
and protecting our children.
