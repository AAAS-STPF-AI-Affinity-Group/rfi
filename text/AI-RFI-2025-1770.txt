General Comment
The whole AI developm ent and especially generative AI tools are out of hand at the m om ent. They do not disclose what m aterials they
are training on, and from  the result we can derive that they are indeed stealing m any artists' intellectual properties without their consent.
This is a serious violation of free will for every individual. Further m ore, they are creating a toxic environm ent for future generation, by not
encouraging kids to focus on cultivating their brain and developing skills, m aking them  into slave consum ers in the the future. Not to
m ention, it is also affecting m any industries and m any individuals are out of work, and it is a terrible situation econom ically. Last but not
least, the data centers are depriving planet resources leaving poorer hum ans from  underprivileged areas to even m ore horrible living
conditions, and they even have to fight for water. When there is no buyers, there is no harm . We m ust all be aware what's involved and
take the right action before it's too late.
