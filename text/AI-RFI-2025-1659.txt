General Comment
What was the point of setting up copyright law the way we have, if you just decide som e people don't have to adhere to it? It's blatantly
pointing out that our legal system  does not apply equally and evenly to everyone so do the right thing, and hold AI com panies as
accountable as you hold the rest of us.
