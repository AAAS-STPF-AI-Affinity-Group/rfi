General Comment
Ai does not need to ignore copyright law. Ai does not deserve to ignore copyright law. When it ‘trains’ on a library of im ages from  the
internet it is stealing m inutely from  each one. It is theft, and this action should not go forward. Do not be im pressed by open ai just
because they throw a bunch of word salad at you. Generative AI will always be theft.
