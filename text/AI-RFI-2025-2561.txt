General Comment
Generative AI causes m ore harm  than good. *Certain* AI is good, like the kind that was used to distinguish bread types and accidentally
figured out how to spot cancer cells. GenAI, the kind that scrapes unknowing people's data to spit out garbage and wastes innum erable
resources, is not. It will do the opposite of what you intend it to. Not to m ention, privacy is a m ajor issue.
AI is m eant to do well what hum ans are horrid at, not to do horribly at what hum ans excel in.
