General Comment
I believe that giving "AI" com panies unlim ited access to Am erica's artistic output will not be good for Am erica. Am erican artists will leave
the country and live som ewhere else that actually respects the arts and doesn't feed them  to plagiarism  m achines that hallucinate im ages
and text that is devoid of intent, m eaning, or craft.
