The necessity of foundational machine learning theory in understanding AI systems and
mitigating AI risk
Mitigating AI risk has become a topic of intense effort in recent years and months. The purpose of
this comment is to make a case that developing a fundamental theory of deep and other foundational
model learning is a prerequisite for managing risk as our society transitions to wide use of AI technology.
Theory in this context refers to identifying precise measurable quantities and mathematically describing
their patterns, the way it is used in physics and engineering, rather than necessarily proving rigorous
theorems. While, admittedly, even a comprehensive theory of deep learning cannot guarantee a successful
AI transition, without such theory, however, we certainly would not be able to control or defend against
misuse of AI systems as their behavior is already of similar or exceeding complexity compared biologicas
systems or humans.
Never before had a technology been deployed so widely and so quickly with so little understanding of
its fundamentals. Given the societal impact of rapidly developing AI, this is a matter of urgent importance.
In the past, mathematical theory has been “unreasonably effective” in describing and helping to engi-
neer physical processes used in modern technology. Every electric device uses laws of electromagnetism,
GPS systems use both special and general relativity to compute accurate locations, chip production and
imaging technologies use quantum mechanics, the list goes on. While large amounts of hard empirical
engineering work are required to design a bullet train, a space rocket, or a computer chip, we have a solid
theoretical grasp of the underlying principles. Even though our understanding of AI is far less developed,
there is real hope that such fundamental principles may exist and can be discovered and used to under-
stand, monitor and control advanced AI systems. This is evidenced by recent progress in the theory of deep
learning, including rethinking of overfitting and model complexity, theory of infinitely wide neural net-
works, optimization for over-parameterized systems and the emerging understanding of low-dimensional
feature learning.
While investments in LLMs and other deep learning systems, have recently skyrocketed and now rep-
resent a major portion of all technological investments, relatively little funding goes toward basic theory
of machine learning. In the past, fundamental science had often operated on a different timescale from
technological development. We do not have that luxury now. Given an unprecedented pace of techno-
logical and societal change, it is hard to see what is coming in the next few months and years, let alone
decades. Understanding the fundamental theory of deep learning as well as large foundational models
and applying these analyses to real systems is a compelling and urgent need that can only be addressed if
research funding agencies in the nation align on this key goal.
