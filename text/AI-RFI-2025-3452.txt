General Comment
AI has m any useful im plications for solving technological, m edicinal, production, and even scientific problem s. Generative AI, however,
does not "solve" any issues when it com es to the artistic m edia. Ranging from  2D, 3D, digital, traditional, m usical, cinem atic, or web
based, AI does not and cannot "solve" art. AI only copies what it knows, by stealing from  the production of content creators. Any piece
of m edia uploaded to the web that was created from  hours of work by an artist becom es com prom ised when generative AI seizes hold of
it. This not only hurts the artist by stealing all the work they just com pleted, but also m akes their work easier to exploit. Com panies and
corporations will then use AI to replicate the work of other artists so they can turn a profit. This is theft, and infringem ent. 
This technology has surpassed its purpose for solving problem s to "creating" im ages that contain traces of stolen work. Making the im ages
feel lifeless, oversaturated and detectably insincere. Artistic integrity and pay have been short changed in order to save a sm all profit. 
Art is not m ade with the push of a button or a typing of a com m and. Art is an understanding and a skill. 
Just like the fad with NFTs, Generative AI is doom ed to fail. The technology is already cannibalizing itself with its own feeds and the
public has caught on to its lies and lifelessness. Therefore m aking Generative AI a bad investm ent.
