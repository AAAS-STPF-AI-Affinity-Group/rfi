General Comment
AI cannot be perm itted to use copyrighted im ages in their data sets. Giving an AI the ability to train on copyrighted im ages sets an anti-
social precedent that spits in the face of all creators. This will harm  ALL creative businesses and m ake even prom oting one's art
work/businesses very dangerous to their incom e and also destroy any m otivation to even be creative. I do not consent to any of m y work
being used to train AI, and I know that m illions upon m illions or creative people will agree with m e.
