General Comment
As an artist who has spent their entire life crafting their skills, AI is an insult to the creative field. For the record, I am  not entirely Anti-AI,
I think it's am azing that science and technology has evolved to m ake things easier and m ore assessible to others. But technology such as
this should be used for m edical studies, psychology, and how to better our industrial world. NOT the creative world!
The point entirely of creativity is a reflection of the HUMAN experience. There is no life or fire inside the void eyes of AI for it sim ply
cannot understand the intensity of the hum an experience. There is no shortcut and there is no quick answer to that.
Not to m ention how harm ful these generators are to the environm ent. Is killing the only planet we have worth 10 seconds of pseudo
"expression" to sate narcissism ? I think not. L
