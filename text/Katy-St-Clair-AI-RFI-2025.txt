Katy St. Clair, 
My name is K aty St. Clair and I am a second semester senior at Avonworth High School. I 
studied ge nerative AI and its impact on politics for two months in a course on AI and Ethics 
this year. From my research, I believe there should be more regulation when it comes to 
generative AI. Using AI to promote a party ultimately undermines public trust in the 
government. Civilians want to hear what real people can do to help them if elected. At -
home generative AI systems such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home need to be regulated, 
and multiple reports of bias have come out regarding the devices' answers to some political questions. This should not happen, the machines either need to decline to answer political inquiries or have a regulated list of proven facts they are  allowed to discuss. During 
the 2024 election, President Donald J. Trump reposted AI -generated photos to his millions 
of followers on Twitter or X. The pictures showed a popular celebrity at a Trump rally wearing MAGA gear offering support to the candidate , however, it is incredibly misleading to 
viewers, especially those who may look up to the celebrity. It also is extremely unprofessional for a politician to blatantly post misinformation in any situation no matter 
the type of media. Tighter regulations are also needed on image generation AI, ideally there 
should be certain words and phrases that AI cannot recreate due to current political issues. This is because supporters of candidates use this AI to create fake, misleading, and vulgar images of other candidates. I feel that using AI in political campaigns is a lie to the people of America.
