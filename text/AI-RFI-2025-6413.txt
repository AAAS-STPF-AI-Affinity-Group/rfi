General Comment
Com panies should not be allowed to steal from  creators of any kind in order but especially not to train their AI. To call what exists now
AI is actually ludicrous and there is currently no problem  that it can actually solve beyond spit out a bunch of rehashed info that already
exists, often with incorrect inform ation. Giving it m ore info will not im prove the tool. Unqualified support of AI already has ill effects:
without people thinking through solutions, we cannot arrive at correct solutions. Critical thinking skills will continue to atrophy is AI is
presented as an answer giver. It does not give answers but rather supplies inform ation that again, is often wrong to som e degree. When
investors realize that AI is not giving them  a return on their investm ents, they will be angry and slow to adopt new technologies that will
actually be useful.
