General Comment
I strongly oppose excepting AI from  copyright regulations and allowing to take creative works without com pensation. Large language
m odels can't answer questions, only predict what an answer looks like, and are unsuitable to be regarded as sources of knowledge even if
OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, or any other com pany m ay be pushing to put AI assistants into everything consum ers m ay use. Disregarding
hum an creative work for AI would be enorm ously detrim ental to the country, as it would directly incentivize com panies to take the work
of others to produce inferior substitutes for hum an work. Large language m odels can't create, they can only m ash together what they've
seen before according to probabilities they've learned from  giant bodies of works taken without com pensation from  the people who
worked to create them .
If a com pany cannot be profitable without being able to take anything any hum an has ever written, drawn, or im agined without
com pensation, it ought not exist, and we should not revise copyright law for such a purpose.
I do not believe that AI will becom e the profitable dream  that has been prom ised through the LLMs currently deployed, and to m y
knowledge, the existing m odels aren't anywhere close to becom e profitable, nor do they have use cases that m erit the enorm ous
investm ent, nor excusing allowing the taking of intellectual work by rem oving the protection of intellectual work. It's a bubble that will pop,
and sim ilar to how Tesla has repeatedly prom ised full self-driving soon, the prom ises of wonders and benefits are prom ised and
em broidered, and there is no m oral or com pelling econom ic reason to rem ove protection of law for the benefit of AI training.
