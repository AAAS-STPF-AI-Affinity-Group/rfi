General Comment
Generative AI should not have any place in the political or econom ic future of the United States. As it exists currently it will create m ore
issues than it solves. Even with "im provem ents" envisioned by those who cham pion it, it is a fundam entally m isunderstood and over-hyped
technology that will inevitably fall to the sam e innovation cesspit as NFTs.
