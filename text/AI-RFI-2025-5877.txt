General Comment
The purpose of copyright is to encourage the creation of new artistic and scholarly works. The current system  m ay be flawed, but the
protections it provides are crucial to the creation of new m usic, art, literature, and scholarship. Allowing com panies to steal the created
works for the sole purpose of m aking derivative works without com pensating creators will discourage potential authors from  creating new
works. Not only will those works be used to create derivatives and deny them  the opportunity for profiting from  their work, but it will
stifle their creativity by burying them  in a sea of lackluster, boring works. This will stifle the developm ent of new art and knowledge. 
Generative AI com panies have failed to dem onstrate any utility that justifies the m assive theft of intellectual property - they are not
prepared to create new works that are unique or accurate. These com panies create a deluge of garbage that they cannot even provide
attribution for. Down this road lies stagnation.
