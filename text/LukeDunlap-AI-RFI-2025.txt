AI is powerful but it is founded on abuse and manipulation. We have the power to see a world
infused with AI responsibly, but that is not yet the world we live in. We have to address theissues unchecked power over such technology presents. Artists, scientists, academics andwriters deserve better than to have their work stolen and regurgitated with no plan in place tocompensate them or regulate the
 people taking advantage of them. Technology has moved
faster than our institutions can properly react and adapt. Ubiquitous elements of Americanculture and daily life are being stripped of their meaning and agency. We must address theimpact these technologies have on people's livelihood. The most powerful companies in theworld want the government to take a back seat and allow them to do whatever they want toenrich themselves on the back of decades of hard human labor striving for a better world. Wecannot abandon people to the whims of the rich who only see AI as an excuse to extract valuefor shareholders. We cannot surrender our democracy or our security to the whims of AItrained by malicious actors. - Me, Luke Dunlap
