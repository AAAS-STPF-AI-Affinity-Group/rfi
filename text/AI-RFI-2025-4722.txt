General Comment
AI is not the m ove. It will fail harder and faster than anything hum an driven. Thinking that such predatory practices should be allowed and
protected is insanity. AI should not have a say in anything creative, as it is m erely a regurgitation of whatever vom it and vitriol som eone
pum ps into it. Do not trust autom ation in this field, not now, not ever.
