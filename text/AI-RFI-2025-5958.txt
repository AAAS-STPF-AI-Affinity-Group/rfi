General Comment
Further enabling open AI to steal the works of artists the world over is not going to im prove it. We do not need to pour m ore resources
into a technology that has been proven m ultiple tim es to be inefficient, broken, and easily m anipulated. What we need are stronger
restrictions to ease the dam ages of generative AIâ€™s inevitable collapse. Do not let these tech bros have even m ore power.
