General Comment
Please do not allow AI of any kind to freely steal copyrighted work. There are hundreds of thousands of artists, voice actors, artworks,
songs etc. that won't have a fighting chance if it's allowed. Som e m ay even stop using their talents just to escape it. Also, think about the
security concerns, how a video, an im age, or even a sound clip could be m ade of som eone that could ruin their lives using AI. Please, vote
against allowing AI to use/steal copyrighted works or anything else. Thank you.
