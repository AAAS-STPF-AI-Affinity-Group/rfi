General Comment
Artificial intelligence m ust be m ade to use the sam e rules for copying and deriving as all of the rest of us. A hum an would not be allowed to
freely create copies of another persons work and claim  it as their own, this should be true to AIs as well.
Allowing unrestricted access for AI com panies also poses a great risk to any and all capital that is generated for copyright holders as well.
This would m ean that any m edia could be re-created as an "ai copy" and redistributed for free, effectively legalizing piracy
