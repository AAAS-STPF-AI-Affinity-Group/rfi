General Comment
I do not believe Artificial Intelligence will contribute to a stronger Am erica. I work with software engineers as well as creatives in m y
industry, and have seen the technology fail in critical ways. AI is untrustworthy, and threatens to reduce creative work to generic slop. This
is not som ething we should take a risk on as a country, there are far m ore pressing issues to address.
