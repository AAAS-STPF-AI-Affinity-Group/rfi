General Comment
"...ensure that unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents do not ham per private sector AI innovation." 
The prim ary "Artificial Intelligence" uses I'm  fam iliar with at this tim e are the "generative AI" processes that produce nonsense text,
incorrect answers to com m on knowledge questions, and overly-glossy but fundam entally bad "art" im ages. These generative AI program s
use astronom ical am ounts of water and power that could be better spent in other areas of industry. Many of them  have also been "trained"
on copyrighted works, of which the copyright holders did not consent. (And despite all of that, the results are still bad! What are these
com panies even doing?)
If anything, I think AI needs MORE burdensom e requirem ents! I think AI com panies need to respect Am erican copyright law and
m anage their utilities and resources better! 
Stripping existing regulation or preventing new regulation will cause "AI" to develop into an even m ore useless, lazy, inefficient technology.
The requirem ents and regulations are the things that will drive innovation. The place to innovate is in efficiency and ethics.
