General Comment
As a content creator who m akes a living from  m y copyrighted work, the idea that Open AI can sim ply consum e m y work without any sort
of com pensation or even recognition is beyond the pale. If this is allowed, and copyright no longer has any relevance, then it is going to
negatively affect the incom es of a huge num ber of creatives while agglom erating power in the hands of people who already have too m uch
of it while continuing to decay the reasoning and thinking ability of entire generations of hum an beings.
