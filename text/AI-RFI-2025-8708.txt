General Comment
AI com panies should NOT have unfettered access to and use of copyrighted m aterial without the expressed consent of and without
providing com pensation to the m aterials' rightsholders.
All of these AI m odels are essentially m achines of m ass production, and in m ost cases are for-profit ventures. Profiting from  som eone
else's copyrighted m aterial without perm ission is blatantly theft.
