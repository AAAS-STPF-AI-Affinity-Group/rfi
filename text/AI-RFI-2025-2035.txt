General Comment
Don't use AI, especially for national security.
AI, especially as it exists currently, uses too m any resources like water for cooling system s - water we need for drinking. It burns entirely
too m uch energy, energy that could be used to power hom es and businesses.
AI also steals copyrighted works - prim ing AI for God knows how m any lawsuits. 
This pitch to incorporate AI into all facets of governm ent sounds like a plot from  the private sector to worm  its way into public services
and m ake things less efficient, not m ore. I understand that the tech sector in the private m arket is struggling, especially as it loses m ore
m arket share. But that's because they keep reinventing the wheel in less efficient ways. This idea to incorporate AI into the governm ent
sounds like an attem pt by the tech CEOs to save their com panies from  failing.
If that's the case, expect a 2008-like m arket crash.
Stop trying to save the tech sector from  their failings. Don't use their AI m odels, especially as they currently exist.
