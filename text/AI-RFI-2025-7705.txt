General Comment
If you found out the bakery was stealing flour from  the superm arket to bake its bread you'd send the cops down im m ediately, right?
Meanwhile, these people are com ing out like "if I'm  not allowed to steal other people's stuff m y business is unsustainable." 
What's even the point anym ore?
You m ake som ething and it just gets gobbled up by som e big m achine and they are just like lm ao I'm  not paying you for it. Insult to injury
they use it to m ake som ething which puts you out of business.
Might as well just stop m aking things. Seem s to be what a lot of people are thinking.
