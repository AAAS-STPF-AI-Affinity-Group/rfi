General Comment
I don’t believe that allowing AI m akers to disregard copyright is the answer to accelerating our technology beyond China’s. Deepseek is
as successful as it is because they focus on research and developm ent that m akes their tech fundam entally better. Feeding generative AI
m ore m aterial isn’t going to m ake its output m ore advanced, it’ll result in a stagnant and exploitative AI industry.
