General Comment
AI has no right to take from  artist and honest hardworking individuals that create without the use of AI. This will only further dim inish the
values of "self-preservation" and creativity that bring life and em otion into the nation and world.
I vote against the ability for AI to take what doesn't belong to it. I'm  com pletely against em powering the usage and advancem ents of AI.
