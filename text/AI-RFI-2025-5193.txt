General Comment
Generative AI has no place in the governm ent or any sensible corporation. It only steals the data from  other sources and regurgitates what
it thinks a user would like to hear, like an over glorified auto-com plete. The usage of AI has been shown to increase the strain on our
electric grid as a nation, waste precious natural resources to build, m aintain, and cool the servers in its use, and infringe on intellectual
properties across the board. If generative AI is allowed free reign in all fields, why should a private citizen then be penalized for the
download of a m ovie or m usic album ?
This is a poor use of governm ent resources to try and "save" a flailing business m odel that with or without this plan passing will find itself
bankrupt and obsolete soon enough, just like NFTs and Ponzi Schem es.
