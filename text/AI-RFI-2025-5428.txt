General Comment
As a concerned citizen, it seem s that AI is being used as a way to rem ove jobs in the creative sector of the nation and replace them  with
servers that consum e m ass am ounts of energy. This plan does nothing but cater to yet another Web 3 tech fad like NFTs and
cryptocurrency while putting m ore Am ericans out of jobs and not actually saving costs as com panies m ove from  paying for em ployees to
paying for licenses and/or increased power bills to use their AI system s. And the end result is getting regurgitated AI slop work m ade from
work from  real people fed to the network. AI can't create anything truly new, and fully investing in it only leads to an inbred situation
where AI work is fed to AI networks and nothing new is created.
Pushing AI like this only leads to a decline for artists and other creatives. This "AI" is just neural networks and not even true artificial
intelligence. AI should be a tool in the tool belt of people m aking works, not a replacem ent to the creative process entirely.
