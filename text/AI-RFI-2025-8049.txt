General Comment
Am erica does not need "AI dom inance." We shouldn't let these thieves sit there and tell us they need unrestricted access to all of our
intellectual property, all of our data, just to run a m achine that turns it into slurry and spits out hallucinatory "facts" and plagiarized
aggregate.
