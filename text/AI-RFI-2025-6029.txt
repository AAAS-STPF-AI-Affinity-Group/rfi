General Comment
There is no justifiable reason to allow private corporations the legal cover to steal other people's work for their own personal gain. If
com panies want to train their AI on other people's work they should com pensate those people for their work.
Furtherm ore, the benefits of AI are wildly exaggerated. The types of AI that show actual utility for specific tasks are trained on carefully
curated data sets and not everything that can possibly be found on the internet.
There is no value to the public in stealing people's work and filling the Internet with AI slop to the point the Internet becom es useless.
