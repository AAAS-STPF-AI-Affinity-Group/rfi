General Comment
My nam e is Heather-Ashley Boyer. I am  an Am erican citizen, a SAG-AFTRA actress, a film  producer, and an AI policy advocate based
in Los Angeles. Over the past five years, I have been closely following the developm ent and progression of AI, long before ChatGPT was
part of the public zeitgeist. During the Hollywood strikes of 2023, I addressed over 9,000 actors on the serious risks of AI and the very
real threat it poses to jobs across all industries. AI is fundam entally unprecedented in its nature and the top research labs are gunning to
have it be far m ore than just another tech tool. Experts who have developed it and are m ost qualified to speak on its true nature say it is
better com pared to a new species, as opposed to m erely another tech tool. This presents m ajor risks and threats to the survival of
hum ankind. 
Due to the inherent risks that com e with developing AI, we m ust treat this as we did nuclear weapons. An AI Action Plan needs to include
a CERN for AI as well an international agreem ent to lim it the developm ent of advanced AI including AGI, ASI (superhum an intelligence),
and provide whistleblower protections at the AI labs. 
I urge policym akers to listen to academ ic experts on this issue and not the com panies who stand to gain m assive am ounts of m oney, while
gam bling with the very survival of the hum an race.
Sincerely, 
Heather-Ashley Boyer
