General Comment
I am  concerned that failing to preserve and bolster copyright protections for individuals working in and around the arts would be
catastrophic. Our m ost vaunted and well-regarded tech com panies have been largely unable to establish a use case for AI without both
illicitly training the data on works of artists without their consent and using an enorm ous and frankly unsustainable am ount of energy. Even
in the best cases, scientists m ay able to use large language m odels to help them  parse large am ounts of inform ation, but a dedicated expert
is still required to interpret the output of the large language m odels to ensure that they’re not publishing nonsense m achine learning. AI only
seem s to useful in cases where there are strict guardrails around their output, and those largely do not exist within the arts outside of
copyright protections. Am erica’s greatest export is its culture, and dim inishing protection around the largely decentralized arts workforce
would further undercut Am erica’s position as a world leader.
