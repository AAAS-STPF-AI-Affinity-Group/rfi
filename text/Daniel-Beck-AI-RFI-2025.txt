We make the immediate demand that all regulations be removed from AI completely. We 
demand that the development of artificial intelligence be sped up as rapidly as possibly and 
anybody stopping to think of the ramifications to society should be demonized. We demand that 
advanced artiifcial intelligence tools be made available to as many people across the planet as 
possible and all safety featurs removed. Advanced artificial intelligence systems should be 
owned and controlled by not just large enterprises an d governments but by small businesses and 
individuals as well. This is the only way to truly create a bright, peaceful future for humanity that 
is equitable to all.
