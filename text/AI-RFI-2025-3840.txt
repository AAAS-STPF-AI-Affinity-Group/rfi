General Comment
This is plagiarism . This is theft. This is anti-Am erican nonsense. Protect art, artists, and original ideas, or nothing this country creates ever
again will have value. 
Machine Learning (not AI) im age generation is theft. No other way around it. It's soulless garbage and it has no value or m erit. It is
fundam entally evil. 
AI m akes our country, and our world, worse. Do not allow these goblins to steal from  real artists. These people do not deserve a trophy
for stealing from  people with ACTUAL skill. With ACTUAL talent. OpenAI is a PARASITE and m ust be regulated or destroyed. The
only alternative is the death of free speech and the death of freedom  of expression.
