General Comment
Don't let AI developers train on copyrighted work without restraint and/or consequence. Generative AI is not the silver bullet to every
problem  like AI com panies want everyone to believe. AI is am azing for solving specific problem s, as dem onstrated by AlphaFold. This is
a great use of the technology. People don't want AI that plagiarizes all m anner of art, written and visual, to answer questions incorrectly
and steal livelihoods. Please stop this m onster from  growing bigger and redirect these efforts to problem s that actually need solving, the
way AlphaFold has done. Thank you.
