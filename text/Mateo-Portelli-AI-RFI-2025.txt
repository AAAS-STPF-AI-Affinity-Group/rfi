Good day Mr. D’Souza, 
The United States has led the world in artificial intelligence innovation, not just because 
of our technological capabilities, but because of our commitment to fostering free enterprise, 
securing national interests, and maintaining strategic superiority in emerging domains. AI is now 
an integral part of global competition, influencing military strategy, economic stability, and 
national security. As the federal government moves to define an AI Action Plan under the 
direction of President Trump’s Executive Order on Removing Barriers to American 
Leadership in AI, I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the priority areas that will 
shape the future of AI in America. 
The choices made today will not only define U.S. AI leadership in the coming decade but 
will also set a global precedent for AI’s role in national security, economic independence, and 
ethical governance. A proactive, security-conscious, and innovation-driven AI Action Plan is not 
merely an advantage -- it is a necessity for safeguarding the future of American strength and 
leadership in an AI-dominated world. 
Therefore, the path forward must recognize AI as both an opportunity and a responsibility 
-- one that requires the United States to lead not only in innovation but also in cybersecurity, 
military applications, and responsible governance to prevent adversarial misuse. To this end, I 
offer three key recommendations for consideration: 1.AI for Cyber Defense and National Security
Artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming modern warfare and cybersecurity.
The United States must prioritize AI integration to maintain its strategic edge and protect 
national interests. As an incoming U.S. Army Cyber Warfare Officer, I recognize the critical 
importance of embedding AI into both defensive and offensive cyber operations. To this end, I 
propose the following priorities: 
●Strengthening AI-Driven Cyber Threat Detection: The complexity and volume of
cyber threats necessitate advanced AI solutions capable of real-time threat detection and

response. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has developed a 
Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence, aiming to enhance cybersecurity capabilities 
through AI adoption. This roadmap outlines efforts to promote beneficial uses of AI, 
ensure AI systems are secure, and deter malicious AI applications that could threaten 
critical infrastructure. ●Enhancing AI Wargaming for Cyber Personnel: Simulated environments powered by
AI are essential for training cyber personnel in real-time threat scenarios. The
Department of Defense has launched the Artificial Intelligence Rapid Capabilities Cell
to accelerate the adoption of advanced AI technologies. This initiative includes pilot
programs that apply generative AI models to both warfighting and enterprise
management, providing immersive training platforms for cyber operators.
●Expanding AI Research Collaborations Between the Department of Defense and
Private AI Firms: Public-private partnerships are vital for keeping national security
applications at the forefront of technological advancement. The DoD's Chief Digital and
Artificial Intelligence Office has initiated collaborations with private sector entities to
integrate cutting-edge AI solutions into defense operations. These partnerships aim to
leverage commercial innovation to enhance military capabilities, ensuring that the U.S.
maintains a competitive advantage in AI applications for national security.Bottom line: The United States must integrate AI-driven threat detection, immersive AI training 
for cyber personnel, and robust public-private AI research collaborations to enhance national 
security and protect critical infrastructure.

2.AI Policy Must Align with U.S. Strategic Interests
As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, it is imperative that U.S. AI policy not only
fosters innovation but also aligns seamlessly with national security objectives. While 
streamlining bureaucratic processes can accelerate technological advancements, a robust 
governance framework is essential to safeguard against potential threats posed by adversarial 
entities. To this end, the following measures are recommended: 
●Preventing Exploitation of U.S.-Developed AI Technologies: The global proliferation
of AI technologies necessitates stringent controls to prevent adversarial nations from
leveraging U.S. innovations for malicious purposes, such as cyber warfare or economic
manipulation. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence had
emphasized in its final report the urgency of protecting AI assets, noting that the U.S. is
not adequately prepared to defend or compete in the AI era, particularly against nations
like China that are rapidly advancing their AI capabilities. To mitigate these risks, the
U.S. must implement comprehensive export controls and safeguard intellectual property
to ensure that AI technologies do not fall into the hands of adversaries.●Establishing Security Compliance Standards in Critical Sectors: AI applications are
increasingly integrated into critical sectors, including defense, law enforcement, and
intelligence operations. To maintain national security, it is essential to develop and
enforce security compliance standards tailored to AI systems within these domains. The
previous administration’s National Security Memorandum on Artificial Intelligence ,
issued in October 2024, provided directives for federal agencies, aiming to ensure that AI
adoption enhances national security while adhering to safety and ethical standards.
Though the President revoked this memorandum last month, the need for standardized
evaluations and policies to test, understand, and mitigate risks associated with AI systems
before their deployment in sensitive areas is in no way reduced.●Addressing Risks of AI-Generated Misinformation and Deepfakes: The advent of
AI-generated content, particularly deepfakes, poses significant threats to national stability
by enabling the spread of misinformation and facilitating foreign influence campaigns.
The National Security Agency and other federal agencies have highlighted the
cybersecurity challenges presented by “synthetic media”, which can be used to
manipulate public opinion or undermine trust in institutions. To combat these threats, it is
crucial to develop advanced detection technologies, establish legal frameworks to deter
malicious use, and promote public awareness about the potential dangers of deepfakes.
Bottom line: Federal policy must implement stringent export controls, enforce security 
compliance in critical sectors, and combat AI-generated misinformation to prevent adversarial 
exploitation and safeguard democratic institutions.

3.AI for Economic and Workforce Development
Maintaining American leadership in AI necessitates a robust domestic workforce
proficient in AI-related disciplines, particularly in cybersecurity, defense applications, and AI 
law. Federal AI policy should focus on the following strategic areas: 
●Investing in AI Training for Military and Cybersecurity Personnel: Equipping
military and cybersecurity professionals with advanced AI skills is crucial for national
security. Initiatives like the Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence Talent Initiative
aim to recruit and train a world-class digital workforce by placing recent graduates in
federal agencies with cybersecurity needs, providing them with vital public sector
experience and leadership development opportunities. Additionally, educational
institutions are stepping up; for instance, Sam Houston State University has launched
SamPoly, offering online certificates and associate degrees in practical AI and intelligent
automation to address workforce shortages in Texas.●Supporting AI-Driven Domestic Manufacturing and Chip Production: Reducing
reliance on foreign supply chains for semiconductors is vital for AI advancement. The
CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 allocates substantial funding to boost domestic
semiconductor manufacturing. Building on this, the Building Chips in America Act of
2023 streamlines approvals for semiconductor projects by exempting them from certain
environmental reviews, expediting the establishment of manufacturing facilities. These
legislative efforts aim to enhance national security and supply chain resilience by
fostering a robust domestic semiconductor industry.●Encouraging AI Innovation with Security-Focused Safeguards: Promoting AI
innovation requires balancing technological advancement with the protection of
intellectual property. The previous Administration proposed a regulatory framework to
ensure the responsible diffusion of frontier AI technology globally, aiming to preserve
U.S. leadership in AI while safeguarding national security interests. This framework
sought to control the export of advanced AI chips and related technologies, preventing
adversarial nations from exploiting U.S. innovations for malicious purposes.
Bottom line: The Federal Government must invest in workforce development for cybersecurity 
and military personnel, strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing to reduce foreign 
dependency, and promote AI innovation while enforcing safeguards to protect national security 
and intellectual property.

As the United States moves forward in shaping its Artificial Intelligence Action Plan, the 
policies implemented today will define the nation's ability to secure its technological future, 
maintain strategic superiority, and defend against adversarial threats. AI is not merely an 
economic tool but a critical pillar of national security, military readiness, and economic 
resilience. By prioritizing AI-driven cybersecurity defenses, aligning AI governance with 
national security objectives, and ensuring robust workforce development, the U.S. can solidify its 
leadership in this rapidly evolving field. 
Furthermore, fostering public-private partnerships, safeguarding domestic AI innovation 
from foreign exploitation, and investing in domestic semiconductor production will not only 
strengthen American economic independence but also reinforce U.S. defense capabilities in 
cyberspace and beyond. These efforts must be pursued without compromising national security 
safeguards or allowing foreign adversaries to exploit American advancements in AI. 
With AI reshaping modern warfare, global competition, and critical infrastructure, the 
United States cannot afford to take a reactive approach. The AI Action Plan must be decisive, 
forward-looking, and unwavering in its commitment to strengthening national security, 
enhancing economic resilience, and empowering the next generation of AI professionals. I urge 
the National Science Foundation and relevant agencies to incorporate these recommendations 
and ensure that American AI policy reflects the urgency of this moment. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to further discussions on this 
topic and welcome any opportunities to contribute insights as the AI Action Plan takes shape. 
Yours respectfully, Mateo Portelli
