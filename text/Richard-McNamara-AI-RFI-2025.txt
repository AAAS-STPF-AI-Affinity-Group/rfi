The impact of AI on employment is indeterminable. To mitigate negative impacts, and more  
importantly to leverage benefits quickly, the major impediment to flexible response,  
regulation, needs to be addressed, specifically by elimination. 
Additionally, public funds should never be used to give competitive advantage, in a software  
development program, the Open Source model serves the need for fairness. The additional  
benefits of open source software are so obvious, and apparent, that listing them here is not  
required.
Open Source models will reassure the public that AI is not being used to manipulate  
individuals, or further enrich parasitic elites.
For America to lead any field, we must base our actions on the real competitive advantage of  
our Nation, that of course is our unique emphasis on Liberty and Freedom. 
The impediments to using these two core competencies are, regulation, taxation, and  
cronyism. 
No long term success can be achieved without making AI accessible to all, and free from  
censorship.
Thank you for listening to my recommendations.
