General Comment
I have no problem  with a technology that practices responsible actions and m ethods. If these com panies are openly given their training
date voluntarily, I again have no problem  with that.
However, to take the work of others, without their knowledge, consent or com pensation then to sell that product for profit will forever be
ethically, m orally, and legally wrong.
