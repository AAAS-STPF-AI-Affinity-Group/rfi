General Comment
Generative AI “innovation” has been built on the labor of m any thousands of creatives: artists, authors, photographers, poets, academ ics,
etc. The vast m ajority of us were never provided a m eans to opt-out and will not be com pensated for the unauthorized use of our work to
train AI system s. Generative AI directly com petes with the hum ans on whose work it depends for its output and has put m any creatives
out of work. As it stands, it’s already an unethical business m odel. Any relaxation of existing copyright laws would only com pound the
negative im pact on hum an artists and authors. True innovation in creative fields requires consciousness and heart, which are things AI
cannot provide.
In addition to the direct repercussions on hum an artists, the environm ental im pact of AI usage is not worth the m eager shortcuts it offers.
