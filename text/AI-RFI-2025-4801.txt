General Comment
I have already watched m ultiple friends and coworkers lose their em ploym ent due to generative AI tools and its m isuse as shortcuts to
avoid staff retention. Furtherm ore, m yself and other friends of m ine who survived these rounds of layoffs are forced to use AI in ways that
does not m ake sense for their workflow or com pany culture. This has had a net negative im pact on their productivity and m orale.
Everyone I know m isses their form er coworkers, com pany culture, and feels burdened with extra bisywork that m asquerades as skill and
expertise but offers none. AI is not unleashing the power of the m arket, it is sm othering it in confusion and pretense. Using the Federal
Governm ent to prop up the AI bubble only ensures that the inevitable burst will hurt m ore and last longer than if we let AI die its own
natural death due to public backlash and broken prom ises. AI should be reigned in, not propped up
