General Comment
I do not consent or approve of this. AI, when used judiciously in applications that m ake sense and do not threaten the livelihoods of our
people or steal creative works from  our artists, can be beneficial, but it is an entirely unregulated and unfettered thing. As som eone who is
fam iliar with AI, this is extrem ely dangerous and there are no upsides. You can only m ean to wield it as a weapon against the Am erican
people.
