-- I hate AI and I don't want it
-- I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US-- AI steals from my livelihood as an American and profits off of theft-- AI is overhyped and is fleecing the American public / AI is a
speculative market similar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with falsepromises to fool the public and huge legal problems by enabling them
-- AI has huge data security concerns-- AI makes products look cheaply made and discourages people from
those products
