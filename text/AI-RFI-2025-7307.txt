General Comment
The current Large Language Models that are currently being sold as Artificial Intelligence are are a failed invention. These tools regularly
m akes errors and produce bad inform ation, requiring an expert to edit anything m ade with the them . In their best use case, LLMs can only
function as a clum sy, stupid assistant, perform ing only the m ost basic of tasks or awkwardly sum m arizing inform ation while m issing any
context. Even if these tools were able to perform  the tasks they are being sold for, the creation of LLMs requires using the intellectual
property of hum an people. Without the consent of the people, LLMs can only work through the theft of intellectual property. Please do
not prioritize the rights of m achines over the rights of people. Please do not m ake theft legal.
