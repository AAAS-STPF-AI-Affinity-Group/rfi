General Comment
As a veteran educator with over twenty years of classroom  experience, I believe that AI should have guardrails and lim itations. 
Scraping or the free use of copyrighted m aterial should be prohibited. The theft of intellectual property hurts Am ericans. 
The use of AI for independent student assignm ents in education should be regulated.
The adverse environm ental im pacts need to be curtailed with its usage, specifically with water usage and electrical grids that support AI
processing.
It's a m istake to rescind the guardrails placed on AI for the profit of large corporations. It will ultim ately hurt everyday Am ericans in the
ways expressed above.
