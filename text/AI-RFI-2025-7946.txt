General Comment
I don’t do any work in art at all but I am  100% against AI. I will not buy or partake in anything involving AI. If any websites start using it,
I will delete m y account. To m e, it seem s very overhyped anyway. I have not seen it do anything good at all. The “art” it m akes is
unappealing. The voices it m akes never sound hum an. It always looks and sounds off. When it writes stuff it never sounds good. It is
overhyped. So on top of just not being really good at anything, it steals from  actual hum an’s work. I would rather give jobs to hum ans
who can actually do a good job.
