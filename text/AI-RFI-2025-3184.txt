General Comment
This CANNOT com e to pass. This would harm  so m any people, artists, people who enjoy art and creations, and m ore. Google, and
these other big corporations such as it, are m ore than capable of actually hiring and paying som eone to illustrate and/or com e up with their
own new creative ideas instead of stealing and robbing individuals who they did not pay or hire or give any sort of com pensation for.
Com panies supporting generative AI need to stop trying to build their product upon theft especially if they are wanting it to be the "future".
This is stom ping on the bodies off hundreds of thousands and m illions of citizens who bring art and creation, HUMAN CREATIONS, to
life and bring enjoym ent in this world while trying to get enough personal revenue just to afford their next m eal. Most products that you use
today had to be invented by a real hum an, and they sure were not invented by som e slopy software that turns REAL creativity into
generated recycled Frankensteined slop. Just hire staff to do this work as it costs m uch less than the power grid needed to run this shady
software and hardware nightm are.
