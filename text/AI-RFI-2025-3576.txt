General Comment
The Am erican people do not want this. We, hum an creators of academ ic and creative prose, do not want this. I, a published author, do
not want a poorly designed algorithm  to be given access to and trained on words that I worked hard to put together to create logical,
convincing argum ents so that it can produce likely-sounding garbage that is devoid of sense sim ply because the U.S. governm ent has
invested so m uch m oney into this project already that it cannot adm it that the "AI" project as it currently exists is a waste and a failure.
Copyright and the way that it lim its the "OpenAI" project should be MAINTAINED.
