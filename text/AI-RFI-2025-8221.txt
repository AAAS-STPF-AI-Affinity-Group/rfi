General Comment
Just hoping the politicians voting yes on this are okay with AI-created deepfakes of their voices, faces, and bodies being shared on the
internet. I m ean, if it's not out there already. Try explaining to your fam ily, friends, and constituents that the com prom ising video of you is
com puter generated and not real.
