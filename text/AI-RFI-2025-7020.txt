General Comment
Letting this happen opens up the issue of art being som ething that cannot be defended, and m ore im portantly, that som eone's idea and
hard work m eans nothing.
More im portantly for corporations (since that is all that m atters in our politics), it m eans that unique ideas and licenses could, in the future,
also not be able to be copyright protected. The idea of this is m oving the goalpost further and further to defend copyright, and eventually,
copyright won't m ean anything anym ore.
