General Comment
A.I. is nothing m ore than a content theft m achine that hurts sm all artists who don’t have the financial m eans to take com panies that use it to
court. This is a dem ocracy, not a m onarchy! Follow the god dam n rulings the judicial branch issued. Rem em ber, that killer who got real
close to saving this country last year was one of your supporters. It ain’t the Left you should be scared of, it’s the Frankenstein’s m onster
that you created.
