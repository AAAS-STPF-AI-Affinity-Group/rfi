General Comment
To whom  it m ay concern,
Generative AI and com puter learning m odels are fascinating technologies with m ultiple applications that could benefit the United States.
However, I think the technology should be handled in a safe and ethical m anner. To m e this m eans a few things:
- All training data should be owned or licensed by the creators of the learning m odel. The use of unlicensed data should not be allowed.
- The use of data and works as training data should not be considered under the "fair use" exception to copyright law.
- The use of personal data should always be opt-in, not opt-out. Changes to licenses on websites and software to retroactively attem pt to
license user's data for use as training data should not be allowed.
- The use of AI outputs without hum an review in governm ent and business decision m aking (such as hiring decisions, m edical claim
rejections, applications for governm ent grants, etc) should be disallowed.
Thank you for considering m y response.
