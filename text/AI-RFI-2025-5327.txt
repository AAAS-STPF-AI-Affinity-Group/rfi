General Comment
Quite frankly, I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. All it does is steal from  artists & creatives, m ass their ideas and
concepts, and com e out with nonsensical m uddled up content. It m akes no sense for the governm ent to let AI have free reign when it will
only m uddy the waters of actual inform ation and the m isinform ation that a ton of AI chat bots and search engines do.
