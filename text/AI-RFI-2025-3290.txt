General Comment
AI is nothing m ore than a plagiarism  m achine. It doesn’t m ake anything better or easier, and it’s terrible for the environm ent to boot.
Please don’t allow these vultures free access to the art and writing so m any prim e have worked so hard to create so they can m ake
billions producing cheap copies with no com pensatory obligations.
