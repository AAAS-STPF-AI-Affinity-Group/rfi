General Comment
You are asking for the perm ission to m ake copyright infringem ent legal. You are asking for the right to steal from  hardworking artists and
writers, and to take m oney from  their hands and food from  their m ouths. You are wanting to allow a soulless, lifeless m athem atic equation
to replace hum an beings who live to create.
A nation that allows these actions is a nation that will no longer dream , no longer create, and no longer hope. Soon after that, it will
becom e a nation that no longer exists.
As a writer, I im plore you to stop heading down this road of self-eradication. Art is purely and utterly and ultim ately hum an. It cannot be
reproduced by, or replaced by AI.
