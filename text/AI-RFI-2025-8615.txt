General Comment
The endorsem ent of Generative AI and support of it's use in creative, academ ic, or adm inistrative environm ents is guaranteed to lead to
eroded accountability and credibility in these fields. 
Generative AI in creative fields requires the use of a m odel trained on copyrighted works without the approval of the owner of these
copyrights. These include sm all creatives, ranging from  various artist and writers, m usicians and voice actors, to large com panies such as
Walt Disney, Dream works, or Warner. Granting protections to Generative AI firm s will prevent these parties from  protecting their
intellectual property rights from  being used in a m alicious m anner. 
As a creative in a sm aller sense, I ask that you oppose this order to protect the rights of those that wish to create art, rather than those
who wish to use that art to create an am algam ation of stolen works into a piece of work with no hum an spark behind its creation.
