General Comment
The disregard of Copyright by the various AI com panies has already harm ed the various Am erican artists and businesses who rely on
Copyright for their incom e, and granting AI com panies a fair use exem ption will only m ake the problem  worse. Not only is it bad for the
econom y, but it is ultim ately self defeating, as there will be fewer copyrighted works for the AI com panies to use as training data if it
becom es less econom ically viable for those works to be created.
It is of utm ost im portance that AI com panies properly license any copyrighted work their algorithm s ingest, so that they don't destroy the
industries that they rely on to exist in the first place. If an average individual was discovered to have been pirating works the way the AI
com panies have been, they'd alm ost certainly be crim inally processed.
