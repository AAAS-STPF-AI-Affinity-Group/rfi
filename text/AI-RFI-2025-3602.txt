General Comment
AI is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and benefit the very few and its
environm ental costs far outweigh any potential benefit. 
As an artist and inform ation professional, I am  concerned with the theft of intellectual property, infringem ent of copyright, as well as data
accuracy and security.
