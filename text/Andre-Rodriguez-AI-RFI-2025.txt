Given the fundamental limits to generative AI's capabilities and viable use cases, there is
literally no benefit to be had from implementing legal protections for AI outside of the short-term financial gain for companies to wring from investors who have been intentionally misledby those companies as to what the technology does and how it works.
 Any lawmaker who
grants generative AI legal rights not just matching, but beyond those granted to a humanworker categorically does not have the interests of those working constituents in mind, andwill be recognized thusly come next election season.
