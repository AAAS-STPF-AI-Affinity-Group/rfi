General Comment
I oppose generative AI for m any reasons, including its environm ental im pacts (it takes huge am ounts of water and electricity to run), the
exploitation of labor that has gone into what little content m oderation there is (from  prison labor in Finland to extrem ely low-wage work in
various African countries), and, m ost im portantly for this particular conversation, the fact that Large Language Models are a form  of
plagiarism , as they steal the words and intellectual labor from  hum an creatives without credit, perm ission, or com pensation. Generative AI
is wasting energy, harm ing the environm ent, ripping off hum an artists and writers, spitting out incorrect inform ation left and right, and
tem pting students to cheat instead of learn. We need m ore guardrails and less generative AI.
