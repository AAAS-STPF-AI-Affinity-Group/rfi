General Comment
Art is so im portant to m e because it is one of the few ways I'm  able to truly show m y inner thoughts in physical form , AI art is m ade
alm ost exclusively out of stolen art, stolen dream s, and stolen inner thoughts
Hum an Art is the m ost im portant to m e to see, all the im perfections, all the sketchy lines and asym m etry shows the artist behind it, AI art
takes all of that away, it takes the passion and love and em otion and grinds it into algorithm s and num bers
Al art is not art
There are m any things I could say, but you cannot autom ate art like you can autom ate other tasks 
Art is not som ething that can be m anufactured in a factory. Itâ€™s som ething that has to be handm ade. Art is som ething that we hum ans have
been doing for years since the tim e of the woolly m am m oths roam ing our earth we have been doing artwork, and drawing the creatures
that we seen or how we feel about them , art now is the sam e as it was all those years ago 
art evolves with us it cannot evolve with AI without artists that AI is useless it will becom e eventually a garbled m ess feeding off of itself
becom ing worse, it needs to feed off of stolen artwork m ade by artist who are trying their hardest to express and show what they wanna
show in the world.
Al Art can never replace a hum an because art is a hum an thing
