General Comment
AI does nothing but steal from  hum ans to m ake a bastardized version of "art" that is insulting to the nature of hum anity. No "ai race" is
worth putting at risk thousands of years of shared hum an knowledge and experience and expression. Protect art, artists, and the hum an
soul. If you do not believe in this, think of it sim ply as unauthorized theft of intellectual property, which it is. As an artist m yself, even a
hobbyist, I want to know I can share m y works with others without fear of a m achine taking from  m e without m y consent. You are
stealing pieces of artists as well as their possible incom e source. Artists should be supported and encouraged, and NEVER replaced with
m achinery in any way. Anericans and qll of hum anity deserve real art from  real life storytellers. To deprive us of this and our liberty to
create works without fear of corporations poaching it for m oney is evil and unforgivable.
