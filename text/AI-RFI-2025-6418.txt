General Comment
AI sucks and is a drain on the m odern copyright system . If we allow com panies such as OpenAI to freely trawl through the sum  total of
hum an creation, exploiting it to their own benefit & ultim ately profit, what better is that than theft? Copyright laws apply to everyone else
and every other com pany, why should it not apply to them ?
