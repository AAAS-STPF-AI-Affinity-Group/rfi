General Comment
Any AI policy and law needs to acknowledge and respect the creators of the data used in training m odels or generating content. Artists,
writers, program m ers, etc. need protection for their efforts and com pensation for its use. If any AI com pany or project cannot succeed
without unlim ited free access to copyrighted m aterial, that com pany or project does not deserve to succeed.
We cannot afford to create a system  that strongly disincentivizes creatives from  producing the very content necessary for a generative AI
system  to even be possible.
