Frankly, I am fearful of a huge AI presence in the world. While it can have its uses, it can also be 
used by those seeking to control/influence people and world impacting events. Even if 
regulations are put in place, there are unscrupulous people/organizat ions/corporations that would 
secretly defy them. Please move with extreme caution.
