Report on AI Weaponization and Digital Harassment
To: President Donald J. TrumpSubject: The Weaponization of Artificial Intelligence and Its Impact on Civil LibertiesIntroductionI appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the development and use of artificial
intelligence (AI). My experiences with AI over the past nine years have been deeplytroubling. I have faced relentless harassment, de-platforming, and digital suppression,all of which I believe stem from the weaponization of AI against individuals who engagein investigating and discussing controversial topics related to government andcorporate corruption.
Despite executive orders aimed at preventing the misuse of AI, these orders have not
been enforced. Instead, AI-based systems continue to be used in ways that harmindividuals—physically, emotionally, financially, and mentally. The following reportoutlines my experiences and observations regarding AI’s role in censorship,harassment, and social engineering.
AI Censorship and Digital Suppression
•I have been de-platformed, shadow-banned, and denied the ability to make
comments or payments across multiple digital platforms.
•Alternative media sources are targeted, with users being unsubscribed without
consent and engagement metrics (likes/dislikes) manipulated to suppress dissenting
voices.
•The misuse of AI-driven moderation and censorship tools has silenced many
individuals since October 2017, effectively erasing them from public discourse.


AI-Driven Harassment and Behavioral Manipulation
•I have been subjected to AI-generated text messaging campaigns, receiving
600 to 800 messages per month from unverifiable sources claiming to be government
representatives or veterans.
•These AI-generated messages do not obey “STOP” requests and continuously
generate new numbers, effectively overwhelming the victim and disrupting personalcommunications.
•AI is being used to socially engineer emotions, induce stress, and modify
behavior, a tactic resembling psychological warfare.
•The sound notifications triggered by these messages can be used as a form of
digital torture, reinforcing emotional manipulation techniques.
Corporate and Government Complicity in AI Misuse
•Large corporations, including Verizon and Google, are complicit in using AI-
driven customer service mechanisms that obstruct real human communication.
•AI chat systems and push-button phone menus are designed to limit users to
predefined choices, making it nearly impossible to resolve issues effectively.
•Many service providers now rely on AI to manage customer interactions, often
employing offshore call centers where representatives lack the authority to resolve
concerns.
AI’s Role in Radicalization and Social Engineering
•AI can analyze a person’s online activity and biometric data to create a “pattern
of life,” which can be used for various manipulative purposes.
•AI-driven systems can be programmed to seek out and target individuals based
on specific views, effectively isolating and harassing them through digital means.
•This technology is capable of aggravating emotions and provoking violent
responses, raising concerns about its potential role in radicalization efforts.
•Hollywood and the music industry have played a role in normalizing AI-driven
behavioral conditioning, further embedding this technology into everyday life.Cybersecurity and AI as a Digital Weapon
•The weaponization of AI is a growing threat, as evidenced by the Microsoft
“Tay” chatbot incident, where malicious actors manipulated AI to exhibit harmful
behaviors.
•AI is being used for cyberattacks, data poisoning, and social engineering at an
unprecedented scale.
•Research on AI weaponization highlights its potential to automate and scale
digital threats, making mitigation strategies essential for protecting digitalinfrastructure.
Proposed Solutions and Recommendations
1.Strengthening AI Oversight and Regulation:
•Enforce existing executive orders to prevent AI weaponization against
individuals.
•Establish independent oversight committees to monitor AI-driven censorship
and harassment.


2.Enhancing Digital Consumer Protections:
•Require corporations to maintain direct human communication options for
customer support.
•Prohibit AI-driven manipulation of engagement metrics and online discourse.
3.Developing a Global AI Monitoring System:
•The FBI and international law enforcement agencies should create an AI-driven
investigative system.
•This system would allow individuals experiencing digital harassment, hacking,
or scamming to report incidents directly to local authorities.
•Such an initiative would require global cooperation but would be instrumental in
curbing AI-driven digital abuse.
4.Public Awareness and AI Ethics:
•Promote AI transparency and require companies to disclose when AI is being
used in public-facing interactions.
•Educate consumers on how AI-driven social engineering tactics function and
how t o protect themselves.
Conclusion
Artificial intelli gence, w hen properl y desi gned and regulat ed, can be a powerful tool for 
innovation and progress . Howeve r, when weaponized , it becomes a means of 
censorship , harassment , and behaviora l contr ol. The unchecked us e of AI has resulted 
in significant  harm to individuals lik e mysel f, who hav e been targeted f or their views and 
investigativ e work.
Government agencies and corporations must b e held accountab le for their r ole in AI 
weaponization. Stronger regulatory frameworks, consumer protections, and 
investigativ e mechanisms ar e necessar y to ensur e AI serves t he people rat her than 
controls them.
I urge immediate action to address these concerns before AI-driven oppression 
becomes an irreversible part of societ y.
