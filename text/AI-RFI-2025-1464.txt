General Comment
Copyright law is not unnecessary and burdensom e. Officially legalizing AI training by scraping the internet and targeting artists work
blatantly disregards ownership of creative work and businesses. There is plenty of legal room  to work with copyright holders to pay for
licenses to train AI, should the individual or copyright holder agree. But giving it away for free is insulting and illegal.
