General Comment
A Fascist society oppresses its artists, by allowing AI to take the art away from  these people with heart, you are allowing artists to be
oppressed, And take away what few passions that people can have. The content produced by AI is from  stolen content, stealing from  the
people m aking content, us oppressing them . If AI is perm itted to get away with that, the art of society will be passionless and dull.
