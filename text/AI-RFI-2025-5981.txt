General Comment
Personally, I think it's pretty disgusting that the governm ent thinks it's OK to just sign over the intellectual property of every hum an being
ever. I think that's the sort of thing that is deeply, deeply im m oral and illegal, and that AI com panies should be accountable just like
everyone else for theft.
