General Comment
Actual innovation com es from  hum an beings. The ram pant and unregulated use of generative artificial intelligence scrapes am d steals the
intellectual property of m illions. Why would anyone feel com pelled to put discoveries, inventions, or art into the world if they know their
work will be stolen without com pensation? "Dom inance" in AI is dom inance in folly.
