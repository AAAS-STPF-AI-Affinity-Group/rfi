RE: U.S. AI Action  Plan Request  for Information  
 
Dear  Mr. Dohne:  
 
The General  Catalyst  Institute  (GCI)  is pleased  to submit  these  comments  on the 
development  of President  Trump’ s forthcoming  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) Action  Plan.   
 
General  Catalyst  is a global  investment  and transformation  company  with over $32B  in 
assets  under  management  that partners  with the world’ s most  ambitious  entrepreneurs  to 
drive  resilience  and applied  AI. Since  our founding  25 years  ago, we have  invested  in over 
800+  start-ups.  As such,  our comments  focus  on what  would  enable  the startup  ecosystem  
to thrive  and grow . Effective  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) policy  in this country  will be key to that 
growth  and to remaining  competitive  on a global  stage.   
 
In September  2024,  we launched  GCI with a mission  to promote  and strengthen  national  
resilience  around  the world  by backing  transformative  technologies  and shaping  public  
policies  that improve  society . The Institute  operates  as a platform  for collaboration  and 
partnership  between  entrepreneurs,  government,  investors,  experts,  and academics  to help 
shape  informed  policy  solutions.  GCI’s top priority  is cultivating  a healthy  ecosystem  for 
entrepreneurship  and serving  as a trusted  partner  to the global  policymaking  community  on 
how to respond,  leverage,  and adopt  cutting-edge  technology , such  as “applied  AI.”      
 
President  Trump  has demonstrated  his commitment  — and that of his administration  — to 
strengthening  American  leadership  in the global  AI race in a variety  of ways  including  
prioritizing  the appointment  of the first ever White  House  AI Czar  in David  Sacks,  and

nominating  and appointing  many  qualified  individuals  to shape  and implement  his 
administration’ s policies  across  this important  topic  such  as Michael  Kratsios  and Jacob  
Helberg.   
 
AI is transforming  how technology  delivers  value—expanding  what’ s possible  for 
ecosystems  globally . We are facing  a new power  competition  that requires  us to modernize  
and make  our critical  industries–healthcare,  defense  and intelligence,  industrial  and 
manufacturing,  financial  services  and energy–more  resilient.  To keep  the world  safer , 
healthier , more  sustainable,  and productive  it will require  greater  capital,  patience,  and 
collaboration  across  all stakeholders,  on a scale  never  before  seen.   
 
Applied  AI refers  to the practical  implementation  of artificial  intelligence  techniques  and 
technologies  to solve  real-world  problems.  Unlike  theoretical  AI — which  disproportionately  
focuses  on understanding  the underlying  technological  models  and computational  realities  
— applied  AI is about  using  frontier  technology  in practical  applications  across  various  
industries.  
Examples  of applied  AI include:  
1. Healthcare:  AI can be used  to analyze  medical  data,  help with diagnostic  tools,  predict  
disease  outbreaks,  and personalize  treatment  plans.  
 
2. Finance:  AI is applied  in fraud  detection,  algorithmic  trading,  customer  service  through  
chatbots,  and risk assessment.  
 
3. Manufacturing:  AI can enhance  predictive  maintenance,  process  automation,  and 
quality  control.  
 
4. Defense  Tech: AI can process  data from cameras,  radar , and sensors  to detect  and 
track  targets  — whether  they are moving  vehicles,  personnel,  or other  objects.  The AI 
system  can make  quick  decisions  about  whether  a target  poses  a risk, assisting  
operators  in making  informed  decisions  during  combat  or military  operations.  
 
5. Cybersecurity:  AI also plays  a key role in cybersecurity . It has immense  power  to 
identify  and mitigate  potential  cyber  threats  faster  than existing  methods.  Applied  AI 
technologies,  like machine  learning  and predictive  analytics,  are used  to detect  patterns  
of cyberattacks,  offering  proactive  defense  against  sophisticated  threats.

Where  AI Stands  Today  
As we think  about  the current  state  of technology  policy  related  to AI and where  it should  go 
from here,  we believe  it is important  to understand  the state  of play in the marketplace.  
General  Catalyst’ s CEO  & Managing  Director  Hemant  Taneja  recently  authored  a framing  of 
where  Applied  AI stands  today , excerpts  of which  are included  below:   
 
We’re at a point  where  AI has reached  escape  velocity  as the essential  ingredients  - data,  
algorithms,  compute,  talent,  capital,  and market  demand  - are all present.  Generative  AI is 
now used  by 65% of companies,  a dramatic  increase  from just 33% in 2023.  As AI redefines  
value  creation  and capture,  it is projected  to add nearly  $20 trillion  annually  to the global  
economy  by 2030.   
 
GC’s 800+  portfolio  companies  enable  us to understand  that for founders,  this represents  an 
unprecedented  opportunity  to create  category-defining  companies  that empower  businesses  
to harness  the potential  of AI. Applied  AI offers  a path to building  resilient  companies  that 
endure  in this new era and we think  there  are three  characteristics  that can inform  thinking  
about  the future  of this cross-cutting  capability:  (1) Intelligence  capabilities  (developing  
trustworthy  models  that solve  real business  problems);  (2) Infrastructure  development  
(creating  secure,  scalable  systems  that enable  enterprise-wide  adoption);  and (3)  
Workforce  enablement  (scaling  services  with AI agents  and reshoring).   
 
As enterprises  move  from experimenting  with AI to deploying  it at scale,  the quality  and 
trustworthiness  of models  have  become  critical  differentiators.  Organizations  need  solutions  
that can be trusted  with sensitive  data,  adapted  to specific  industry  and business  needs,  and 
deployed  responsibly . 
 
While  powerful  models  are essential,  they are just the first step in enterprise  transformation.  
Creating  lasting  value  with AI requires  thoughtful  infrastructure  design  that can support  
these  models  at scale.  Leading  AI companies  excel  in three  key areas  of infrastructure:  
protecting  sensitive  information,  unifying  fragmented  enterprise  data to enable  better  
decisions,  and building  collaborative  frameworks  that ensure  adoption.  
 
With intelligence  capabilities  and infrastructure  in place,  the ultimate  measure  of AI’s impact  
lies in how it transforms  the way people  work,  and the work  itself.  Rather  than simply  
augmenting  existing  tasks,  AI allows  us to rethink  the nature  of work.  This shift is creating

new opportunities  to boost  productivity , enhance  job satisfaction,  and deliver  better  
outcomes  for businesses  and their employees.  
 
Advancing  AI solutions  are transforming  work  beyond  simple  automation,  addressing  labor  
shortages  and evolving  employee  roles.  For example,  AI systems  for healthcare  are already  
increasing  the supply  and scalability  of providers  while  reducing  the unit cost of care.  The 
adoption  of intelligent  AI agents  allows  humans  to focus  on work  that requires  creativity , 
emotional  intelligence,  and complex  decision-making.  As this trend  continues,  managing  AI 
agents  will likely  become  a new function,  or part of an expanded  role.  
 
The most  enduring  AI companies  prioritize  ecosystem  integration  from the outset.  Instead  of 
immediately  disrupting  entire  industries,  they identify  areas  where  AI can deliver  rapid  value  
and expand  from those  initial  wins.  This approach  requires  collaboration  across  traditional  
boundaries—  industries,  startups  and established  players,  and the public  and private  
sectors.   
 
This ecosystem  approach  is crucial  for realizing  the full potential  of applied  AI. By bringing  
together  different  perspectives  and expertise,  we can accelerate  solutions  that solve  
real-world  challenges  and create  companies  that endure.  We encourage  founders  to 
embrace  a new era of value  creation,  one where  collaboration  is paramount.  By focusing  on 
the three  levers  of enterprise  transformation—intelligence  capabilities,  infrastructure  
development,  and workforce  modernization—founders  can build  companies  that redefine  
industries,  and shape  the global  economy .  
 
For decades,  the government  has played  a role in innovating  the foundations  of computers,  
the Internet,  data storage,  and more.  But when  it comes  to commercialization  and consumer  
deployment,  innovation  does  not wait around  for regulatory  frameworks  to be built.   
 
Recommendations  
At a macro  level,  it is critical  for the US to have  a “whole-of-government”  approach,  with 
greater  coordination  across  agencies.  We must  ensure  consistency  and clarity  for the 
private  sector  — and the public.  US states  considered  almost  700 legislative  proposals  
related  to artificial  intelligence  (AI) in 2024  covering  a range  of issues.1 Forty-five  states  took 
up AI-related  legislation  this year, and just under  20 percent  of those  bills were  ultimately  
enacted  into law.2 Many  technology  policy experts  believe  that the pace  of new AI bills at the

state  level will continue  to increase  in 2025.  Given  this ongoing  challenge,  it is imperative  for 
the federal  government  to work  closely  with the private  sector  to tackle  this momentous  
challenge  and embrace  a level of coordination  that is without  modern  precedent.   
 
The following  recommendations  align  with the White  House’ s Office of Science  & 
Technology  Policy  call for input  across  these  key categories:   
 
Open  Source  Development:  
● Policies  should  promote,  protect,  and reward  open-source  (not just open-weights)  
AI models,  tools,  frameworks,  and resources  to foster  collaboration,  transparency , 
and a more  diverse  and resilient  AI ecosystem.  Open  source  AI development  
encourages  a competitive  marketplace,  promotes  entrepreneurship,  and enables  
research  and innovation.   
 
● The government  should  expand  incentives  and grants  for maintaining  core AI 
open-source  projects  to ensure  they remain  robust  and well-supported.   
 
● Open  source  encourages  collaboration  and innovation.  When  the source  code  is 
available,  researchers  and developers  can build  upon  each  other ’s work,  red team  
to improve  its resilience,  and accelerate  advancements  and create  more  robust  
solutions.  
 
● Open  source  projects  can reduce  costs  for startups  both in development  and 
deployment,  making  advanced  technologies  more  accessible  to various  
stakeholders,  including  smaller  organizations  and startups.   
 
● On the education  front,  these  models  can serve  as valuable  tools,  allowing  students  
and researchers  to explore  and experiment  with cutting-edge  technology  without  
the need  for proprietary  resources.  Open  source  models  allow  for greater  scrutiny  
and understanding  of how these  systems  work,  which  can build  public  trust and 
ensure  that the models  are used  ethically .  
 
● Any regulatory  guidelines  should  be restricted  to high-risk  applications  in areas  
such  as defense,  intel,  healthcare,  criminal  justice,  and critical  infrastructure  — 
where  the potential  for harm  is greatest.  Responsible  disclosure  of issues  and 
maintaining  robust  community  guidelines  is essential.  Bad actors  will try to take

advantage  of these  tools,  and a close  public  and private  sector  feedback  loop is 
essential  to convey  challenges  and potential  threats  that might  arise.  
 
National  Security  and Defense:   
● AI supply  chain  security  and protections  against  corporate  espionage  are critical.  
Federal  evaluations  of model  safety  should  be expanded.  
 
Research  and Development:   
● Increase  federal  support  for foundational  AI research,  especially  in areas  focused  on 
applied  AI.  
 
● Further  expand  AI benchmarking  and evaluation  initiatives  (including  domain-specific  
benchmarks)  to enable  better  assessment  of model  capabilities  and performance.   
 
● Encourage  joint initiatives  between  government  labs,  academia,  and industry  
(including  startups  and small  businesses).   
 
Energy  Consumption  and Efficiency:  
● Promote  and build  a strategic  national  framework  to harness  the intersection  of AI 
and energy  consumption.  Encourage  tax incentives  for companies  that help with a 
short,  medium,  and long-range  plan for new energy  sources  like SMRs,  fusion,  and 
other  alternative  sources.  Encourage  collaboration  between  tech companies,  energy  
providers,  and policymakers.  We will need  it all.  
 
● In order  for the U.S. to continue  to lead in AI, there  must  be a comprehensive  
“all-of-the-above”  energy  strategy  that pairs  robust  fiber networks  with abundant  data 
center  capacity . We must  build  competitive  and resilient  electricity  markets  through  
strategic  investments  and diversified  energy  sources.  In order  to accomplish  this, we 
must  accelerate  permitting  processes  for next-generation  power  infrastructure,  
transmission  systems,  and digital  infrastructure.  
 
Education  and Workforce:   
● The government  should  invest  more  in education  and training  programs  to develop  a 
workforce  skilled  in AI technologies  and ethical  considerations.  To accomplish  this, 
the government  can partner  with local community  colleges  and trade  schools  to 
integrate  AI into the existing  curriculum.

●Encourage more funding in AI Centers of Excellence across the US where
academic/research centers can provide opportunities for private-public sector
collaboration and to identify benefits of AI for healthcare, education, climate/energy,
etc.
Liability Protections: 
●Ensure legal structures that limit liability for startups using generative AI, especially
during the early experimental phases.
●Introduce safe harbor provisions for startups that adhere to established guidelines,
protecting them from certain liabilities in case of unintentional harm.
●Promote the development of tailored insurance products for generative AI risks,
making it easier for startups to obtain coverage.
Federal Framework 
●A federal, whole-of-government AI policy that sets a national standard and preempts
state laws is essential to prevent a fragmented patchwork of state regulations that
would create compliance burdens, especially for startups with limited resources. A
unified approach ensures clarity, fosters innovation, and maintains America's global
leadership in AI.
Summary  
At General Catalyst, we see the practical reality of the need for a thoughtful and flexible 
regulatory approach when it comes to AI — empowering transformation to thrive to benefit 
the quality of life for all people, while at the same time taking reasonable measures to limit 
the ability of bad actors to use these tools for nefarious purposes. We encourage the Trump 
Administration to continue doing all it can to strike a balance between innovation and 
security, while ensuring America remains one of the best places in the world for startups to 
build and thrive.
