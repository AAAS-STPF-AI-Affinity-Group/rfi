General Comment
Did you know that AI steals from  the livelihood of creatives in a variety of fields â€” graphic designers, anim ators, m ovie producers,
authors and historians, and m ore? It poisons the internet with false inform ation and reduces the education and literacy levels of Am ericans;
and it sets the stage for m alicious individuals to spread illegal and im m oral content such as fabricated pornography.
Of course, there should be disam biguation here, as m any Am ericans and I refer to generative AI which OpenAI is included in. Such
technology engages in im m oral data-scraping to generate subpar im agery and texts. And this technology also heavily dam ages the
environm ent. Many professionals in technology are also com ing to term s with the realization that the general public dislikes this technology;
generative AI is NOT profitable, and com panies need to understand how m uch their latest updates have been counterproductive to
serving their custom ers.
Why should we destroy the longstanding laws of copyright by allowing OpenAI to trudge and drag its m uddy feet into clean waters? What
should be an actual concern for national security is allowing OpenAI and generative AI to spread m ore falsehoods and fabrications,
destroying our abilities to tell true from  false.
