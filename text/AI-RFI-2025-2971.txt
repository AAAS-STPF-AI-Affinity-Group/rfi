General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit for the future of Am erica and will instead harm  the econom y and decrease the am ount of jobs available
for the public. AI cannot currently replace the efforts of hard working people and attem pting to have it do so will only rem ove jobs from
people who could use them  and decrease the quality of work done.
