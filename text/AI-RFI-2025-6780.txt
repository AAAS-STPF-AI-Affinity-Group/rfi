General Comment
That this is even being considered is a black m ark on the artistic com m unity of this country. Want to create som ething m eaningful? Get
ready for it to be stolen and repurposed by people who don't care one bit about what you actually m ade. Please don't let greedy
corporations and billionaires steal the souls of Am erican artists.
