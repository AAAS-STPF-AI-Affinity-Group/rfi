General Comment
The idea of having AI be able to steal som eone's intellectual property without any consequences is a huge problem . It is objectively theft,
and that is against the law. Making it an "exception" is opening a different can of worm s. How m uch would there be able to be stolen? Not
just random  artists, but m ovies belonging to studios, and m ore. People's privacy and likeness is already on the line, with art being
generated of them , them selves doing heinous acts.
