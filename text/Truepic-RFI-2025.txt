Re: AI Action  Plan  (Networking  and Information  Technology  Research  and Development  (NITRD)  
National Coordination Office (NCO), National Science Foundation)  
Mr. D’Souza,  
Truepic  would like to thank the National Coordination Office and the White House Office of 
Science  and Technology  Policy  for providing  the opportunity  to respond  to this RFI. Truepic  is a 
digital verification company empowering businesses and industries to drive digital 
transformation through secure and authenticated imagery. We believe that image and data 
verification  unlock  tremendous  efficiency  in industry  and government.  We are grateful  for the 
opportunity to share this information with your offices.  
Today, Truepic’s technologies serve as foundational components in the digital strategies of the 
world's largest financial institutions, insurers, and enterprises. By providing cryptographically 
assured, verifiable images and data, we enable organizations to make faster, more confident 
decisions while reducing reliance on costly and time -consuming manual verification processes. 
This breakthrough  represents  a significant  opportunity  for innovation  in the AI era and serves  as 
a method  to help  reduce  fraud  in business,  government,  and with  consumers  through  enhanced 
authentication.  
How  it Works  
For the past  decade,  Truepic’s  team  has been  at the forefront  of digital  image  authenticity  and 
data  verification,  empowering  organizations  to operate  with  confidence  in the integrity  of the 
digital content that informs their decisions. We achieve this by embedding authentication 
technology into the workflows of the world’s leading financial institutions, insurers, and 
businesses.  


Truepic’s  flagship  product,  Vision , enables  organizations  to collect  authenticated  images  and 
data  directly  from  customers,  field  agents,  or other  stakeholders  using  any smartphone.  The 
technology verifies the authenticity and provenance of each image at the point of capture, 
ensuring it has not been manipulated, edited, or artificially generated.  
When an image is captured, Truepic Vision embeds cryptographic seals  (aligning to 
interoperable  global  standards)  and verifies  metadata,  including  timestamps,  geolocation,  and 
device information, to establish a verified chain of custody. These verified images and data 
points  seamlessly  integrate  into existing  underwriting,  claims,  and risk assessment  workflows, 
reducing  fraud,  accelerating  decision -making,  and eliminating  costly  in-person  inspections.  By 
providing instant verification in digital content, Truepic Vision enables financial institutions, 
insurers, and businesses to streamline operations while ensuring the highest standards of 
authenticity and security.  
This approach  is driving  tremendous  efficiencies,  expanding  opportunities  while  also reducing 
fraud  and mitigating bad  actors.  We believe the OSTP  team  should consider  how image and  
data  authentication  can increase  efficiency,  reduce  bottlenecks,  drive  opportunities,  and better 
protect businesses and consumers today.  
Case  Studies:  Driving  Efficiency  
One key area  where  image  authenticity  and data  verification  are driving  efficiency  is in 
modernizing  business  credentialing . Traditionally,  certifying  the existence  of an asset  or 


business has relied on manual inspections and documentation reviews, which can be both 
costly  and time -intensive,  delaying  operations  and business  growth.  The ability  to verify  images 
and data  at the point  of capture,  with  cryptographic  authentication,  is fundamentally  changing 
this process. For example, in the case of business verification, digital image and data 
authentication has helped reduce processing times by 11 days , allowing businesses to be 
onboarded faster, reducing administrative burdens, and getting borrowers up and running 
faster. This shift unlocks broader economic growth and innovation.  
Another  industry  experiencing  efficiency  and innovation  through  verified  digital  inspections  is 
the warranty industry. In auto warranty , fraudulent claims and unverifiable documentation 
contribute to delays and significant fraud. Image authenticity tools prevented warranty 
providers  from  paying  an additional  10%  of claims  by flagging  them  as potentially  fraudulent, 
while cutting the time required to review claims by 66% . This has enabled companies to 
expedite decision -making, improve customer experiences, and allocate resources more 
effectively.  
Similar  efficiency  improvements  can and should  be applied  to government  workflows,  where 
authenticated digital documentation could enhance verification processes for licensing, 
permitting, and compliance monitoring, ultimately reducing delays and administrative 
overhead.  
Role  of Standards  
Truepic  ensures  its digital  verification  platform  aligns  with  and complies  with  emerging  digital 
content provenance standards developed by the Coalition for Content Provenance and  
Authenticity (C2PA) . These standards provide a universal framework for verifying the origin, 
integrity, and authenticity of digital content, helping to establish trust in an increasingly  
AI-driven  and digital -first world.  


By adhering to C2PA standards, Truepic ensures that images and data captured through its 
platform maintain a chain of custody, cryptographically proving their authenticity from the 
moment of  capture. This  approach  not only  strengthens the security  and reliability  of digital 
workflows  but also enables  interoperability  across  industries  and regulatory  environments,  a 
critical benefit for enterprises.  
Standardized  provenance  frameworks  are essential  for scaling  digital  verification  across  financial 
services, insurance, government, and other sectors that rely on authenticated content for 
critical decision -making. As policymakers and industry leaders work to develop regulations and 
best practices for content authentication, Truepic remains committed to contributing to and 
supporting these efforts, ensuring that verification technologies uphold transparency, security, 
and trust at a global scale.  
Recommendations  
Drive  Efficiency:  Federal  agencies  should  adopt  and incentivize  authenticated  digital  verification 
to eliminate bottlenecks and reduce operational costs. Many government functions still rely on 
in-person  oversight,  audits,  and inspections —whether  for State  Department  and Department  of 
Defense assistance programs, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) monitoring, Disaster 
Response, or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac compliance reviews. By adopting and incentivizing 
secure digital verification technologies, the U.S. government can enhance efficiency, reduce 
administrative costs, and accelerate decision -making across critical sectors. This shift not only 
drives significant savings but also fosters a more agile and responsive regulatory environment, 
benefiting both government operations and the industries they support.  
Consumer  & Business Protection:  Consumer  protection  can be significantly  enhanced  through 
image and data authentication backed by interoperable standards like C2PA. This technology 
helps ensure consumers interact with trustworthy digital content across e -commerce, real 
estate, and online marketplaces by preventing fraudulent listings, manipulated images, and 
misleading claims. Verified images can safeguard buyers from deceptive advertising, protect 
renters  from  misrepresented  properties,  and ensure  transparency  in auto  sales  and warranties. 
By integrating  authentication  standards  into consumer  protection  frameworks,  businesses  and 
regulators can reduce fraud, enhance trust, and create a more secure digital marketplace.  
Similarly for businesses operating in digital environments, this approach is critical to protect 
processes  and operations  in the AI era. To mitigate  risks  of deceptive  digital  content,  businesses 
must adopt authentication and verification measures that verify the integrity of digital assets, 
ensuring  that AI-generated  content  is distinguishable  from  authentic  media.  Implementing  such  


 
measures  at scale  can help  enterprises  prevent  supply  chain  fraud,  protect  CISA -designated 
critical sectors, and maintain compliance with evolving regulations. As AI -driven threats 
continue to challenge digital ecosystems, embracing standards like C2PA will be crucial for 
fostering a secure, transparent, and trustworthy online environment.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The impact of image authenticity and data verification goes beyond simply making processes 
faster —it ensures that digital content can be usable and operational at scale. In an era where 
manipulated media, AI, and unverified documentation present challenges across industries, 
establishing authenticity at the point of capture strengthens decision -making for businesses, 
governments, and consumers alike. By embedding verification mechanisms into digital 
workflows,  American  business,  government,  and society  will be prepared  to thrive  in the AI era. 
 
We look  forward  to continuing  this conversation  and are happy  to provide  further  details  and 
collaborate with the OSTP and its affiliated agencies on these critical issues.  
 
Best  regards,
