Hi!  I'm a librarian and a published author of two books from Little, Brown. I'm writing to
urge you not to legalize the theft of copyrighted intellectual property from authors, artists,
writers, and other creatives in order to train AI models. These models must use public domaindata or else obtain permission and compensate creators for the use of their property; any otherstandard would be legalized piracy. If AI companies cannot be profitable without the theft ofIP, they cannot be profitable - truly innovative companies do not need the crutch of theft.Please set a standard that will uphold the principals of copyright and the rights of creators.
