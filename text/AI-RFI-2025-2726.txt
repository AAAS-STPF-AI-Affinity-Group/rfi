General Comment
Allowing tech com panies to skirt copyright law will only serve to further dism antle it. Individuals and corporations alike will have no
protection and for a start AI corporations have a special protection that they do not need nor should have. It is unconstitutional and works
directly against the will of the Am erican people, on both sides of the political fence.
