AI has no benefit to the American public outside of stealing from its hard work, stealing
wages and scamming. So far with every major AI "innovation" not a single one has actuallyrising to the ranks of "useful". Every one has either been an outright scam or just a way torepackage someone else's work, which is just stealing.
 
None of this even goes into the energy consumption issues. For a country that's hell bent onproducing just more coal power it seems like they don't understand just how massivelyinefficient AI is. You'd just give it full access to the publics hard work and then give it endlessamounts of power and money to do so. Sounds pretty communist to me.
