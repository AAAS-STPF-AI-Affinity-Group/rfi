General Comment
Having a specific com pany and or a specific com pany m odel with an exem ption from  the federal governm ent allowing for intellectual
property theft sets forth a dangerous precedent. And let’s not m ince words, using copyright works without com pensation for creators of
said work is theft. These learning m odels have already been caught stealing works protected by copyright, and now are seeking essentially
a pardon and the legal right to do so after the fact. I’ve m ade neural networking m odels for both work and in m y graduate program , and
know first hand these “AI m odels” can do no creation of their own, they need to be fed data and work pioneered by others. Therefore
whoever has their work used, should be fairly com pensated, as is the spirit of copyright protections. You cannot have selective copyright
enforcem ent, you cannot have a chosen class allowed to steal. It is outside the spirit of the law.
