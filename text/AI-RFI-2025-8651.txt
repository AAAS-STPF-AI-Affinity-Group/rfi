General Comment
Giving AI com panies full control over training their system s on content that specifically does not belong to them  threatens not just
copyright laws and artists,’ but privacy and data from  others as a whole. Personal inform ation or conversations discussed online is at risk
of being used by these com panies. The internet is currently being used by 5.56 billion people. 5.56 billion people’s inform ation and
content is at risk of being used without consent. I fear you m ay also be at risk of your inform ation being used too.
