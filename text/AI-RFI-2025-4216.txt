General Comment
AI training done without explicit consent of those whose data it's being trained on is theft and should be treated as such. Any organization,
com pany, or individual creating or using a system  that is trained on such stolen data is deliberately and knowingly stealing intellectual
property. There is no place for such tech in any governm ent that wants to be taken seriously. 
Shoving AI into everything is very m uch like the failed attem pt to shove NFTs into everything just a few years back - a poorly designed
scam  m ade to fill the pockets of those whose pockets are already full. It does nothing to benefit regular people, only in case of GenAI it
directly harm s those who work in creative fields. Thousands and thousands of people have already lost their jobs due to their superiors
im plem enting AI-based features or their clients choosing to use AI-generated elem ents over original creations. It hurts the econom y in the
long run as m ore and m ore people are being m indlessly replaced with som ething that isn't even rem otely close to producing results of the
sam e quality. 
That is not to m ention the horrifying ecological consequences of using such tech without regulation, sim ilar to crypto m ining and NFTs. All
such technology should be heavily reviewed and regulated instead of being used m indlessly with no consideration for the planet's lim ited
resources and its population.
