General Comment
Hello, I am  speaking as both a freelance artist and a citizen of the US. I would like to say that any plan involving the use of generative AI
(or any AI at the forefront) is a bad plan. It does not hold any future in the US that will bring prosperity.
It has gone from  just a tool people use to m ake m em es to one that corporations have used to attem pt legal theft and plagiarism  of ideas. It
has also been used as a m eans to deny m any people their jobs, and I fear it m ay com e to a point where if left unchecked, every executive
will lean on AI tools as a crutch to not pay their em ployees.
It has becom e an overhyped and fleeting fad that should not be given any leniency; so I urge whatever governm ent official reads this, to
put a stop to any AI-related plans in our governing body before it becom es im m une to copyright lawsuits and is taken advantage of by
those who only see people as walking dollar signs and nothing else.
This is a m atter of livelihood and being able to afford to be a creative for a lot of people; artists, voice actors, m ovie actors, gam e
developers, film m akers, m usicians, writers, and eventually the people who watch, read, view, listen, or play their work will be caught in
the crossfire.
