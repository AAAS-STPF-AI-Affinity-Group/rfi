General Comment
While I believe artificial intelligence has its place in Am erica's future, it is being used to destroy creativity and fill the world with bleak, fake
"art" that has the intention of taking tens of thousands of jobs in various fields, putting m any out of work. For people like m e who has
always wanted to be an artist and for m any like m e who have spent thousands of hours to hone our skills, it would be devastating. Artists
already struggle to find work in this day in age and with the cost of living continuing to increase, allowing organizations like OpenAI to just
have infinite resources and zero accountability for their actions is a slap in the face of the m illions of us who wanted to try and m ake the
world a better, brighter place. Artificial intelligence should be used to advance m edical science, it should be used to m ake m enial tasks
easier, but it should never, ever replace the im agination of the hum an m ind. 
I am  writing this because I am  firm ly against this plan, the private sector already gets away with too m uch and I cannot stay silent while
m illions of people struggle. Only a few will benefit from  this action, m aking the private sector richer as they destroy livelihoods with zero
rem orse, so m any people are already out of work and struggling to find jobs, the advancem ent of Artificial Intelligence with the purpose of
replacing individuals will only m ake this struggle m uch, m uch worse. I im plore the regulators to understand how m uch this will affect
people's lives because I fear it will only be used to m ake people's lives m ore m iserable than it already is.
