General Comment
The com panies providing AI com putation should be required to pay for the m any secondary costs of this technology, i.e. extrem e energy
consum ption and environm ental fallout. The consequences of unscrupulous expansion m ust be accounted for and prevented, which can
only happen by reigning in heedless actors. There m ust be extensive work done on responsible use of the technology, including via public
education cam paigns, in laws preem ptively safeguarding Am ericans from  outsourced decision-m aking left to flawed algorithm s. “A
com puter cannot be held accountable; therefore a com puter m ust never m ake m anagem ent decisions“ should be a well-known and
enforced standard before m ore lives, industries, and econom ies are forced to suffer for corporate use of AI.
