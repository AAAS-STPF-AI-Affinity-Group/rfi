General Comment
AI is still very m uch too new of a technology to be used responsibly without strong guidelines. 
Besides the already notes problem s in m odern education of students using it to cheat instead of doing the work; m odern generative AI
m ust rely on existing m aterial to base what it will generate to a prom pt.
Unfortunately, m any of those people who are trying to claim  this technology is a Net good still believe that their AI m odels should have
unfettered access to copyrighted and protected works without due com pensation for the owners.
We do not steal from  the farm er who grows our food, we do not steal from  the tailor who m akes our clothes, we do not steal from  the
factory worker who m akes our goods or the engineer who designs them .
Writers, artists, editors, etc. work hard to develop their talent, and produce hum an culture that explores who and what we are. No one
can doubt such sem inal works that serve as m odern academ ic form ation and personal exploration. They deserve to be com pensated for
their tim e and effort.
AI m odels trained on these works without com pensation is nothing but the worst kind of theft, all to produce m aterial rem arkably inferior
to actual hum an talent. 
Protect the rights of creators, not venture technologists who cannot be bothered to do the right thing
