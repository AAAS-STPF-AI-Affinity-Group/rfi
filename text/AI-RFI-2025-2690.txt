General Comment
AI has no place in the United States. It affects hard workers everywhere in every field, spreads dangerous m isinform ation, and has led to
countless lives ruined. It will im pact m y life and m y livelihood, and giving it im m unities under the guise of “national security” is a m ove only
for the greedy and ignorant. Please stand by the people of the United States and regulate the industry harder before it gets out of control.
