Hello, 
I wanted to inquire about recent plans with AI. Please do not give OpenAI free reign. This
only hurts the average person, AI is already becoming invasive and a huge issue, and allowingAI companies freedom from copyright infringement regarding AI generation will only makethings worse. Especially regarding using the likeness of people, that is a very dangerous roadto give anyone freedom to do anything they want with people's likeness. AI is not as great asyou're trying to push, and most people do not like it, and it should not be encouraged.
