Re: Notice of Request for Information (RFI) on Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
Action Plan 
The Digital Energy Council (DEC) appreciates the opportunity to respond to this Request for 
Information (RFI) regarding the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Development 
of an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. With respect to the initiative, we discuss below 
additional considerations for addressing energy challenges, particularly as AI applications 
proliferate and energy demand increases.  
About the Digital Energy Council 
The Digital Energy Council (DEC) is a non-profit advocacy organization whose 
preeminent members work at the forefront of the energy and technology industries. DEC 
was founded to shape the future of energy use and inform policymakers about the 
important cross-section between the energy industry and the digital applications driving a 
new economy. As society becomes increasingly digital, the energy sector must evolve to 
keep pace. It is essential for the energy ecosystem to embrace new technologies and adapt 
to meet growing demand.  
Need for Action 
The U.S. energy system is experiencing significant demand driven by the 21st century digital 
economy. The energy sector has an interest in exploring innovative methods of leveraging energy 
resources to meet demand associated with digital technologies. Data centers currently consume 
approximately 2-3% of the total electricity in the United States, with energy demand projected to 
rise substantially in conjunction with buildout of large-scale computing facilities.1 
In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), bitcoin mining, and high-performance computing 
(HPC), the concept of “digital energy” represents the synergy between the broader energy sector 
and the technologies driving the digital economy that require significant computational power. 
These new technologies can work with our energy systems efficiency, reliability, and can even 
foster resource development in certain situations. To meet the rising demand for energy, it is 
imperative that we consider innovative solutions. Leveraging AI, HPC, and bitcoin mining 
presents the Trump Administration with an opportunity to use all tools and technologies at our 1 https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62409 


disposal to advance the United States’ digital energy agenda with any and all fuel sources. 
Energy dominance will be the key to asserting the United States’ technology dominance.  
Overcoming Bottlenecks in the Energy Transmission System 
A critical near-term action for the administration’s whole-of-government AI strategy should be 
interconnection queue reform to address the rapidly growing energy demands of AI and HPC. As 
the administration seeks to foster a business environment where new AI-driven projects can 
break ground quickly, it must tackle the persistent bottlenecks in the U.S. transmission system. 
Currently, interconnection queues are lengthy, opaque, and overburdened, delaying critical 
energy infrastructure necessary to support AI workloads. Without streamlined reforms that 
enhance transparency, efficiency, and coordination among grid operators and developers, the 
United States risks falling behind in the global race for digital energy leadership. AI innovation 
depends on scalable, reliable, and sustainable power, but funded projects are stuck waiting for 
years due to outdated interconnection processes.  
The Growing Concern of Foreign Control over Digital Infrastructure 
The United States’ adversaries are increasingly offering financial incentives, strategic 
advantages, and favorable regulatory treatment to attract digital infrastructure companies to 
relocate their operations overseas. These tactics pose a significant concern for U.S. national 
security, economic stability, privacy, and cyber resilience, particularly for the energy industry, 
which depends on secure data systems for operations. 
The United States’ adversaries use tax breaks, grants, and subsidies to lure technology 
infrastructure construction. This strategy reduces U.S. influence over critical infrastructure and 
has raised concerns regarding security and national interests.  Foreign adversaries can gain 
physical access to sensitive data through data centers, which could allow them to influence 
operations, monitor communications, or manipulate data. 
Many countries with weak or lax data protection laws present risks for the confidentiality of U.S. 
data stored in their data centers. Countries like Russia, China, India, and the UAE have been 
identified as potential vulnerabilities.  Control over data centers also provides adversaries with 
strategic advantages, such as a platform for cyber-espionage, the ability to disrupt U.S. services, 
and the potential to target critical sectors like energy. 
Use AI and HPC to Support Energy Infrastructure 
AI and HPC technologies have revolutionized various industries, enabling us to process vast 
amounts of data efficiently and solve complex problems. These technologies can be utilized to 
optimize energy production, distribution, and consumption. By employing AI algorithms and 
HPC systems, we can enhance predictive maintenance in energy infrastructure, improve grid 
management, and optimize energy usage in buildings and industrial processes. Furthermore, 
AI-driven simulations can facilitate the development of advanced energy technologies.

Leverage Bitcoin Mining to Improve Energy Grid Efficiency and Resilience 
By integrating Bitcoin mining operations with energy grids, excess energy generated from 
intermittent sources can be utilized for mining activities during off-peak hours, thus maximizing 
resource utilization and minimizing wastage. Mining operations have also demonstrated that 
their unique “flexible load” can be leveraged during emergency situations by curtailing demand. 
Recommendations 
A whole-of-government approach to energy and technology is needed. Accordingly, the 
Trump administration should:  
●Amplify expertise in critical and emerging technology and leverage these capabilities to
solve critical science, energy, and security challenges facing the Nation;
●Coordinate equities in critical and emerging technologies across diverse program
portfolios, including the DOE National Labs, to support and inform policy making;●Partner with industry (energy & tech) and academia to advance breakthroughs and
accelerate integration of energy technologies into the U.S. commercial sector.
●Revisit the Trump Administration's American AI Initiative via Executive Order 13859
and explore incorporating an added emphasis on energy as a top priority.  Develop a
regulatory guidance to govern the deployment and operation of AI, HPC, and Bitcoin
mining facilities within the energy sector. A pro-business and deregulatory approach
encouraged innovation in AI and data centers.●Allocate resources towards research and development initiatives aimed at exploring the
potential of AI, HPC, and Bitcoin mining as energy resources to advance industries of the
future. Foster collaborations with academic institutions, industry partners, and technology
innovators to accelerate progress in this area.●Initiate pilot projects to test the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating AI, HPC, and
Bitcoin mining with existing energy infrastructure.  Incentivize infrastructure
development in coordination with our energy systems.●Educate stakeholders and the general public about the potential benefits of digital energy,
leveraging AI, HPC, and Bitcoin mining as resources. Address concerns related to energy
consumption, sustainability, and economic viability through transparent communication
and outreach efforts.
Conclusion 
The Digital Energy Council firmly believes that technological advancements can only progress 
as far as the energy foundation upon which they are built. The United States cannot maintain its 
leadership in innovation without a robust, reliable, and forward-thinking energy strategy.   
Ensuring a strong energy foundation is not just an economic necessity—it is a prerequisite for 
continued innovation and global leadership. 
We appreciate the opportunity to respond to this RFI and look forward to serving as a resource 
for these important and complex issue areas. Please do not hesitate to reach out at
