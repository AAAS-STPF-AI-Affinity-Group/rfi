General Comment
I am  an art student who’s looking into starting a free lance career in art. I wish to provide for m y fam ily and especially m y special needs
little brother who needs constant surveillance. 
If the continuation of the adm inistration’s policies on AI goes forwards then I m ay not be able to provide for m y fam ily. If com panies don’t
see any reason to spend m oney on an individual or groups of individuals then thousands of people will be jobless. 
I understand you wish to be as efficient as possible with your policies and plans but this decision is the worst thing to com e to fruition.
I im plore you to look past the m oney and see the people on the other side who look to you as a leader.
