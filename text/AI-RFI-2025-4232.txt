General Comment
AI should not be exem pt from  copyright law due to the disruption it has already caused creative fields and that AI com panies have shown
that their businesses rely on integrating existing content to strengthen their m odels. If AI is allowed to continue to develop without
regulation or oversight any m aterial shared on the internet or to AI, legal or otherwise, will becom e part of a business strategy for
com panies to perpetuate stealing content they do not own.
