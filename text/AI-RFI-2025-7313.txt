General Comment
I have three m ain argum ents to m ake against OpenAi being given exem ptions with regards to IP perm issions:
1. OpenAi has incorporated as a business. If it cannot afford to purchase the inputs it needs to m ake it's products, then it is not a viable
business and shouldn't be subsidized by federal regulation. If it were a non-profit, perhaps that would be different.
2. Carving out special exceptions for our AI industry has m ade it less com petitive internationally. Governm ent subsidies for Am erican
com panies and protectionism  against the Chinese led to com placency that com panies like DeepSeek have used to steal a m arch and put
innovate Am erican com panies.
3. AI has not proven to be of practical valuable such that it deserves further special treatm ent from  the US public. There is sim ply not a
dem onstrable use case of extrem e value for this technology. If there were, they could charge high prices for their products and wouldn't
need carve outs from  governm ent
