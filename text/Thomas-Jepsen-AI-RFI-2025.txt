To whom this may concern,  
I write today on behalf of several independent publishers and content creators who are being
systematically exploited by artificial intelligence (AI) companies that scrape, repurpose, andmonetize our work without consent or compensation. As the federal government charts itscourse for AI policy, we urge you to recognize the devastating impact of these predatorypractices and take immediate steps to ensure fair protections for smaller publishers.
The Unchecked Theft of Content
AI companies have built their large language models (LLMs) by extracting content fromacross the internet—often without permission, credit, or financial compensation. These modelsconsume the painstakingly researched, written, and published material of independentjournalists, bloggers, and niche publishers, only to regurgitate it in AI-generated summaries,responses, and articles. Meanwhile, the original creators see none of the profits reaped by AIfirms, nor do they receive traffic or recognition from this usage.
This is nothing short of digital exploitation. The same small publishers who have struggled to
sustain themselves in an increasingly challenging media landscape are now watching as AI-driven platforms siphon away their value, all while undercutting their ability to earn a living.AI-generated content, often derived from our original reporting and analysis, is replacing theneed for users to visit our websites, further strangling revenue sources. This, in addition, toGoogle's 2023 HCU update, which left small publishers with little information as to why theirsites' traffic was decimated.
 
AI’s Impact on the Free and Diverse Press
A democracy thrives on a free, diverse, and independent press. When small publishersdisappear, information ecosystems become monopolized by a handful of corporate giants andAI-generated noise, eroding public discourse. The unregulated scraping of content threatens:
The Sustainability of Local Journalism – Small newsrooms and niche publishersprovide vital information to communities, covering issues that larger outlets ignore. IfAI companies continue to profit from their labor without returning any value, thesepublishers will collapse.
The Integrity of Information – AI models aggregate and remix information withoutcritical verification, leading to the spread of misinformation, outdated data, anddecontextualized narratives. When AI replaces human editorial oversight, we lose thenuance, accountability, and ethical rigor that real journalism provides.


The Rights of Content Creators – Copyright laws exist to protect creators, yet AI
firms have effectively rewritten these rules by scraping content at scale with impunity.
The lack of enforcement is setting a dangerous precedent where intellectual propertyrights are meaningless.
Policy Recommendations for the AI Action Plan
To ensure that AI development respects content creators, we propose the following urgentpolicy actions:
1.Mandatory Consent and Opt-Out Mechanisms  – AI companies must obtain explicit
permission from content creators before using their work. Websites should have legallyenforceable options to block AI scraping.
2.Compensation for Content Usage  – Just as music streaming services pay royalties to
artists, AI firms should be required to compensate publishers whose content is used totrain or fuel AI-generated responses.
3.Transparent AI Training Disclosures – AI developers must publicly disclose thesources of their training data and make clear which publishers and content repositorieshave been included.
4.Regulatory Enforcement and Penalties  – Federal agencies must actively monitor and
penalize AI firms that violate copyright protections and engage in mass scraping withoutauthorization.
5.Protections for Small Publishers in AI Search Integration  – As AI-driven search
experiences emerge, government policies should ensure that original publishers arecredited and receive traffic from AI-generated summaries.
The promise of AI should not come at the expense of those who create the very content itrelies upon. A fair AI ecosystem must be built on ethical data use, transparency, and respectfor intellectual property. Without urgent intervention, small publishers will continue to bemarginalized, leading to an information landscape dominated by a few powerful entities withlittle accountability.
I strongly urge OSTP and NITRD to prioritize these issues in the AI Action Plan to prevent
further exploitation of small publishers. Thank you for considering these concerns, and I hopethe federal government will take action to ensure AI innovation does not trample overindependent journalism and creative content.
SincerelyThomas Jepsen
