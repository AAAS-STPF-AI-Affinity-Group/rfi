General Comment
While AI is an im pressive technology, it needs to be given a hard clam p. The rights of fair use and copyright shouldn't be com prom ised for
a technology that can be so easily used to harm  and ruin the livelihoods of so m any Am ericans.
I strongly advise against allowing AI to violate the rights and privacy of the people, and furtherm ore there needs to be real, genuine
protections for those that generative AI screws over (art, m usic, etc.).
