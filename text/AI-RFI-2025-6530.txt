General Comment
If open ai wants to use copyright protected m aterial then they should be forced to pay for the copyright just as any other citizen or
com pany would 
Because thereâ€™s no difference between open ai stealing copyrighted art from  a sm all artist or business then Walm art stealing the logo of a
m a and pa shop 
All is protected or nothing is protected no m iddle ground
