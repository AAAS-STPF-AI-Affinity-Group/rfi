General Comment
AI cannot be allowed free access to proprietary im ages, text, video, or any end user generated content. This would am ount to sim ple theft
and m ustn't be granted any further latitude. The proper context for AI would be a tool lim ited to a discrete pool of data, writing, art,
im ages, etc. for m achine synthesizing.
