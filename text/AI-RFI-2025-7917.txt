General Comment
Copyright m ust be protected. It is established law and case law that use of a copyrighted work to produce a "new" work is theft (Grand
Upright Music Ltd. vs. Warner Brothers Records, LTD). If access to copyrighted works is necessary for the developm ent of AI, then the
AI com panies need to fairly com pensate copyright holders on m utually agreed term s. This should be considered a developm ent cost, just
as coders and hardware are. If an AI com pany is unwilling to respect copyright, they should suffer legal consequences, not be shielded
from  them .
