General Comment
As an aspiring writer of fiction and student of literature, I do not understand or approve of technology that steals the work of others
without consent in order to “learn” or replace genuine hum an expression with algorithm ically generated fluff. 
I dem and action be taken to regulate this technology’s developm ent so that it does not freely steal and to prevent corporations from  using
it as a replacem ent for hum an artists!
