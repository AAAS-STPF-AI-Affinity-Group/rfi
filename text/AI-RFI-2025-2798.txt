General Comment
AI has evolved faster than ethics has kept up. Until we can protect writers and artists from  blatant AI plagiarism , we need to regulate and
reduce our use and reliance on AI. 
In addition, I have a lot of concerns about the environm ental im pact of using these m assive servers. We already have a clim ate change
problem , why accelerate it with AI?
