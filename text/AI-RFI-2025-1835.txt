General Comment
Generative AI as it stands now is an unethical job stealing, energy inefficient m oney suck. It steals jobs from  creative hum ans and lowers
the quality of entertainm ent. Generative AI has no soul and steals the hum an elem ent from  creation which leaves us all poorer. 
If the governm ent m ust put m ore effort into this loser creation you m ust also protect the copyright of hum an creators first. You m ust allow
hum an artists, m usicians and creatives to protect their livelyhood from  those who wish to digitally steal from  and profit from  their hard
work and innovation. 
You m ust solve the energy consum ption problem . AI takes m ore energy than som e countries and that is absurd and not sustainable long
term . 
There are better things to focus on that a soliton to a problem  that doesn’t exist. Hum ans are already VERY good at m aking artwork and
m usic and m ovies and gam es. We don’t need a com puter to generate it for us, unless your goal is just to disallow people from  m aking a
living in the creative field.
