General Comment
Generative AI (LLMs, Im age Generators, et al.) as it currently exists, is a m oney pit. A waste of com putational power that servers no
greater purpose other than adding errors and overhead to any field where it is im plem ented. This is not to m ention the m oral im plications
of the wholesale theft of intellectual property, that is used to run and continually feed these m odels. So that they can continue to churn out
useless slop that nobody wants. That said, any 'Action Plan' regarding AI should be one that seeks to protect rights holders and creatives
first and forem ost. No generation without proper com pensation. If AI Com panies cannot continue to exist while properly paying for the
works they use, then they do not deserve to exist.
