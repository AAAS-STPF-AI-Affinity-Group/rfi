General Comment
I am  an upcom ing artist, and i am  going to keep things sim ple. AI has been rapidly affecting m y com m unity and its m isuse has caused
m any artists who do this for a living trouble. Not only is this AI art taking jobs from  artists them selves, but it’s also used to steal people’s
ideas, as it learns from  art all over the internet. When AI is trained by these different art pieces, it is m ost of the tim e not crediting these
artworks. When a hum an does it, it’s plagiarism . But when a robot does it that’s being USED by a HUMAN, it’s okay? It’s not m orally
right and it’s not ethical. This regulation needs to be put in place to stop AI artists from  stealing artwork from  others and m ake them  to do
everything properly like everyone else.
