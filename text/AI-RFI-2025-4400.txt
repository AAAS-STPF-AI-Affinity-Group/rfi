General Comment
At no point have com panies like OpenAI presented anything dem onstrating they have a greater right to an IP than the holder of said IP.
Their claim  that being held to the law would be burdensom e is a dem onstration of what their products are actually capable of, m erely
regurgitating words in an order based on probability, and a farce of a defense. If they cannot build a system  without a gross violation of
property rights, they have no right to continue working on that system . Any serious exam ination of what they have produced thus far
reveals that, even while stealing from  nearly everyone, they failed to m ake a functioning system , neverm ind anything capable of knowledge.
Just a com puter that will confidently get m ath wrong. About the only thing they can do is violate the rights of others, generative false
endorsem ents, and create obscene pornography of nonconsenting people, real people, adults and children alike.
