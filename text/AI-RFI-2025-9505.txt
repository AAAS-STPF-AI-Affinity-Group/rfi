General Comment
I do not approve of tech com panies being able to steal copyrighted work under any circum stance. AI will only serve to allow corporations
to steal jobs from  hard working m iddle class fam ilies, while offering sub par replacem ents that will ultim ately destroy whatever industry it
touches. Intellectual property and the ability for creatives and workers to have ownership and choice of use over their hard earned
concepts and creations is the backbone of the creative industry and allowing AI to thieve and steal without com pensation or consent will
only serve to ruin our econom y as people are dum ped out of jobs. AI is too expensive, too dam aging to the environm ent, and gives little in
return to m ake it worth the cost. Please do not allow AI com panies to steal the hard work of individual workers.
