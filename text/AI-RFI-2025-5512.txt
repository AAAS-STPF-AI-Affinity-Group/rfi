General Comment
Generative AI is theft, and should be treated as such. We don’t need an AI action plan for im plem entation, we need an action plan to lim it
the power of AI com panies to the point where this ridiculous technology crashes and burns as it deserves. The com panies them selves
have said they can’t exist if they have to pay for training m aterial - sounds to m e like they shouldn’t pretend to be in business anym ore.
