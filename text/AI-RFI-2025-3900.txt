General Comment
AI has constantly been proven to not be used in the right ways to further advance our society and instead hinder it. We need to have
regulation on AI and use it for things that assist people in every day life. Currently AI is used to steal copyrighted m aterial and work
against m edia literacy as well as use for m aking distasteful jokes. 
Please keep regulations on AI for all of us.
