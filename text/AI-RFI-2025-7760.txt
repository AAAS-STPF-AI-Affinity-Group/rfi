General Comment
As an artist running a sm all business, I'm  extrem ely concerned about the protections that copyright law provides to creative endeavors and
intellectual property. "Artificial intelligence" applications that "create" generative work are currently trained on tons of scraped data from
m illions of writers, artists, photographers, m usicians, and m ore. This has been illegal since day one and should have never happened.
Copyright law has always required explicit perm ission from  the IP holder in all uses of that content, and these protections encourage
REAL hum an creativity. Generative AI has stolen huge am ounts of data and directly underm ines the irreplaceable im portance of hum an
creativity and innovation by attem pting to supplant the people who created the works that trained it in the first place. 
I urge all involved to require m easures in this AI action plan that uphold current copyright law and protect artists and other creatives.
Technological advancem ent should not and cannot be built through the exploitation of creative IP.
