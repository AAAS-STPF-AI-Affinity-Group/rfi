The so called "AI" such as OpenAI and other such sources are, as a whole, a waste of time,
resources, and technology. Even more, by investing in such sources not only does itdiscourage creative freedom, but it also breaks copyright infringement, trademarks, and otherintellectual property.
There is a use for similar software when it comes to detective or specific purposes, like in
medical research, but any use available for the public would be pointless at best.
Therefore, the best investment into AI possible would be to handicap all such open source
companies, and then redirect efforts into specific fields 'AI' usage
