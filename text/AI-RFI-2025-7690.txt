General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is a scourge on the creative sector. It deprives m illions of their livelihoods as writers, visual artists, m usicians, and
film m akers. To create its m onstrous content it depends on “training” on the copyrighted works of m illions of people who have spent years
of their lives and m illions and m illions of dollars to create these works. The original creators are not credited nor com pensated (in fact,
generative AI is m ore likely to create fictitious citations) and are further put out of work by the AI apparatus. This doesn’t even get into
the high cost of environm ental and electrical resources that generative AI relies on to operate. This is a horrible idea all around.
