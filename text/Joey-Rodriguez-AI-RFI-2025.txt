Hello,
Regarding the AI Action Plan, I express my opposition.There is a misunderstanding in holding leadership within AI technology. The market has sold and convinced the
public that its sheer existence is advancement. AI is more uncontrolled and unregulated than aspects of our moderninternet. Investment in this naive state of AI further fuels the strain on American jobs, livelihood, and marketconsistency. AI needs to be regulated and better understood before blindly trusting in such a process in its infancy.
This blind spearhead will further escalate the economic strain on the American working class and only further
pushes the agenda that the administration is only investing in corporations. Regulate AI, be the leadership ineducation and knowledge to ethically use and invest in AI-not replace and cheapen the authenticity of Americanculture.
