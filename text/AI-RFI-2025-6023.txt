General Comment
I was told that "National security hinges on unfettered access to AI training data, OpenAI says." This is not only incorrect at best, but
em barrassingly wrong at worst and stupid all around. National security hinges on actual person-to-person conversation, first-person
observations, and data collected by educated, trained individuals. It relies on non-partisan well-trained diplom ats and educated, m ulti-
lingual personnel. It relies on actual hum ans who understand nuances that technology cannot ever "understand." It does not rely on
whether or not a m achine has unfettered access to the Baby Sitters Club series, Mary Higgins Clark books, Encyclopedia Britannica, and
the back catalog of Penthouse forum  letters.
If OpenAI the product cannot succeed on its own, then it wasn't ever good or needed to begin with.
