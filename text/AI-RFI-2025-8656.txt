General Comment
AI should not be exem pt from  copyright laws and should not be allowed to legally steal from  the hard work of actual hum an creators. It
doesn't have a place in the future of the United States, and it is both over hyped and also is swindling the Am erican public who do not
know the actual im pact of it. 
AI also steals from  the livelihoods of Am ericans including m yself, and actively profits off of such theft to line the pockets of the few who
know what it is actually doing. I ask that as a a fellow Am erican, please reject this regulation and disallow both OpenAI and all AI
com panies from  being able to steal from  us.
