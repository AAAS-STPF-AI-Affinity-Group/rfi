General Comment
Hello I'm  writing this to say that I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US because AI steals from  m y livelihood as an
Am erican and profits off of theft of artwork, m usic, writing, even people's voices are being stolen from  to replace all voice actors with ai
which will rem ove a huge portion of jobs and significantly hurt sm all business particularly artists, voice actors, writers,and m usicians, and
photographers as their work is stolen by storing it in an AI database to copy and learn from  for the purposes of replacing the people that
have m ade the work that ai has learned from . Allowibg so to scan and steal all copyrighted work is going to be disastrous for sm all
businesses and independent people, court case Naruto v. David Slater aka the "m onkie selfie" court case where the courts determ ined
that only hum ans can hold a copyright and since every picture has a copyright on it ai should be required to respect copyright law and not
be allowed to steal copyrighted im ages especially when it's being done to replace the people who m ake ai learning possible. I hope that
you'll support sm all businesses and Am ericans who need to protect there copyrighted work to insure the continuation of their business and
stop AI from  continuing to steal people's work.
