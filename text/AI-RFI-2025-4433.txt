General Comment
It is patently absurd to m ake a special legal carve-out for AI in copyright law. Every respectable legal scholar agrees that it is an absurd
violation of both the letter and the spirit of the Copyright clause of the Constitution. “Exclusive right” m eans “exclusive,” not “exclusive of
everything except the whim  of an AI-infatuated executive who thinks he’s the special-est little boy.” What encouragem ent does it provide
to science and art for scientists and artists to see their hard work fed into the m aw of the slush m achine without their consent? None.
There is no encouragem ent, only the discouragem ent and disparagem ent of hum an creativity. No unconstitutional carve-out.
