General Comment
This is vile. I am  an artist and I do NOT appreciate m y work being recycled through this disgusting perversion of creativity. Sham e on all
of you for trying to m ake it legal to steal from  people who put their tim e, their effort, their m inds to work creating things. This is not what I
voted for, this is not what I want, it's disgusting and it's the end of creativity as we know it.
Sham e on you all.
