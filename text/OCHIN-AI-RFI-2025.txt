Re: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  
Dear Mr. D’Souza,   
On behalf of OCHIN,  we thank you for  the opportunity to respond to the  Networking and 
Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office’s 
(NCO) request for information  (RFI) on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action 
Plan  (“Plan”)  on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) . We applaud the 
Administration efforts to strengthen America’s AI capabilities, ensuring that innovation remains 
at the forefront while upholding the principles of security and transparency. The United States 
stands at an inflection po int in global AI leadership. While flagship health  care centers are 
adopting AI to improve health outcomes and reduce cost, crucial gaps remain in rural and low 
resourced  communities, which comprise a significant portion of the nation’s infrastructure, 
workforce, and economic potential. For the US to continue its global leadership in AI, health 
care providers in rural and low resourced  communities must have the tools needed to 
participate in AI as active contributors and innovators .  
OCHIN: DRIVING INNOVATION, COST -EFFICIENCY , AND SELF -SUFFICIENCY  
OCHIN is a  national  nonprofit  health  information technology  and research network  that 
serves more than  300 independent organizations with  2,000 health care delivery sites  in 42 
states . For over  two decades, OCHIN has provided technology solutions, informatics, evidence -
based research, and policy insights  for critical access hospitals (CAHs), rural emergency 
hospitals (REHs), rural and frontier health clinics, community health centers, and federally 
qualified health centers (FQHCs) .  
With 25 years of experience, we have seen firsthand how investing in cutting -edge technology 
empowers providers to offer  higher -quality, data -driven care while protecting patient 
information from cyber threats , including mal icious  foreign actors . For example, in the OCHIN

translate clinical questionnaires; provide chart summaries; and automate actions like imaging 
follow -ups.  
 
UNLEASHING AI’S POTENTIAL  IN RURAL AND LOW RESOURCED  COMMUNITIES  IN AMERICA  
 
Rural and low resourced  communities are sitting on untapped potential, and AI will be the 
catalyst for transformation.  
• Rural and low resourced  communities need investments in AI infrastructure and readiness 
to drive America’s next wave of tech -driven prosperity.  
• Health care providers often are among the largest employers in these communities making 
AI investments a direct engine  of financial health among local and regional employers . 
• Investing in AI means fueling job creation, attracting top talent, and modernizing essential 
services —all while enhancing patient care and superior AI systems .  
• Without modernized health IT  infrastructur e, health care providers  cannot fully participate 
in AI -driven advancements, putting them –and the broader US economy –at a competitive 
disadvantage .  
• AI is already transforming  diagnostics, predictive analytics, and operational efficiency  but 
providers in rural and low resourced  areas operating with outdated systems and razor -thin 
margins cannot leverage these innovations.  
• Without targeted investments, they will  become AI deserts –falling behind on 
cybersecurity, workforce readiness, and economic growth .  
 
AI models trained on narrow range of health care settings limit  their predictive power and 
commercial viability.   
• When  AI systems are built using data from only large academic institutions, they struggle to 
perform reliabl y in other environments, such as rural hospitals  which have different 
workflows, staffing levels, and patient  health needs .  
• This weakens AI’s predictive power and undermines its potential for solving specific 
challenges and driving dramatically improved outcomes .  
• To build robust globally competitive AI systems, all providers, especially those in rural and 
low resourced  areas, must be integrated into AI development , validation, deployment, 
and monitoring . 
 
A strong, resilient nation requires secure, AI -ready health care systems across all health  care 
provide rs. 
• With the rapid acceleration of AI across all sectors, we risk leaving providers in rural and 
low resourced  areas behind if they do not receive investments to upgrade critical 
infrastructure and defend against cyber threats . 
• To counter escalating cyber threats posed by criminal organizations and foreign actors, we 
must harden health care infrastructure, cultivate the next wave of cybersecurity and AI 
talent, and invest in scalable, self -reliant solutions.   


3 RECOMMENDATIONS  
Equip Providers in Rural and Low resourced  Areas with Modern AI -Ready Health IT Systems  
Recommendation:  Repurpose  and streamline existing funding programs , such as  the USDA 
Community Grant Program under the Farm Bill , to equip  providers in rural and low resourced  
communities with modernized health IT systems.  Further, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention received significant funding to modernize health IT systems, but local providers 
including those in rural communities have not been eligible to access these funds.  
•Providers in rural and low resourced  areas have minimal capital for health IT infrastructure
modernization, yet this is the very infrastructure they need to transition to financial
sustainability and practice transformation that will drive vastly improved outcomes .
•U.S. global leadership in AI depends on  modern, interoperable , and secure IT systems  that
allow all  providers to participate in AI -driven  development and deployment .
•AI-ready certified, hosted, and maintained health IT systems can expedite patient care,
improve financial optimization, reduce waste and repetition , and drive exponential
improvements in  patient care .
Fund AI Readiness and Cybersecurity to Secure U .S. Health Care Infrastructure  
Recommendation: Invest in integrated AI and cybersecurity  readiness to  ensure that providers 
in rural and low resourced  communities have the skills, technical assistance , and tools to 
acquire, validate, deploy , scale , and monitor  AI systems .  
•AI readiness must include  essential
cybersecurity tools for risk
assessments, audits  and secure AI
model deployment , along with
cybersecurity insurance to protect
health  care infrastructure.
•Cyberattacks cost providers over  $10
million per incident , often forcing
closures –far exceeding the costs of
preventive security measures that
range  from $50,000 -$250,000
annually .
•Strategic investment s in prevention will yield high returns by avoiding  breaches,
maintaining  clinical operations, and protecting  patient care.
•Certified  hosted and maintained health IT systems are a critical part of the equation as they
include  multi -factor authentication, encryption, and automated security protocols which
will reduce costs and improve cybersecurity resilience.

 Leverage AI as a Job Creator  
Recommendation:  Disrupt and redesign workforce development and training by shifting  to 
skills -based training , replacing outdated  apprenticeship models  designed for traditional  trades .  
• Legacy training models do not 
support rapid, modular learning 
necessary for AI adoption . 
• Training m odels must power  
upskill ing for  the entire health care 
team with career ladders and 
continuous learning .  
• AI-driven health IT roles can create 
economic opportunities, strengthen 
local talent pipelines, and build 
financial stability and prosperity for rural and low resourced  communities.   
• These regions can become hubs for AI -drive health care innovation, fueling job growth in 
cybersecurity, AI governance, health IT, and bioinformatics.  
• Recruiting and training local talent supports economic resilience and strengthens U.S. 
competitiveness.  
• AI workforce investments create  high -paying sustainable jobs, attract  top talent, and solidify  
the U.S. as a global AI leader.  
• OCHIN  offers a  workforce development program that creates opportunities by leveraging 
flexible, virtual training combined with practical, hands -on job experience.  
o For too long, the main route into health care is with a university degree, but that  is 
massively expensive and time intensive.   
o We offer a lower -cost, more flexible and faster option  to train people with the skills 
they need to succeed in high demand jobs.  
o This means more people –including rural residents living far from universities –can 
access these trainings and obtain jobs in healthcare to support themselves and their 
families .  
o Together, OCHIN and our members collaborate with federal, state and local partners 
to provide market -driven, new health IT , and community health training that will 
transform the health and economies of communities across the country.   
o These skills are critical for preventing and managing chronic disease, driving down 
the cost of care , and achieving greater efficiency in how health care operates .  
 
Harness  Local AI Validation to Strengthen AI Performance and Market Viability  
Recommendation:  Prioritize  investments in learning networks that facilitate  local validation , 
ensuring AI tools perform effectively across deployment settings .  


5 •AI models trained on incomplete or narrow data lead to  inaccuracies, inefficiencies, and
reduced effectiveness –eroding  the potential of AI transformation and global
competitiveness.
•Strong AI development requires robust data and real -world testing  in different operating
environments.
•Local validation ensures AI models are tested under real -word deployment conditions ,
improving accuracy and usability.
•AI models can degrade in performance over time, making ongoing monitoring and
evaluation critical to maintain reliability .
Expand  Cybersecurity Capacity with Non -Profit Health IT Collaboratives  
Recommendation:  Invest  in shared  cybersecurity and AI capacity through non -profit 
collaboratives  while aligning AI, privacy, and cybersecurity frameworks.  
•Non -profit health IT  collaboratives allow  providers in rural and low resourced  communities
to leverage economies of scale , reduce costs , and maintain operational continuity during
crises.
•Supporting shared infrastructure  reduce s duplicative  costs, further  shared learnings, and
drive s rapid cycle learning.
Support  Industry Consensus Standards and Frameworks to Drive  National Uniformity  
Recommendation: Promote  a stakeholder -driven consensus -based approach to AI digital data,  
cybersecurity, and privacy standards while streamlining regulatory processes.  
•A nationally coordinated, industry -led approach to digital data , cybersecurity, and privacy
standards is critical for AI adoption  in health  care .
•Conflicting federal and state regulations create a fragmented systems that slows innovation,
increases compliance burdens, and weakens AI competitiveness.
•Without a harmonized framework, providers –especially  in rural and low resourced
communities –face unnecessary barriers to AI adoption due to inconsistent  digital data,
cybersecurity, and privacy requirements.
•Championin g national standards , such as the U.S. Code Data for Interoperability (USCDI) , to
drive data standardization , eliminate s roadblocks that stifle innovation.
•Supporting initiatives that leverage the leadership of industry  like the CISA Health Sector
Coordinating Council (HSCC), which develops scalable, health -specific cybersecurity
frameworks tailored to the needs of providers in rural and low resourced  communities .
Incorporate a Risk-based Approach  to AI Regulation in Health Care  
Recommendation:  Adopt recommendations for a risk -based approach in regulating AI in the 
health care sector  to balance innovation with patient safety . 
•AI oversight in health  care specifically should align with three factors:
oTransparency:  Clear documentation of model development, data resources, risk
mitigation, and performance


6 oIntended Use  and Conditions of Deployment : Identify  AI functions whether
administrative, research, or clinical decision -making  and where these will be
deployed .
oLevel of autonomy:  Determ ine level of human oversight, from in the loop, on the
loop, or out of the loop.
•Autonomous AI used in clinical decision -making (e.g., diagnostics, predictive analysis) that
lacks transparency requires greater oversight than administrative or research applications
that are assistive or augmentative and that are fully transparent, for example .
•A tiered regulatory approach ensures appropriate oversight for high -risk AI without
overburdening low -risk applications.
•It should also include  clear AI risk classifications, cross -agency regulatory alignment, local
real-world validation init iatives, and incentives for safety -by-design principles to balance
patient safety with AI advancement .
CONCLUSION  
America’s AI future depends on secure, modern infrastructure and strategic investment in rural 
and low resourced  communities.  By advancing AI -drive modernization, strengthening 
cybersecurity, and expanding workforce development, we can enhance economic growth, 
improve health care, and ensure the nation remains at the forefront of AI innovation. We urge 
the Administration to consider these recommendations for inclusion in its Plan and take 
deci sive action to equip these communities with the tools and resources needed to fully 
participate in and benefit from AI advancements.
