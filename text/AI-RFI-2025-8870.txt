General Comment
I am  a creative and professional writer who works in healthcare. I disapprove of “generative AI” technologies stealing and profiting from
m y work without com pensating m e. Generative AI takes m y words and regurgitates them , often sharing incorrect inform ation and directly
harm ing innocent people with their m isinform ation. In addition this directly harm s creatives and professionals such as m yself who
authentically create our own work. There m ust be guardrails in place to protect the work and wellbeing of hum an writers and
com pensating us for our tim e and expertise. The current iteration of Generative AI that exists without respecting the work of the creators
they depend on is im m oral and it should be illegal. The governm ent should be protecting us and not the harm ful generative AI technology
that steals our work from  us.
