General Comment
AI com panies (Google, OpenAI, & the like) are being disingenuous when it com es to the use of GEN AI. They're trying to instill fear
about China gaining an advantage over the US painting it as a "national security" m atter when in reality they're intending to use the
application of copyright laws for their own lucrative purposes. Regulate the m onetization of generative AI, tell everyone, no one is legally
allowed to m onetize the use of AI or m onetize anything produced/generated with AI and you will see that it wasn't really an issue of
"national security" for them  at all.
