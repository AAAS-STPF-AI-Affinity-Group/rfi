General Comment
No no no and please no. Do not let copyrighted m aterial be used to feed AI (without com pensation). This is just stealing. If I feed enough
of your work into the AIs being developed today, the AI can eventually produce som ething sim ilar to yours, but it would not have been
able to do so without your work. This is com m ercial use and should be com pensated. Do not let the m akers of AI rob creative producers
blind. This is com pletely against the public good. It will drive creators out of work and deprive the rest of us of the fruits of the works they
would have m ade.
