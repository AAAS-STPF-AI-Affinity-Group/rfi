General Comment
Artificial intelligence has already affected so m any people within and without the creative sphere that these regulations have becom e
unfortunately necessary in a world riddled with scam m ers and grifters and other people willing to use artificial intelligence to cheat the
system . I'm  afraid that, as a creative person and a friend of creative people that their livelihoods will be negatibely effected by this
procedure, and I hope that they can still live in a world that values hum an creativity and talent over what's fastest and what m akes the m ost
m oney. If these regulations truly are going to dissolve, then you have opened pandora's box, filled with nothing, but people who want it
again, the system  and screw over people who actually care about what they're m aking. I beg of you. Please do not take away that
experience from  the world
