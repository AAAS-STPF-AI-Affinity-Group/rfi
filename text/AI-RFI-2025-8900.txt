General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States, because AI steals from  the livelihoods of m any Am ericans in the
creative industries and profits from  legal theft. Not only is this unethical, illegal under current copyright laws, and im m oral, but this is a fast
track to collapsing the Am erican econom y by destroying hundreds of thousands to m illions of Am erican jobs in the creative industries,
som e of which Am erica is known for like Hollywood. Protect hum an art!
