General Comment
Do not invalidate standing copyright law in order to allow developm ent of AI. The notion of allowing unfettered access to data without
reim bursem ent to the holder of the copyright flies in the face of all long-standing tradition in the US. If these item s are necessary to
continue developm ent, then the com pany should pay for access to the data. 20 years ago people were being sued for hundreds of
thousands of dollars for distributing m usic files; to allow a private com pany to take orders of m agnitude works of art and literature is
unconscionable.
