Artificial intelligence technologies have the capacity to improve human civilization and life if they 
are created and used responsibly, but pose serious risks should they go awry, including dictatorship 
and extreme socioeconomic inequality. To ensure we re ap the benefits of these technologies rather 
than suffer their drawbacks, the United States must take significant action to ensure all artificial 
intelligence technologies are developed, tested, and used in a manner consistent with the 
principles of open -source technology. Such measures include: - Strengthening the rights of 
copyright holders to decide if, when, and how their property is used for the purposes of training 
artificial intelligence models, allowing for business -crushing penalties to be levied a gainst artificial 
intelligence companies should these rules be violated. - Prohibiting Federal funds from being used 
for the purpose of developing or implementing any closed -source artificial intelligence 
technologies, including for the purposes of "defens e" or "national security". - Declaring non -
disclosure agreements and other measures used to silence employees of artificial intelligence 
companies void as contrary to public policy, including those which restrict or prohibit employees 
from releasing "confi dential" intellectual property to the People such that it cannot be monopolized 
and abused. - Prohibit artificial intelligence companies who have recently been found to have 
infringed the intellectual property rights of content creators from taking legal a ction against others 
on the basis of intellectual property theft (e.g., suing a competitor who recently released a more 
energy-efficient large language model) If used properly, artificial intelligence technologies will 
improve our lives and strengthen the power of the People to defend our rights. If abused, artificial 
intelligence technologies will exacerbate income inequality, impede our democratic political 
systems, and strengthen the power of the wealthy few to unilaterally control the ideas and directio n 
of society. For these reasons, it is imperative that swift, decisive action is taken to ensure artificial 
intelligence technologies become (and remain) open source. Note: "open source" includes the 
principles of "libre" and "gratis" as traditionally unde rstood within the open source community.
