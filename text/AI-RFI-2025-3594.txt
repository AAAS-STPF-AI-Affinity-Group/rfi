General Comment
Generative AI is a useless, expensive, wasteful product that brings nothing to the nation or world, and will actually *im pede* hum an
flourishing if it is allowed to continue existing.
The best approach to generative AI would be for it stop existing entirely. If it does continue to exist, it ABSOLUTELY *m ust not* be
built using the stolen work of actual hum ans. That is non-negotiable. 
Large Learning Models have uses in data analysis that are im portant for science, health, and national defense. Even so, these m odels m ust
be tailored to extrem ely narrow specifications and param eters, and m ust not use stolen data as part of their function.
Generative AI is worthless and should be destroyed for the well-being of all hum ans.
