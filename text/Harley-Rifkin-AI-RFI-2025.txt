AI cannot be allowed to train on copyrighted material. It would be the same thing as a human
plagiarizing a school paper. It will also become even harder to detect a "deep fake" photo orvideo, and there is enough fake news out there to begin with.
 
Not only that, but it has the potential to take people's jobs away, replacing them withmachines.
 
Thank you.
