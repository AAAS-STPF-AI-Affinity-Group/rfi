Subject: Response to RFI on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan  
To Whom It May Concern:  
On behalf of the Middle East Institute (MEI), we are pleased to respond to the National Science 
Foundation's (NSF) and Office of Science and Technology Policy's (OSTP) request for information 
(RFI) regarding the "Development of an Artificial Intelligence A ction Plan." MEI acknowledges the 
pivotal role of AI in shaping global technology and geopolitics, and we commend the Trump 
Administration for its dedication to ensuring American leadership in this transformative domain.  
In support of the objectives set forth in Executive Order (EO) 14179, MEI offers the following 
recommendations to solidify the United States' position as the global leader in AI innovation while 
addressing critical ethical, regulatory, and infrastructural imperatives. Our recommendations 
emphasize five strategic priorities:  
●Regulations and Export Controls:  MEI suggests an AI governance framework that
balances innovation and security. It would use a Tier 1.5 classification to boost partnerships
with rising AI powers (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE). This framework builds on
the AI Diffusion Framework  for standards and cooperation.
●Energy and Infrastructure:  MEI urges energy policy reform to meet AI’s energy needs,
modernizing NEPA for faster clean energy approvals (e.g., geothermal, nuclear, solar). We
also propose Innovation Zones in states such as Nevada, Texas, and Arizona with pre -
approved permits to spe ed up AI data center deployment.
●Research and Development (R&D):  MEI calls for sustained R&D investment to lead in AI,
including a National AI Research Institute for Third Wave AI (machine learning + symbolic
reasoning). We seek stronger government -industry-academia collaboration.
●AI Systems and Governance:  MEI supports policies for AI accuracy, explainability, and
adaptability, prioritizing autonomous, real -time learning AI to address global challenges and
reduce biases.


These recommendations reflect MEI's comprehensive approach to AI development, designed to 
counter global competitors, notably China, while fostering an environment of innovation and ethical 
stewardship.  
We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this vital initiative and welcome further 
engagement with the administration to promote a responsible and visionary AI policy framework.

Executive Summary:  
The Middle East Institute (MEI) presents a comprehensive proposal for a national strategy 
designed to secure and enhance the United States' leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). As 
global competition intensifies, particularly with China’s advancement s, the U.S. faces significant 
challenges in maintaining its position at the forefront of AI development. This proposal, 
grounded in the objectives outlined in Executive Order (EO) 14179, aims to ensure that the U.S. 
continues to lead in AI innovation while  addressing ethical, regulatory, and infrastructure 
challenges. MEI’s recommendations reflect a holistic approach to AI development that spans 
energy, infrastructure, research and development, and global governance.  
Key Policy Areas and Recommendations  
1.Regulations and Export Controls :
MEI advocates for the creation of a Tier 1.5 classification that recognizes the growing
strategic partnership between the United States and Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia,
Qatar, and the UAE. This would accommodate their increasing role in global AI
development while addressing national security concerns. The proposed framework
would balance innovation with security, ensuring continued collaboration on AI
governance, development, and export without sacrificing the guardra ils imposed by Tier
2. By building on the existing AI Diffusion Framework, this approach would strengthen
U.S.-Gulf cooperation, foster common AI standards, and enhance the global
competitiveness of both regions.
2.Energy and Infrastructure :
MEI stresses the importance of reforming energy and infrastructure policies to support
the vast energy requirements of AI. The U.S. must modernize the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to streamline approvals for clean energy projects,
such as geoth ermal, modular nuclear, and solar power, to fuel AI data centers.


Additionally, MEI advocates for the creation of Innovation Zones  in strategic locations 
like Nevada, Texas, and Arizona. These zones would house AI data center clusters, with 
pre-approved permits to minimize bureaucratic delays and accelerate AI deployment.  
3.Research and Development (R&D) :
To maintain global AI leadership, MEI recommends an aggressive, long -term investment
in AI R&D. This includes the establishment of a National AI Research Institute ,
focused on advancing Third Wave AI —a hybrid approach combining machine learning
with symbolic reasoning. This will ensure that AI systems are not only more effective but
also more explainable and reliable, particularly in critical sectors like healthcare. MEI
also supports increased collab oration between governmen t agencies, the private sector,
and academic institutions to drive high -risk, high -reward AI research.
4.AI Systems and Governance :
To ensure that AI systems remain unbiased and socially responsible, MEI recommends
policy actions focused on improving the factual accuracy, explainability, robustness, and
adaptability of AI models. The U.S. must prioritize developing AI systems that ar e
intellectually autonomous, capable of real -time learning, and able to address complex
global challenges. This approach will mitigate the risk of ideological biases and ensure
that AI technologies are developed with an eye toward long-term societal benefits.
Introduction  
The global race for AI leadership is intensifying, with the United States and China as the primary 
competitors vying for dominance in this transformative technology. As the geopolitical and 
economic stakes rise, the U.S. must reassess its approach to AI to  ensure its continued leadership 
and safeguard its strategic interests. At the same time, AI presents unprecedented opportunities 
for global cooperation, innovation, and societal advancement. The MEI recognizes that AI is not 
just a technological challenge —it is a geopolitical one, with implications that extend far beyond 
national borders.  
In light of this, MEI presents this report as a strategic framework for the United States to 
maintain its technological edge in AI while addressing the growing influence of China and other 
global competitors. The U.S. must align its AI policies with nation al security interests, economic 
goals, and ethical standards to stay ahead in the global competition. This report examines key 
areas of action that the U.S. must take to secure its AI future, including investments in 
infrastructure, research, and regulator y frameworks.  
Drawing on insights from experts and leaders in the field, the report explores the intersections of 
AI, geopolitics, and global governance. It offers recommendations for fostering international 


collaboration, advancing AI research, and ensuring that the development of AI is aligned with 
American values and interests. As AI continues to shape the future of technology, defense, 
economy, and society, the U.S. must act decisively and strategically to  ensure that it remains the 
global leader in AI innovation and governance.  
Background to Policy Action  
EO 14179 puts forward its directives during a time of upward momentum for the AI industry. 
The technology is widely seen to be in a critical period of development, marked by capability 
improvements that will translate into one of the pillars of twenty -first-century power. This period 
is defined by the prevalence of Generative Pre -Trained Transformers (GPT) capable of 
producing coherent and plausible natural language text in addition to images, audio, and video.  
A result of this perception is the increasing orientation in policy circles toward the achievement 
of “Artificial General Intelligence,” or AGI. For example, the U.S. -China Economic and Security 
Review Commission, in its 2024 annual report to the U.S. Cong ress, notably recommended that  
Congress establish and fund a Manhattan Project -like program dedicated to racing to 
and acquiring an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capability…defined as systems 
that are as good as or better than human capabilities across all cognitive domains and 
would usurp the sharpest human minds at every task.1 
The effort to achieve AGI, so defined, is bound up in computing infrastructure needs. In this 
vein, President Trump announced on January 21, 2025 a joint venture dubbed “Stargate” 
undertaken by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle to build out at least $100 billio n in AI 
infrastructure, with up to $500 billion over four years.2 The announcement follows a now -
solidified association between computing infrastructure and AI development and deployment, 
including a project by the same name launched by Microsoft and OpenAI in 2024.3

The technical achievements, current limitations, and realistic trajectories of state -of-the-art AI 
models are best conceived in relation to the history of the technology’s development. The 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) usefully provided  just such a 
conception:4 a “First Wave” characterized by models that leveraged handcrafted knowledge , 
known as rule -based or Symbolic AI, that dominated in the mid -to-late twentieth century; a 
“Second Wave” that spawned the Deep Learning Revolution and which oversaw the ascendance 
of artificial neural networks  that learn through statistical associations of data; and an anticipated 
“Third Wave” that mitigates or resolves some fundamental shortcomings of AI models by 
targeting their data -greediness, limited novelty -adaptation, and ability to deliver performance 
guarantees.5  
One notable disjuncture between the First and Second Waves is the role of government. The 
Second Wave has seen the private sector leading the development of AI models that learn 
through data and achieve the marvelous approximation of higher -order human cog nitive abilities. 
This is most prominent through the recent ‘reasoning’ models from AI labs at OpenAI,6 Google,7 
and xAI.8 Private industry has thus pioneered and built out the Second Wave, following the U.S. 
government’s support for the First Wave of AI and computing research in the twentieth century.9 
Another disjuncture is less appreciated: a shift from the original meanings of “AGI” imbued by 
the term’s expositors in the 2000s and its dominant meanings today. The original expositors 
emphasized the ability of a system to autonomously and incrementally learn over its lifecycle, 
including through interactions with living and non -living entities in its environment.10 The sheer 
difficulty of the problems posed by this conception of AGI – and the need to introduce the term 
at all – was an indication that the field re -oriented at some point between the First and Second

Waves; that is, the goal of machine intelligence “shifted from having internal intelligence to 
utilizing external intelligence (the programmer’s intelligence) to solve particular problems.”11  
Nevertheless, America dominated the First and Second Waves. It can and should dominate the 
Third Wave. Some researchers promote Neuro -Symbolic AI –a melding of Symbolic and 
Machine Learning –as the ideal candidate for the Third Wave.12 
Yet, AI dominance is not merely a matter of basic R&D. Dominance in the AI competition 
depends on a state’s ability to wind its way up a chain from basic R&D to scalable commercial 
and defense applications, to the regulation of the flow of hardware and mod els across borders. 
Throughout, critical infrastructure providing the energy to power data centers and other AI -
enabling facilities and designating the appropriate land on which to build them is vital.  
Our recommendations thus take stock of the progress made in AI and chart a course for the 
future of American AI dominance. Consistent with our expansive conception of AI supremacy,13 
we propose that America recognize the strategic importance of U.S. -Gulf relations in regulating 
the export of specialized hardware and models within the Diffusion Framework, the imperative 
of energy and infrastructure reforms to scaffold the country’s tec hnological ambitions, and the 
long-term importance of laying the groundwork for the Third Wave of AI.  
Policy Recommendations  
Regulations and Export Controls : 
1.Revise the Diffusion Framework by introducing Tier 1.5 classification, which would
expand the sphere of states favorable to U.S. AI and related technology interests that are
currently allowed within the Tier system. Additionally, reduce the stringency of
computing capacity restrictions imposed on American firms for commercial reach.
The Diffusion Framework, dividing the world into blocs of states more and less aligned 
with the U.S., recognizes the importance of restricting the malign and adversarial uses of 
American AI models and enabling hardware. That said, the exclusivity of its Ti er 1 
ranking, and the concomitant computing capacity export restrictions associated with its 
Tier 2 ranking, comes at the expense of a broader conception of AI supremacy. The

Diffusion Framework, as currently defined, seeks to lock in American dominance over 
the technical dimensions of its AI leadership yet limits the reach of its commercial AI 
exports,14 in this way reducing the scope of American AI dominance.  
We, therefore, propose a Tier 1.5 classification to enhance AI collaboration while 
ensuring security. Tier 1.5 is designed as an intermediate category between Tier 1 
(United States and Key Partners) and Tier 2 (Controlled -Access Countries). It offers 
greater access to AI hardware and large language models (LLMs) than Tier 2, while 
maintaining robust security and non -proliferation controls to prevent technology leakage 
to adversaries like China. This balance makes the U.S. a more attractive partner by 
meeting the technological ambitions of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, fostering strategic 
partnerships, and reducing the appeal of China's less restrictive offerings.  
●Enhanced Access : Provides up to 200,000 H100 -equivalent AI chips  annually
(double Tier 2's 100,000) and supports LLMs with up to 100 billion parameters ,
with small exports of 5,000 H100 -eq exempt from individual authorization.
●Inclusion Criteria : Requires security cooperation agreements  and non-
proliferation guarantees  to align countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia with U.S.
interests and block tech leakage to Tier 3 nations.
●Joint Programs and Audits : Enforces joint U.S. R&D programs  and quarterly
audits by a joint oversight committee to ensure compliance and prevent technology
diversion.
●Enhanced Security Measures : Mandates biometric access controls  for AI facilities
and end-to-end encryption  for data, offering U.S. research grants as incentives for
compliance.
●Strategic Advantages Over China : Delivers long -term partnerships, economic
benefits, and a potential Tier 1 pathway, positioning U.S. tech as a secure, superior
alternative to China’s offerings.
2.The Secretary of the Department of Commerce should task the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) with formulating recommendations on AI capability
metrics beyond computational operations and computing capacity that are tailored for
the Third Wave.
The force of the U.S.’s export control framework on AI and related technologies today 
rests in large part on the advancement of capabilities in tandem with increases in 
computing power. The Third Wave could see AI models of a sufficiently different nature 
14 See, e.g., Brad Smith. (February 27, 2025). The Trump Administration Can Avoid a Strategic 
Misstep in the AI Global Race. Microsoft , https://blogs.microsoft.com/on -the-
issues/2025/02/27/trump -administration -ai-global-race/.  


to the models of fascination today that they render the metrics used to evaluate 
capabilities ineffective. We should, indeed, expect algorithmic and architectural changes 
in the coupling of Symbolic AI and Machine Learning (First and Second Wave AI), 
though in unexpected ways.15 There is thus a need for the Commerce Department to 
instruct NIST to formulate recommendations on AI capability metrics that are geared to 
other possible AI futures.  
Energy and Infrastructure : 
1.Reform of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to expedite approvals for
geothermal, modular nuclear, and next -gen solar projects would ensure reliable, clean
power.
Energy infrastructure permitting must keep apace with the vast energy resources to be
consumed by AI -relevant infrastructure, including data centers, which could consume
between 4.6% and 9.1% of U.S. electricity by 2030, up from an estimated 4% in 2024.16
2.Create “Innovation Zones” for advanced infrastructure, including the designation of
federal lands in states like Nevada, Texas, or Arizona for integrated AI data center
clusters powered by on -site geothermal/small modular reactors (SMRs). Pre -approve
permits to bypass local grid bottlenecks.
The U.S. Departments of Energy and Defense were instructed to identify suitable lands
for leasing to private entities for data center buildouts in early 2025.17 Moreover,
President Trump indicated the use of “emergency declarations” to accelerate datacenter
constructions during the Stargate announcement.18 Such designations are critical.
15 There is also doubt as to whether the substrates on which AI is currently built are the only ones 
possible, or even ideal. See, Luke Gbedemah and Kevin Allison. (February 18, 2025). The Post -

3.Invest in Space -based Solar Power (SBSP) demonstrations and in -orbit infrastructure
build-outs through NASA and DARPA to capture the full range of AI -relevant and
strategically sensitive sources of energy.
The relationship between AI and space -based infrastructure is underappreciated.
Hardening the link between the two is increasing in importance within areas such as
Space Situational Awareness (SSA) (where AI can be used to monitor in -orbit traffic),
autonomy of operations in earth’s orbit, and the strate gic dimensions born of these new
capabilities (including threat detection).
We target space -based energy generation here given the importance of its underlying 
infrastructure build -out for this link to mature over time. SBSP, which would beam clean 
energy from space, is one such source.19 Notably, America’s chief rival, China, has 
committed $500 million to its Zhuri SBSP technology by 2030 with the ultimate aim of 
building a 10 MW station by 2035. Serving as a proxy for advancements in supporting 
and adjacent technologies, including wirele ss power transmission and robotics, such 
investment would help firm up America’s energy needs.  
Research and Development:  
1.The National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office (NAIIO) and the Subcommittee on
Machine Learning and AI should instruct the Federal AI R&D Interagency Working
Group (IWG) to make a long -term investment in DARPA’s basic and applied Neuro -
Symbolic res earch.
The federal AI R&D IWG is a coordination body20 serving the U.S.’s strategic AI R&D 
objectives. The IWG itself is overseen by two separate bodies housed within the 
Executive Branch: the NAIIO and the Subcommittee on Machine Learning and AI.  
DARPA is a participating agency within this IWG,21 with its Assured Neuro Symbolic 
Learning and Reasoning program supported as part of the IWG’s strategic priority to

ensure the safety and security of AI systems.22 This work is an early example of Third 
Wave AI research falling under the banner of Neuro -Symbolic AI. Defense research in 
Third Wave AI should be expanded, building out from beyond the focus on safety and 
security in basic and applied Neuro -Symbolic rese arch. The IWG should make an 
additional long -term investment accordingly.  
2.The National Science Foundation should establish a National AI Research Institute
dedicated to developing factually accurate, explainable, and reliable Neuro -Symbolic
algorithms that support critical clinical applications.
The establishment of an Institute for Neuro -Symbolic AI research must fund both 
foundational and use -inspired research that is high -risk and high -reward.23 It must also 
target select areas for policy action. We thus set our sights on algorithms and 
architectures that support clinical applications in healthcare environments, in this way 
targeting deficiencies including factual accuracy, explainability, reliab ility, and meta -
cognition while entrenching U.S. frontier AI research in a critical sector.24  
Clinical applications are not only ideally situated to serve as foils for this end, but Neuro -
Symbolic research is already pursued in this vein in tandem with the AI Institutes. 
Indeed, in a special issue on the Institutes by AI Magazine  in 2024, researchers Manas 
Gaur and Amit Sheth argue that LLMs have not risen to the level of “inherently 
trustworthy” and their generative outputs cannot be relied upon in healthcare settings 
without grounding in factual clinical knowledge and practice g uidelines.25 They therefore 
argue for Neuro -Symbolic systems that “seamlessly blend the powerful approximating 
capabilities of neural networks with trustworthy symbolic knowledge.”26 
22 Ibid., p. 30.  
23 The Institutes are geared towards use-inspired research for domain -specific applications where 
current approaches fall short. They are encouraged to make and plan for  long-term research 
projects. James J. Donlon. (2024). The National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes 
Program and Its Significance to a Prosperous Future. AI Magazine , 45(1), p. 6-8. 
https://doi.org/10.1002/aaai.12153 . They also pursue complementarity with the private sector, 
taking on “high -risk, high -reward projects” that the latter deems too risky yet possess Institute -
specific public -private partnerships and research “alliances.” Ibid., p. 11.  
24 Neuro-Symbolic research links the algorithmic - and application -levels. Much as humans 
automatically perceive environments and exert deliberate cognitive control over them (e.g., long -
term planning), AI -enabled systems should adhere to similar principles, for which Symbolic AI 
and Machine Learning are usefully melded. See, e.g., Sheth, A., Roy, K., and Gaur, M. (2023).

3.Leverage domestic and international partnerships between scientific institutions and
private organizations to engineer open -source methods that independently develop
compute- and data-efficient methods for state -of-the-art performance. Consider
establishin g a national computational reserve that allocates resources to this end.
The release of DeepSeek -R1, developed by Chinese firm DeepSeek, sparked major
debate over closed -source and open -source models. The debate owed in part to
DeepSeek’s publication of their methods detailing the model’s construction.27
Debate should overlook the fact that OpenAI developed its o1 model, demonstrating that
the relevant post -training techniques over a pre -trained language model provide
capability improvements of no small measure, thereby allowing DeepSeek to more
efficiently target and allocate its own computational resources in the search of
independent techniques to produce its ‘reasoning’ model.
A leader in AI will complement proprietary state -of-the-art models with incentives for the
development of open -source models that engineer comparatively compute - and data-
efficient techniques while reproducing or approximating state -of-the-art capabilities . The
U.S should leverage partnerships between scientific institutions and corporate
organizations to this end, somewhat emulating OpenAI’s February 2025 “jam session”28
with US national labs with an open -source bent.
Additionally, the U.S. should consider a variant of a recommendation to establish a 
national computational reserve29 from which open -source researchers can draw resources 
for this work. Rather than a one -size-fits-all approach, however, this reserve should 
allocate resources tailored to compute - and data-efficient ends.  
Ensuring U.S. Leadership in the Global AI Race  
As the U.S. continues its leadership role in the rapidly advancing world of AI, it is critical to act 
swiftly and strategically to address the regulatory, infrastructural, and technical challenges that 
lie ahead. The stakes of this competition are not just  economic but geopolitical, with the potential 
to redefine global power structures. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this

report, the U.S. can maintain its dominance in AI while safeguarding its values, ethical 
standards, and national security interests.  
The proposals to regulate the flow of hardware and models, reform energy infrastructure, and 
enhance AI research and development are foundational to building a sustainable and innovative 
AI ecosystem. By creating Innovation Zones and advancing Third Wave A I, the U.S. can foster 
an environment that supports the next generation of AI models, while ensuring their application 
remains transparent and free from bias. In the face of China's aggressive AI strategy, the U.S. 
must also focus on international cooperat ion, securing its technological advantages through 
careful regulation and strategic partnerships with allied nations. Moreover, enhancing export 
control frameworks and developing robust AI capability metrics will ensure that the U.S. retains 
control over c ritical technologies and prevents adversaries from gaining a competitive edge.  
Ultimately, the future of AI will be determined by those who can innovate faster, deploy more 
effectively, lay the groundwork for the future. The U.S. has the opportunity to shape this future, 
but it must act now to secure its position as the global leader  in AI. Through bold investments in 
infrastructure, research, and international collaboration, the U.S. can ensure that it continues to 
lead the world in the AI race and remains a beacon of technological and democratic values.
