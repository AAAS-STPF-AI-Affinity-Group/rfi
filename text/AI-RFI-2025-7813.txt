General Comment
Destroying copyright law to ensure com panies building large language m odels don't have to pay for the content used to train them  is
abhorrent. LLMs are already being replaced with better, m ore accurate, sm aller m odels that don't rely on theft. Allowing com panies to
steal work is obscene and this proposal is appalling.
