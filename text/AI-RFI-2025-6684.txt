General Comment
The integration of AI into nearly every product and service has not yielded any appreciable gains to the general Am erican public. AI is an
expensive, often-flawed, narrow-use-case technology that m ust steal user and creative data to sustain growth and self-perpetuation.
Generative AI is already been shown to de-skill students and professionals that rely on it, allowing their critical thinking skills to atrophy.
Even Microsoft has scaled down their resource spend and outlook on AI technology. At-scale adoption of AI in Am erican education,
governm ent, and business will cripple each of those sectors in the long run.
