The plan as suggested essentially removes all copyright protections for every piece ever
created in direct opposition to copyright law. Essentially a few corporations will own theexclusive use of all works created and protected under US law. This will lead to direct andirreparable harm to the US economy.
 
If AI corporations are allowed unrestricted use of copyrighted material, be it written, visual,audio or other, they must fairly compensate the copyright holders from gross proceeds of allAI generated works. Essentially, the AI corporation must transfer 100% of all revenue to thecopyright holder. Anything less is tantamount to copyright infringement and theft.
 
As an example, then entirety of President Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal” could beingested and used to produce a nearly identical work for profit with no proceeds going to theoriginal author.
 
Thank you for your consideration and rejection of this AI plan.
