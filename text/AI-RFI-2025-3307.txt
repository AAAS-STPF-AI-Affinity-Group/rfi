General Comment
Losening restrictions on the privacy of data used to train AI m odels is a direct threat to both global brand integrity and security. No m atter
what restrictions are placed onto an AI m odel the inherent black box nature of its processing leads to m any potential breaches into
sensitive data the m odel m ight store. The only way to secure data used by an AI m odel is to not let it access it in the first place. Even less
sensitive data like branding allows the potential of dam aging the brand identity without consequences due to the m uddy nature of
ownership of AI generated m aterial. The best way to ensure the security and integrity of private and copyrighted data is restricting the
access of AI m odels to that data. Any policy allowing such data to be processed for m achine learning processes m ay lead to m ore
powerful AI but that power will certainly be used to expose and devalue the data the AI was trained with. China already seeks to devalue
m any Am erican brands and products by m aking cheap knock offs, let's not m ake it easier for them  to continue that.
