I. Executive Summary
The American Chamber of Commerce in Portugal appreciates the opportunity to provide its
comments in response to the Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan issued by the Networking and Information Technology Research and 
Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office (NCO) on behalf of the Office of Science 
and Technology Policy (OSTP), regarding priority actions that should be included in that AI Action 
Plan. 
The American Chamber of Commerce in Portugal (“AmCham Portugal”)  is the largest 
bilateral business association between Portugal and the United States,1 and its mission is to develop 
and facilitate economic and commercial relations between the two countries on a basis of mutual 
interest. Amongst its focus  areas are “Technology and Innovation” and an “A.I., Data and 
Cybersecurity”.2 
AmCham Portugal  supports the United States’ efforts and endeavours to safeguard national 
security interests and U.S. technology leadership, particularly in the AI sector. However, AmCham 
Portugal  is concerned  by the classification of Portugal as a Tier 2 country  under current the 
Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion (AI Diffusion Rule),3 published by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at  the end of the prior 
administration , as it  may significantly harm the ability of U.S. Technology and Data Center 
Companies (many of which are AmCham Portugal’s members) to export technology services and 
advanced compute to Portugal, and hence prevent the diffusion of U.S. AI globally.

2Leaving  Portugal  out  of  Tier  1  will  impede  U.S.  investments  in  the  country, 
particularly in digital services and the associated digital infrastructure, and hence AmCham 
Portugal’s ability to foster a conducive environment for U.S. businesses in Portugal. Such 
designation will limit opportunities for innovation, partnerships and investments in critical digital 
sectors, and hence weaken U.S. influence in key global markets, including in Portugal .
AmCham also believes that the designation of Portugal as a Tier 2 country is unjustified, 
considering that the country provides strong safeguards against threats from “ malicious actors”4 
that could be seeking to “engage in activities that pose profound risks to U.S. national security and 
foreign policy.”5
Our comments outline:
1.The economic and strategic disadvantages of Portugal’s Tier 2 classification under
the AI Diffusion Rule.
2.The potential harm to U.S. companies and Portugal’s role as a secure and AI-
friendly hub for U.S. firms.
3.The urgent need for Portugal’s reclassification to Tier 1 to align with its NATO and
EU allies, ensuring AI innovation and investment remain unimpeded.
AmCham Portugal urges U.S. policymakers to reassess Portugal’s classification, 
recognizing its strategic importance and commitment to AI development, while ensuring the 
continued expansion of U.S. technological leadership in Europe .
II. Background
A. Introduction to Amcham Portugal
Established in 1951, AmCham Portugal is a private, independent and non-profit business 
association whose main objective is to develop and facilitate economic and commercial relations 
between Portugal and the USA, on a basis of mutual interest.
With 74 years of existence and approximately 270 members6, it is the largest bilateral 
business association between Portugal and the U.S.
AmCham7 supports American companies based in Portugal and Portuguese companies 
looking to expand into the American market. It acts as a connecting hub for businesses of various 
sizes, sectors, and markets, creating a strong network of business opportunities, information, and 
strategic support.

3Through  its  activities,  AmCham  prioritizes  knowledge-sharing,  idea  exchange,  and 
experience-sharing, while also committing to fostering a favourable business environment that 
promotes investment, competitiveness, entrepreneurship, innovation, and job creation.
AmCham Portugal positions itself as the leading organization for strengthening ties, mutual 
understanding, and collaboration between Portugal and the U.S., contributing to the promotion of 
competitiveness,  productivity,  and  internationalization  of  the  economy  and  businesses  by 
encouraging investment and trade between the two countries.
Additionally, AmCham promotes the exchange of knowledge, technology, innovation, 
talent,  and  best  business  practices  within  an  entrepreneurial  and  innovation-driven  culture. 
Notably, AmCham Portugal’s members include major U.S. Technology companies, all of which 
have a well-established presence in Portugal. Their interests are primarily addressed through two 
specialized committees, including a “Technology and innovation” committee and an “A.I., Data 
and Cybersecurity” committee.
III. Comment 1: Restricted AI Infrastructure Deployment and Economic Losses  
The AI Diffusion Rule’s Tier 2 classification of Portugal directly contradicts U.S. strategic
and economic objectives in Europe. By limiting Portugal’s access to advanced AI technologies, the 
U.S. risks weakening its own companies’ ability to expand in a secure and AI-friendly jurisdiction. 
Most major U.S. Technology Companies, and members of AmCham Portugal, have significant 
presences in Portugal and provide services and products in the country. In addition, all major AI 
data center operations in Portugal are U.S.-owned or controlled, yet the current restrictions prevent 
these companies from scaling their infrastructure to meet global AI demand.
Portugal plays a critical role in U.S. data security, acting as a key node in U.S.-led subsea 
cable networks, including the Google Nuvem cable linking South Carolina via the Azores. This 
direct and secure connection not only provides the U.S. industry with a much more geographically 
secure location from potential subsea cable interference, but this this geographic security is also 
supported by Portugal’s commitment to ensuring the security of subsea cable networks. Ensuring 
continued  AI  infrastructure  expansion  in  Portugal  directly  benefits  U.S.  data  security  and 
redundancy efforts, enhancing the resilience of transatlantic digital communications. Additionally, 
Portugal’s geopolitical alignment as a founding NATO member, a host to key U.S. military 
installations, and one of the most stable and reliable U.S. allies in Europe underscores the 
inconsistency of placing the country in Tier 2. By imposing undue restrictions on Portugal’s AI 
sector, the U.S. is inadvertently limiting its own strategic influence in the region.
IV . Comment 2: Tier 2 Classification Threatens U.S. Investment and AI Competitiveness  
The restrictions imposed by the Tier 2 classification place over $50 billion in projected U.S.
investment in digital infrastructure in Portugal at risk, primarily from American companies looking 
to  expand  AI-driven  digital  infrastructure,  including  data  centers,  in  Europe.  This  includes 
approximately $12 billion applied to the development of infrastructure and an estimated $40 billion 


4in compute investment needed to fully utilize the 1,500 MW AI capacity already planned and 
largely secured in the country.
Beyond direct investment, the Tier 2 designation diminishes Portugal’s viability as a 
strategic hub for U.S. technology firms, diverting investment to Tier 1 European countries with 
fewer restrictions. As a result, American companies that already have or would otherwise establish 
AI operations in Portugal may be forced to shift expansion elsewhere, potentially undermining 
U.S. technology leadership in Europe but most definitely in Portugal, where U.S. Technology and 
Data Center companies are already well invested. The restrictions further disrupt supply chains, 
including inhibiting U.S. supply chains and U.S. job creation, increasing costs for U.S. firms to 
operate and limiting access to advance compute.
By maintaining Portugal in Tier 2, the U.S. is curbing its own ability to foster a strong AI 
ecosystem within a trusted NATO ally, Wassenaar founding member. 8 Portugal is also a long-
standing member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear Suppliers 
Group (NSG), and the Australia Group (AG).9 Moreover, Portugal's dual-use regulations are 
largely in line with those of the United States: Regulation (EU) 2021/821 sets out the EU's export 
control framework, and, similar to the controls implemented by the U.S. and other European Tier 1 
countries, it mandates authorization for the export of specific dual-use items.10 Given Portugal’s 
stability, commitment to data security, and business-friendly environment, this policy choice 
appears unjustified and unnecessarily hampers U.S. technological leadership in Europe, including 
in Portugal.  
V . Comment 3: Restricting Portugal Weakens U.S. AI Leadership in Europe  
Portugal’s Tier 2 classification limits U.S. companies’ ability to leverage a key AI-driven
market, ultimately weakening U.S. leadership in AI infrastructure deployment across Europe. 
Portugal offers a strategic advantage due to its access to renewable energy, a strong cybersecurity 
and compliance framework, and its emerging role as a hub for AI and data processing. Its energy 
market provides abundant, cost-competitive renewable energy, making it an ideal location for U.S. 
technology firms seeking sustainable AI operations. Portugal also ranks at par or above top-tier 
nations in cybersecurity and data protection, ensuring a safe environment for U.S. AI investments.
With a planned data center capacity that could meet up to 10 percent of Europe’s demand by 
2028, Portugal is poised to become a key enabler for advanced AI clusters of U.S. Technology 
Companies. However, maintaining the country in Tier 2 undermines this potential, restricting U.S. 
companies from fully leveraging Portugal’s growing AI infrastructure. This places the U.S. at a

5disadvantage by forcing companies to seek alternative, potentially less strategic locations for their 
AI deployments.
The  U.S.  has  a  vested  interest  in  fostering  AI-friendly  environments  within  stable, 
geopolitically  aligned  countries,  and  Portugal  meets  all  these  criteria.  Restricting  its  AI 
development under the Tier 2 classification is a short-sighted policy that could weaken U.S. 
leadership in the European AI market, reduce its ability to shape the global AI landscape and 
potentially affect its competitiveness in science, technology, engineering and manufacturing.
VI. Conclusion
Amcham Portugal urges U.S. policymakers to reclassify Portugal as Tier 1 under the AI
Diffusion Rule, in line with other EU Member States, and align the tiering with the Trump 
Administration’s foreign policy and national security objectives. The current Tier 2 classification 
undermines U.S. strategic interests, diverts key U.S. AI investments to potentially less secure 
markets, and weakens U.S. leadership in the AI sector. Portugal’s alignment with U.S. security 
priorities, its critical role in transatlantic data infrastructure, and its potential as a European AI hub 
make its inclusion in Tier 1 not only a logical step but a necessary one.
Failure to adjust Portugal’s classification risks significant economic and strategic losses for 
the U.S., including diminished export opportunities by affecting U.S. supply chains and U.S. job 
creation, a weaker presence in Europe’s AI ecosystem, and reduced influence over AI governance 
in a geopolitically significant region. Reclassifying Portugal to Tier 1 will strengthen U.S.-Portugal 
relations, safeguard U.S. technology investments, and ensure the continued expansion of U.S. AI 
leadership in Europe.
