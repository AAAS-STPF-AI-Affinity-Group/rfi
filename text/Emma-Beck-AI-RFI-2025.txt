I believe that this country needs to uphold its copyright laws. OpenAI is not art, and it is not remotely needed or
necessary for anybody. It does nothing but steal already created material from established artists and properties. It isfunctionally useless and is openly defying long-upheld laws that protect the property of many working Americans.American artists work hard to bring entertainment to the American people and they bring billions of dollars to thiscountry. American Art is impactful, important, and a staple of this country's culture. The idea of spitting in the faceof that by letting AI soulessly scrape it for "more content" is utterly shameful. AI does not create, it malignantlytransforms already beloved ideas into grotesque slop that the American people have been repeatedly stating theyheavily dislike and did not ask for. It is a waste of water, money, and time. Uphold our copyright law, keep ourbeautiful ideas and creations safe from this hideous machine. OpenAI challenging copyright law is a destruction tothe foundation that America's art economy is built on. Do not push forward any legislation that changes that.Sent from my iPhone
