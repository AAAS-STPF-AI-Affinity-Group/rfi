General Comment
We do not need this m easure. It is a drastic overreach that puts the rights of corporations above the rights of people. If it were put into the
law the only result would be m ore m oney in the pockets of CEOs and an even harder working environm ent for average people. I saw
m any people lose previously stable jobs when AI gave their bosses an excuse to fire people are use inaccurate, poor-quality tools instead
and produces worse products and depended on the theft of copyrighted m aterial in order to produce those worse products. The
copyrighted m aterial that AI steals has to be better protected to save Am erican jobs and if we all want services and products that work
well and last a long tim e we cannot perm it AI to m ake them , because it does not do that. AI only guesses what the correct answer is and
has been shown over and over to lie, m isrepresent the facts, and lead hum an users astray. More AI stealing from  m ore areas is a recipe
for a worse society with worse products and ideas.
We do not need 'dom inance'. We never needed dom inance. We would have a stronger society if we focused on ensuring quality instead
of being first every tim e. Making the best of anything takes tim e, and we would actually be the best if we slowed down and focused on
m aking this tool right (without theft of IP and without stealing jobs) instead of stealing harder and hoping it works eventually.
