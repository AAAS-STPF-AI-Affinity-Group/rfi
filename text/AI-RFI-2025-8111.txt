General Comment
Do NOT rem ove the few regulations on AI, nor let AI cooperations just ignore copyright. This will hurt everyone, but it will hurt sm all
creators the m ost!! 
Genuinely, Disney can always pum p out a m ediocre m ovie and m ake m illions. A YouTube starting off will have no chance against a team
who all vet AI slop and produce m ultiple videos away, not even considering that AI has targeted children, and the effects on a constant
stream  of nonsense colors and undefinable characters can only turn out horribly for Am erica's future.
