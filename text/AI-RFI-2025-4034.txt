General Comment
Sarcastically: I really love reading articles where I’m  learning som ething, but all the im ages and text are inaccurate due to being AI
generated.
You’re going to cause m ore m isinform ation and your kids are not going to know the differences between truth and fake. People are losing
their jobs to ai. As an artist I’m  seeing first hand the decim ation it’s doing to our financial stability and the way we interact online. AiGen is
causing social platform s to burst at the seam s with false inform ation and im ages that m ean absolutely nothing. Once you allow this scraping
to go further you’ll start unearthing m ore confidential inform ation and I’m  certain it will disrupt the trust you have with US citizens and
other countries. People losing their jobs to AI are not being cared for and you are abandoning your own citizens. There will m ore chaos
besides a couple of teslas on fire if this passes.
