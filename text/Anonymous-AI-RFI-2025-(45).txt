What the market is currently calling AI is only a sophisticated large language model. It cannot
innovate. It should never be used for anything that affects the lives of anyone for better orworse, and AI companies should not be allowed to scrape copyrighted work.
Be smart about this, recognize AI has a long way to go before it has valid use-cases in decision
chains, and at the moment it's simply burning up electrical energy to no useful end.
