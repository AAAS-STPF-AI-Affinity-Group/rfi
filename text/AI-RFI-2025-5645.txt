General Comment
I do not believe that GenAI has any place in the US governm ent. Allowing it to scrape unfettered will have so m any third and forth order
effects not lim ited to m aking due legal process m ore difficult, it will open the doors to generated evidence and endanger so m any people's
livelyhoods all in the favor of a bottom  line. It is anti-hum an.
