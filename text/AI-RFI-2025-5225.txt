General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to have unlim ited access to copyright m aterial would hurt all Am erican artists from  independents to m ulti-billion
dollar com panies by stealing from  everyone. Mircosoft is already pulling back from  leasing as m any data centers as hype is dying down
and public opinion is waning. Generative AI m ay have m ore niche uses in certain STEM fields, but at the end of the day it's far cheaper,
yields a better product, and is better for the econom y to just hire m ore Am erican artists.
