General Comment
Dear Ms. Parker,
We've been here before.
When Microsoft introduced ClipArt, you could type in a few words, and get an im age. You could do this several tim es, and get several
im ages to com bine. You didn't have to know how to draw to do it; it "dem ocratized" art, billboards, slides.
...but we paid for that.
Every artist whose work went into the ClipArt gallery got paid...yearly. Part of the high price of Microsoft Office had the sole purpose of
covering that! When som e artists no longer liked the deal, they asked to be rem oved from  the gallery, and Microsoft com plied. This
system  worked for about two decades!
Why can't generative im age AI com panies use som ething sim ilar? IF they need this raw m aterial, why can't they pay for it? Do they need
to be tariffed to be m ade to sim ply follow the laws that Microsoft was able to follow 30 years ago? Are we really going to be outdone by
Bill F'ing Clinton?
Let's m ake Am erica great again by partying like it's 1999!
