General Comment
“AI” is a blight on our society, providing no use in any conceivable m easure while contributing m assively to waste, environm ental im pact,
and theft of intellectual property (IP). IP, in particular, has been aggressively protected by the courts in favor of the com panies and
persons in possession of the copyrights that protect this IP. No exceptions have ever been given and peoples very lives have been
com pletely ruined by the lengths to which copyright violations have been prosecuted. Exceptions should not be given to som e com pany
with som e sort of “prom ise” to contribute to society when they have not proven within any stretch of im agination or reality that their Large
Language Models and other “AI” products can produce anything that resem bles a factual statem ent, uniquely creative output, or hum an-
like thought. These “AI” com panies are a sham , a grift, a snake oil con. Give no quarter. No exception.
