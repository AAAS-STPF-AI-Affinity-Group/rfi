General Comment
I am  disgusted at the pure incom petence that the US goverm ent is showing at this m om ent. Openai and such com panies should be
withheld to the laws of art. AI is m eant to help with things we don't want to do, not replace the things we WANT to do, such as art and
m usic. Thanks to AI, art is turning the com m unity of art into a wasteland of uncreativity and souless, m achinem ade art. Nothing that could
be created with a person holding a pen and paper. This is digusting, and effectively destroying art as we know it online.
