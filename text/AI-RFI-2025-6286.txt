General Comment
I oppose this proposal. I do not believe AI has a future in the US. It steals from  legitim ate, skilled Am ericans to "im prove" itself while they
see no returns. Generative AI is ineffective and overhyped, only useful as a buzzword or to steal for profit. I believe AI m ust continue to
have restrictions placed on it to prevent unethical uses that throw hardworking Am ericans under the bus.
