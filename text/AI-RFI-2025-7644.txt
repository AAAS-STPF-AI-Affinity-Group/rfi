General Comment
This proposal is farcical at best. The notion that Google, OpenAI, and other such entities should be allowed to help them selves to
everyone else's intellectual property and copyrighted m aterial without com pensation is playing with the aspects of Com m unism  everyone
agrees are terrible, it would essentially bring the m ost frustrating aspects of China into the US.
There is no universe where OpenAI com es anywhere close to being a m atter of "national security." This is not the space race, it's not a
nuclear power, there is nothing lost or gained in that regard by another m odule being able to write a sentence slightly cleaner.
In our current tim e, these program s are prim arily used in extraordinarily bad faith by people stealing artwork and literature for m onetary
gain, it is used by students to attem pt to cheat their way through school (to disastrous effect so far), and it is used by fraudsters who use it
to try and generate frivolous illegal lawsuits.
If Google wants to im prove their system s, they need to com m it to doing it through their own work and deals, not by disregarding
copyright laws and stealing the work of others. These laws were put in place for a reason, and they need to be upheld. AI's guardrails not
only need to rem ain in place, they need to be strengthened to protect the future of our country's legal system , the education system , and
our creative wings.
I im plore anyone who reads this, strike this proposal down for the sake of the USA's future.
