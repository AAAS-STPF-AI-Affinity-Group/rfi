General Comment
The "AI" that's being pushed on us is barely artificial intelligence at all. It's all Large Language Models that just chew up whatever
inform ation is fed to them  and spit it back out as plagiarized work, inaccurate statem ents, or false im agery that can be used to easily
spread disinform ation or libel. Anything it can do that is deem ed "necessary" can already be done by existing technology. This false AI
also wastes large am ounts of resources. It is not the way of the future. It is m erely a scam  being pushed on us by snake oil salesm en
m asked as technology enthusiasts. Despots are also waiting to use this technology to control inform ation and elevate their own
sociopolitical power. We should be shutting this down everywhere.
