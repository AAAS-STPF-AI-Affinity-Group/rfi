Executive Summary 
This authorship group was organized by and represents the AI Safety Initiative3, a 
community of technical and policy researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia 
Tech Research Institute interested in mitigating risks to American and human interests from 
advanced artificial intelligence. 
Frontier AI models represent a critical national security asset requiring immediate 
action to ensure America's economic competitiveness and geopolitical dominance. The 
recommended dual approach involves classifying frontier models as vital security assets while 
fostering commercial applications that drive innovation and economic growth. Success requires 
substantial investment in infrastructure, intelligence networks, and public-private partnerships, 
alongside comprehensive education and workforce development initiatives. In our response, we 
split AI models into two main classes - (1) frontier AI models and (2) their commercial 
applications - and provide four classes of recommendations: (1)National Security, Defense, and Research Dominance: Secure frontier AI development

Introduction 
AI dominance should be a vital national security priority. Through this lens, we 
provide concrete US government policy recommendations and examine the implications of these 
policies. Our recommendations encompass defense applications, infrastructure development, 
innovation strategy, education policy, and research funding for sustaining American leadership 
and strengthening the US economy in the years to come. 
Our discussions are broadly split into two focus areas: (1) frontier AI, or highly capable 
foundation models with never-before-seen capabilities, such as GPT 4o; and (2) commercial 
applications  of these frontier models which interface with consumers, businesses, or government 
partners directly, such as ChatGPT. The US government should rapidly promote an open, 
economically competitive environment for commercial applications, while treating the most 
sensitive components of frontier AI as critical national security assets.

The price of ineffective action is high: Extremely transformative AI is likely to come 
during this presidential term, and, unless managed responsibly, will result in acute negative 
consequences for American interests globally across almost every sector. We acknowledge the 
risks involved and provide recommendations to mitigate them in four (4) sections: 
(1) National Security, Defense, and Research Dominance: Why are frontier models so vital to
national security, and what can be done to protect American dominance? 
(2) Technical Infrastructure and Model Development: What resources and infrastructure does
frontier AI dominance require, and how can the United States rapidly protect these resources? 
(3) Innovation and Education: What educational and economic systems are necessary to
ensure commercial AI application dominance, and how can these be innovatively promoted? 
(4) Balancing Autonomy and Safety: What are the risks of integrating commercial AI
applications in businesses and governments, and how can these risks be managed responsibly? 
(1) National Security, Defense, and Research Dominance
Why frontier AI is a national security asset: Advanced AI systems can perform highly 
complex tasks, such as analyzing vast datasets, automating decision-making, and even simulating 
scenarios for defense and intelligence purposes, with efficiency and quality rivaling human 
experts, and will continue to gain in intelligence, likely exceeding human experts sometime this 
decade4. Nations that develop and control these human-exceeding frontier models will gain an 
insurmountable edge in everything from cybersecurity and military strategy to economic 
forecasting. For these reasons, frontier AI models should be treated with the same level of 
classification as advanced nuclear research and intelligence-gathering systems. 
Implications of underinvestment: Inaction and underinvestment in AI will have 
devastating economic, military, and geopolitical consequences as America risks losing its global 
AI dominance. If geopolitical counterparts such as China and the EU begin to outpace US 4 Grace, K., Stewart, H., Sandk√ºhler, J. F., Thomas, S., Weinstein-Raun, B., & Brauner, J. (2024, January 5).

investment and innovation in AI-driven national defense, the US military will be technologically 
outmatched and unable to withstand catastrophic security threats by adversaries. With other 
nations controlling the most advanced AI systems and critical electronic components, the US 
would find itself increasingly dependent on adversaries such as China, heightening its 
vulnerability to cyber warfare and strategic coercion5.  
Emerging threats to frontier AI models: American frontier AI models face constant 
threats from nation-state adversaries, particularly China, who aim to steal model weights, corrupt 
training pipelines, or embed malicious code at the supply-chain level. These sophisticated threats 
extend beyond traditional cyberattacks, employing covert surveillance of research facilities, 
exploitation of open-source libraries, and injection attacks designed to manipulate system 
outputs. As frontier AI capabilities increase, these models become even more valuable 
targets, attracting increasingly advanced and persistent threats. If not proactively addressed, 
foreign adversaries will erode stakeholder trust in our systems and technological dominance. 
Mitigating threats: To safeguard America's frontier AI capabilities against sophisticated 
threats, the federal government must implement a coordinated, multi-layered defense strategy 
spanning the entire AI lifecycle. Since cutting-edge models predominantly reside with private 
corporations, we recommend establishing formalized partnerships between leading AI 
laboratories and key government agencies, with frontier model research and data classified at 
the SECRET/TS level. This classification necessitates streamlined security clearance processes 
for qualified researchers while maintaining rigorous standards. 
Within this classified framework, we propose a division of agency responsibilities: 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) should lead the implementation of 
Zero Trust architecture across national AI research facilities, ensuring continuous verification of 
all access requests with advanced cyber-physical protection measures implemented at data 
centers housing frontier AI systems. Concurrently, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 5 Special Competitive Studies Project. (2022). Mid-Decade Challenges to National Competitiveness.

(DARPA) and Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) should allocate 
funding for comprehensive adversarial testing and vulnerability assessments, utilizing 
established frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS6 and OWASP7 to systematically identify and 
remediate security vulnerabilities. 
For enhanced threat detection capabilities, CISA should develop and deploy advanced 
anomaly-monitoring systems throughout federal and contractor-operated facilities, creating an 
early warning network for potential intrusions. By integrating these security measures under 
federal coordination and aligning them with existing intelligence capabilities, the United States 
can establish a dynamic, adaptive defense posture that evolves alongside emerging AI risks, 
thereby preserving America's technological advantage in this critical domain. 
Securing human capital: US dominance in artificial intelligence depends on advanced 
technologies and the skilled professionals behind that innovation. Yet, a major concern is the 
potential loss of talent when researchers and engineers are drawn to foreign competitors or rival 
companies8. To counter this risk, the federal government should work with public 
universities and University-Affiliated Research Centers to develop strong AI workforce 
retention programs. These programs should include competitive grants, fellowships, and clearly 
defined career paths designed to attract and keep top experts. In addition, the State Department 
should simplify visa and immigration processes to help recruit leading AI professionals from 
allied nations. At the same time, Intelligence Community (IC), such as the National Security 
Agency (NSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), must enhance personnel evaluations 
and insider-threat detection to prevent any adversarial impact. By consistently investing in skill 8 Marks, D., & Frenkel, O. (2025, February 11). America‚Äôs Technology Lead Depends on High-Skilled Workers.

development, professional growth, and international partnerships, the federal government can 
build an attractive pipeline of AI talent. This strategy not only reduces the risk of intellectual 
capital draining to non-ally entities but also supports a secure and innovative ecosystem that 
benefits US agencies, private enterprises, and the overall national interest. 
Explainability, not AGI: For the most strategic pathway forward in AI development, the 
US should steer clear of initiating a single, massive project focused on AGI development and 
pursue a more holistic framework. An aggressive, monolithic push towards developing 
superintelligent AI could destabilize global relations and provoke similar initiatives by our 
adversaries, particularly nations like China. Instead, fostering innovation through public-private 
partnerships can promote responsible AI advancement without escalating geopolitical risks. 
Additionally, the inner workings of all frontier models are currently opaque, reducing their 
reliability in defense and intelligence applications. Enhancing Explainable AI (xAI) is crucial for 
building trust and facilitating informed decision-making, as it focuses on developing models that 
provide clear, understandable explanations for their outputs. We encourage research 
investment from DoD/IC stakeholders, specifically into mechanistic and non-mechanistic 
interpretability of frontier AI models. 
Intellectual property and procurement controls: To protect intellectual property and 
optimize procurement in AI, the government should adopt strategic measures that target both 
security and efficiency. This includes tightening counterintelligence and law enforcement in 
coordination with LEOs to combat state-sponsored theft of AI technologies, prosecuting 
espionage attempts, imposing trade sanctions on recipients of stolen IP, and enhancing 
cybersecurity for defense contractors and AI firms9. Additionally, classified research programs 
will help safeguard critical innovations by ensuring sensitive projects are conducted in 
secure facilities with strict access controls. On the procurement front, streamlining acquisition 
processes by employing agile, tech-friendly approaches, such as using fast-track acquisition 9Godefroy, J. (2024, March 7). How Does Artificial Intelligence Affect Intellectual Property Protection? Rouse.com.

models and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements, can reduce development timelines 
and facilitate rapid integration of AI solutions. Enhanced unclassified public‚Äìprivate channels for 
less sensitive national security applications, including the establishment of AI test beds, 
innovation hubs, and exchange programs between industry and federal agencies, will further 
ensure that cutting-edge AI technology is effectively deployed to meet agency needs. 
Opportunities for stronger export controls: Global governance of AI demands a 
balanced approach that promotes allied innovation while strictly controlling the export of 
sensitive technologies; US investments in chips manufacturing represent a unique opportunity to 
effectively enforce export regulation through technical controls. We encourage work from the 
Bureau of Industry and Security to study and test geo-tagging American exports to Tier 1/2 
Countries, and recommend that National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) codify 
geo-tagging standards, which will make it efficient to identify any attempts of refurbishment or 
smuggling. These protections may be complemented with end-use agreements to bestow legal 
onus for smuggling on responsible parties. 
(2) Technical Infrastructure and Model Development
The need for evaluations: As emerging race dynamics between AI labs have shown, 
frontier AI advancements are extremely rapid, even outpacing the capacity of traditional means 
to share research effectively. We expect this to continue most acutely around evaluations of top 
AI models. For this reason, the Administration must immediately develop resilient model 
evaluation tools and benchmarks in key fields of national security, including CBRN threats, 
intelligence-gathering, cybersecurity, and strategic planning. These efforts must be shared and 
developed across DoD/IC agencies, allowing for accurate assessment of US model capabilities 
and data-backed model alignment with US interests.  Hardware as a key resource: The recently enacted CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 
initially served to incentivize domestic chip manufacturing by providing $53 billion to US 
manufacturing facilities; however, due to bureaucratic delays, the federal government was slow 
7 


 
to allocate grants. Many companies did not receive the funding that they were promised; 
therefore, in order to promote timely critical hardware manufacturing and development, 
legislators should aim to expedite bureaucratic grant-delivering processes. By facilitating 
efficient public-private collaboration, the US will accelerate its path toward increased domestic 
hardware protection and become less reliant on other countries, thereby strengthening national 
security.  Establishing data centers in allied countries is essential to address domestic 
constraints on compute resources. We recommend the US establish partnerships to maintain 
data centers in allied states while ensuring the security and integrity of these facilities.   In order to ensure long-term sustainability and efficiency, the US must secure its supply 
chain of critical minerals for AI development. Currently, the US relies heavily upon China for 
minerals that are crucial for semiconductor production, such as germanium, gallium, palladium, 
and polysilicon10. This allows China to exert control over the American AI sector through 
restricting exports, as was done in December 202411. Any disruptions to the AI supply chain 
could compromise national security. Therefore, the US should bolster strategic international 
relationships with countries such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, Namibia, and various South 
American nations‚Äìall of whom have access to rare earth elements and other equally important 
minerals. Additionally, policymakers should develop bilateral trade agreements for other 
countries to export their mineral resources to the US. In doing so, the US can enhance 
production efficiency by minimizing supply chain vulnerabilities, ultimately fortifying national 
security.   Efficiency increases: Emerging technologies and operational practices are offering 
promising pathways to mitigate the energy intensity of AI infrastructure. AI-driven optimization 
systems are themselves becoming critical tools for improving data center efficiency, as they can

monitor, analyze, and optimize energy usage in real time, precisely identifying inefficiencies and 
reducing wasted power12 13. At the hardware level, fundamental innovations in chip architecture 
are yielding significant efficiency gains. In order to incentivize the production, distribution, and 
usage of these emerging technologies, the NSF should allocate additional funds toward 
research institutions as well as prominent software/hardware companies for the study of 
energy-efficient computation. 
(3) Innovation and Education It is not enough for the United States to host and protect frontier models - the 
Administration should actively support an open environment for their commercial applications. 
Support industry research on best practices and adoption methods: As AI is able to 
automate more jobs, productivity advantages will accrue disproportionately to AI-proficient 
individuals and organizations, underscoring the importance of effective AI adoption strategies 
for American companies to stay competitive14. Key research to be federally funded through the 
Small Business Administration should include: (1) comprehensive impact assessments across 
sectors, (2) evidence-based AI utilization frameworks, (3) research on effective teaching methods 
for building both practical skills and conceptual understanding of AI (including its limitations, 
risks, and benefits), (4) developmental frameworks examining AI's effects on youth cognitive 
and social development, and (5) frameworks for Human-AI partnerships that amplify human 
strengths and creativity rather than attempting to substitute for human capabilities. 
Workforce AI training and development: A workforce prepared for AI integration 
demands both technical proficiency and enhanced human-centric skills. In government, AI 
training needs to be a standard requirement for both new and existing employees to ensure a

workforce proficient in AI tools. In the public sector, the Department of Labor, in partnership 
with research institutions, should conduct thorough studies on occupations at risk of AI 
disruption. This research should guide the development of targeted training programs that build 
on existing worker expertise while also enhancing digital skills through online, industry-aligned 
micro-credentials and college courses. Additionally, the Department of Commerce should 
establish a national skills database to track evolving job requirements across sectors, enabling 
educational institutions and individuals to adapt rapidly to market demands.  
Private sector applications: AI adoption in highly controlled industries like healthcare, 
finance, and energy should be guided by clear standards set by specific regulatory bodies, such as 
the FDA for healthcare, the SEC for finance, and the FERC for energy. The use of regulatory 
sandboxes, as seen in the UK's Financial Conduct Authority15 model, would allow these sectors 
to safely test AI systems under supervision, ensuring their effectiveness without compromising 
safety or integrity. Key applications‚Äîsuch as AI for diagnostic analysis in healthcare, financial 
reporting in finance, and predictive maintenance in energy grids‚Äîshould be selectively 
scrutinized by these agencies to maintain industry standards while promoting innovation. 
To further encourage AI innovation, the Small Business Administration (SBA) 
should provide targeted subsidies and clear guidelines for cloud computing and AI usage to 
small and medium-sized enterprises. These incentives could include grants, tax breaks, and 
educational resources on integrating AI into business operations, helping smaller firms more 
quickly adapt to technological advancements. This would help bridge the gap between large and 
small businesses, fostering innovation across a wider range of industries while ensuring that 
ethical AI practices are upheld. 
Bureaucratic adoption of AI: To maximize AI‚Äôs impact in government, agencies must 
take strategic steps to enhance efficiency, decision-making, and citizen engagement. Government 
agencies should expand AI-powered public interfaces‚Äîincluding chatbots and virtual 15 Financial Conduct Authority. (2024). AI Update. https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/ai-update.pdf 
10 


assistants‚Äîto improve citizen engagement and simplify access to public services. AI-driven 
decision-making tools - building on GSAi16 - should be embedded in government operations to 
enable real-time data analysis, refine policy outcomes, and enhance democratic governance. We 
recommend the OPM prioritize AI-driven automation of routine administrative tasks to 
reduce inefficiencies and free up public servants for higher-value work throughout the 
federal government. Automating data entry, scheduling, and document processing will improve 
operational efficiency and service delivery to the American people. 
Build AI capabilities among youth: AI literacy should be integrated across K-12 
curricula, merging technical skills, responsible use, and critical evaluation of AI systems. 
Building on the foundation set by the 18 states that mandate media literacy classes, efforts should 
expand to include AI competencies.17 We recommend establishing an AI Education 
Coordination Office within OSTP. This board should consist of educators, AI researchers, 
ethicists, and industry representatives responsible for developing comprehensive AI literacy 
standards. Given AI‚Äôs rapid evolution, the advisory board should conduct quarterly curriculum 
relevance reviews, feeding into a structured curriculum update every 18 months‚Äîsignificantly 
faster than traditional cycles. Additionally, OSTP should oversee a specialized rapid response 
team responsible for promptly creating supplemental educational materials addressing major AI 
breakthroughs. These materials may be made available through a digital repository, continuously  accessible to schools and students nationwide, and tailored to different audience ages. 
Assessment methods should transition to portfolio-based evaluations, enabling students to 
demonstrate AI competencies practically, highlighting technical, nuanced understanding, and 
reasoning skills on AI.

(4) Balancing Autonomy and Safety
Data Handling and Protection: Government agencies must enforce strict policies on 
data usage and cross-border data sharing that clearly define permissible data flows, limit 
inference risks, and comply with privacy regulations, while emergency data-erasure protocols 
can be used to swiftly remove compromised information in the event of a breach18 19. By aligning 
these measures with international standards and rigorous screening processes, the federal 
government can safeguard data integrity and privacy while enabling secure AI operations 
throughout their lifecycle. 
Risk assessments & regulatory Frameworks: Establishing effective risk assessments 
and regulatory frameworks is essential to ensuring that AI technologies are developed and 
deployed responsibly without stifling innovation. Existing regulatory bodies, such as the Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC), have already taken steps to address AI-related risks, but regulations 
should be streamlined further to avoid overburdening developers, especially smaller companies 
and startups, which may struggle with compliance costs.20 We recommend that NIST take a 
leading role in creating and overseeing commercial AI regulations, acting as the primary 
body for monitoring AI development and working with the FTC to ensure that companies 
are held accountable for their commercial AI applications. Additionally, the OECD‚Äôs 
Principles on Artificial Intelligence21, which were established under the previous Trump 
administration, provide valuable guidance for crafting regulations that promote innovation while 
protecting public safety and ensuring fairness. Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA)22 is one 
widely accepted methodology that leverages data modeling to evaluate the likelihood of risks

occurring and their potential impact. In the context of AI, PRA could address issues like 
algorithmic bias, security vulnerabilities, and ethical concerns early in the development process. 
To further enhance the responsible development of AI, we recommend prioritizing the 
integration of PRA into FTC AI policy frameworks.  
In addition to structured risk assessments, market-driven solutions like AI incident 
reporting systems are effective tools for identifying and addressing emerging threats. Voluntary 
initiatives like the AI Incident Database (AIID)23 serve as independent fact-checking resources 
that document real-world AI failures, fostering transparency and promoting industry-wide 
learning. To strengthen the reliability of these systems, we recommend efforts to improve their 
data quality and standardization, recognizing that while there are challenges24 encouraging the 
development of similar initiatives can still play a valuable role in promoting accountability 
without the need for heavy-handed regulations. By supporting the FTC‚Äôs leadership and building 
on these frameworks, the US can foster a balanced regulatory environment that encourages 
growth while safeguarding societal interests. 
Conclusion Frontier AI models represent a critical national security asset requiring immediate 
action‚Äîthey will determine America's economic competitiveness and geopolitical stability in the 
coming years. We advocate a dual approach: classifying and securing frontier models as vital 
national security assets while simultaneously fostering commercial applications that drive 
innovation and economic growth. This strategy demands substantial investment in physical 
infrastructure, robust intelligence-sharing networks, and public-private partnerships with frontier 
AI labs.  The Administration must mobilize the full DoD/IC apparatus to mitigate security risks 
while integrating AI capabilities across defense applications, bureaucratic systems, and industry

sectors. The US cannot neglect its citizens in its journey to AI dominance - we must establish 
educational programs for youth, hone the technical workforce, and protect existing human 
capital.  The technological revolution before us offers unprecedented opportunity, but only if 
America acts decisively now‚Äîbecause in the race for AI dominance, there are no silver medals.
