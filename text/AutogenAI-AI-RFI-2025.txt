 AI Tax Incentives to Strengthen Economic Growth 
 1. Restore Immediate Expensing of R&D Costs to Strengthen AI
 Leadership
 Restoring immediate expense of R&D costs under IRS §174 is essential for maintaining 
 U.S. dominance in AI innovation, national security, and global economic competition. AI  companies require high upfront capital investment in talent, computing power , and  
 research. By eliminating amortization requirements and allowing full expensing of R&D  costs, the U.S. can: 
 ●  Increase cash flow for AI firms, enabling them to scale operations faster, reinvest
 in cutting-edge AI models, and accelerate innovation.
 ●  Incentivize AI firms to hire and retain U.S.-based technical talent, reducing the
 need to of fshore jobs to countries with more favorable tax policies.
 ●  Encourage private-sector and government AI partnerships, fostering AI solutions
 for national security, cybersecurity, healthcare, and federal contracting.
 ●  Position the U.S. as the global hub for AI investment, ensuring that AI research,
 intellectual property, and economic benefits remain within trusted allies.
 2. Expand AI-Specific R&D Tax Credits for Companies at All Stages of
 Growth
 While existing R&D tax credits help offset development costs, they often favor large 
 corporations with significant tax liabilities. To foster a thriving AI ecosystem, the U.S.  should introduce AI-specific R&D tax credits that: 
 ●  Apply to companies at any stage of growth—including startups, mid-sized firms,
 and established enterprises—to ensure that tax incentives benefit the entire AI sector.
 3 


 ●  Provide additional tax benefits for companies developing AI for national security
 applications, incentivizing investment in AI solutions for defense, cybersecurity,
 and public-sector efficiency.
 ●  Increase tax credits for AI-related compute infrastructure investments, ensuring
 that AI firms can access the necessary chips, cloud resources, and supercomputing power without being hindered by high costs.
 ●  Create a "First-to-Market" AI Tax Credit, rewarding U.S.-based AI companies that
 develop breakthrough AI models and bring them to market before international competitors.
 3. Incentivize AI Companies from 5 Eyes International Community to
 Operate in the U.S.
 Attracting foreign AI firms from trusted allied nations, such as those in the 5 Eyes 
 intelligence alliance (U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), would increase AI  investment, create high-paying jobs, and strengthen technological collaboration. To  make the U.S. the most attractive destination for AI businesses worldwide, policymakers  should: 
 ●  Offer foreign AI firms a "U.S. AI Business Investment Credit", providing up to
 20% tax relief for AI companies that establish headquarters, research facilities, or regional offices in the U.S.
 ●  Provide a fast-track tax incentive program for foreign AI companies that relocate
 their AI development teams to the U.S., ensuring that AI jobs and IP remain within trusted economic alliances.
 ●  Reduce corporate tax rates for AI businesses that reinvest profits in U.S.-based
 AI development, reinforcing long-term innovation and economic growth.

 4. Establish AI Tax Incentives for Secure AI Development and Compliance
 As AI becomes more integral to national security and critical industries, tax incentives  should reward companies that meet rigorous security and compliance standards. This  could include: 
 4 


 ●  Tax credits for AI companies that implement advanced cybersecurity measures to 
 protect AI models, datasets, and government applications from adversarial 
 threats. 
 ●  R&D expensing for companies that adhere to AI safety and ethics guidelines, 
 ensuring responsible AI deployment in healthcare, defense, and finance. 
 ●  Tax deductions for AI startups that invest in compliance with U.S. data security 
 regulations, ensuring AI innovation aligns with national security priorities. 
 ●  To accelerate AI-driven innovation and economic growth, the U.S. should 
 eliminate taxes on venture capital (VC) funding for early-stage AI companies  generating less than $2 million in annual revenue. AI startups face significant  capital-intensive requirements, including high computing costs, R&D  investments, and regulatory compliance burdens, making early funding critical for  survival and scaling. Taxing venture capital raised—before profitability—is a  major disincentive to investment and restricts the ability of U.S. AI startups to  compete with better-funded foreign competitors. 
 ●  To support  job creation and economic growth  , the U.S. should implement a 
 targeted tax credit program for AI companies whose work leads to significant  employment expansion. While AI is often associated with automation, AI-driven  businesses create high-value jobs across multiple industries, including software  engineering, data science, cybersecurity, defense, healthcare, and financial  services. A tax incentive tied to employment growth will encourage AI firms to  expand their workforce, invest in talent development, and drive long-term  economic prosperity. 
 5. Incentivize AI Companies to Commercialize University Research and 
 Fund Academic AI Innovation 
 Universities serve as foundational research hubs for AI breakthroughs, but technology 
 transfer from academia to industry is often slow and underfunded. To accelerate AI  commercialization, the U.S. should introduce tax benefits for AI companies that  collaborate with universities and make their technology available to the government  through SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) and STTR (Small Business  Technology Transfer) programs. 
 Proposed incentives include: 
 ●  A "University AI Commercialization Credit" that provides tax benefits for 
 companies licensing AI research from U.S. universities and turning it into 
 commercial products or government applications. 
 5 


 ●  Increased R&D tax deductions for companies funding university-led AI research,
 particularly in fields like AI ethics, autonomous systems, and AI for national
 security.
 ●  A "Government AI Transfer Incentive", offering tax reductions for businesses that
 integrate university-developed AI technology into federal programs, defense applications, and public-sector AI projects.
 ●  Preferential tax treatment for AI firms engaging in SBIR/STTR contracts,
 ensuring that small businesses working with government-backed research receive enhanced tax credits and expedited funding opportunities.
 By aligning industry, academia, and government AI initiatives, the U.S. can accelerate  AI innovation, strengthen national security applications, and maintain global AI  leadership.

 By fast-tracking AI adoption from 5 Eyes businesses, the U.S. can enhance national  security, accelerate AI integration in government applications, and ensure that economic  growth is shared among trusted allies. Aligning regulatory, procurement, and AI  certification standards across 5 Eyes nations would further remove barriers to  collaboration, allowing allied AI companies to develop mutually beneficial innovations in  defense, cybersecurity, and advanced computing. 
 AI for Rapid Adoption of Best Capabilities 
 Encourage AI in Proposal Writing and Contracting, Not Restrict It:  AI increases  efficiency, improves accuracy, and levels the playing field for small businesses bidding 
 on government contracts. The integration of AI into proposal writing streamlines the 
 process, enabling quicker submissions and ensuring proposals are consistent and  accurate. This technological advancement is particularly beneficial for small businesses,  which often lack the resources of larger companies. By automating repetitive tasks and  intelligently analyzing data, AI tools help small enterprises produce high-quality  proposals that can compete effectively against bigger players. 
 Banning or restricting AI in proposals would disproportionately benefit large incumbents, 
 while stifling innovation. Large companies typically have more extensive resources and  can manage without AI, whereas smaller businesses rely on AI to mitigate resource  disparities. Restricting AI use in proposal writing would hinder the ability of small  businesses to compete on an equal footing, potentially locking out innovative solutions  and fresh perspectives that these smaller 
 7 


 entities bring to the table. 
 Recommendation  : The U.S. should explicitly support AI-enhanced proposal writing, 
 with guidelines to ensure compliance and fairness. By setting clear guidelines, the 
 government can ensure that AI is used ethically and effectively, maintaining a level  playing field and fostering an environment of fair competition. Such support would not  only aid in the efficient handling of proposals but also in adhering to regulatory 
 requirements and specific challenges of different sectors, thus enhancing the overall  quality and relevance of government contract proposals.
