General Comment
Stealing is stealing whether it's done by a hum an being or by a com puter. In fact when it's AI it's worse because it's regurgitating hum an-
m ade m aterial into the sort of AI slop we unfortunately all have experience dealing with now. The wealth of a few individuals isn't worth it.
