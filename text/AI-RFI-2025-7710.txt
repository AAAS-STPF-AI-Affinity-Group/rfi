General Comment
AI is not a technology worthy of supporting at the expense of long-standing U.S. copyright protections and laws. 
It is difficult enough for artists in any m edium  to retain rights to their work in the digital age. To elim inate or weaken even one of the
inadequate protections for artists and writers is bad enough and unjustifiable on its face. To seek to facilitate the extraction of creative
work from  its originator to enable another entity to profit from  it is an even m ore illegitim ate and destructive act. Itâ€™s m erely high-tech theft
and grift, antithetical to creativity. 
I oppose any effort to facilitate the reach of AI-enhanced technology as exem plified by OpenAI to exploit the work of others for private
gain.
