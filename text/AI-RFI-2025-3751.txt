General Comment
AI generated content is not som ething that should be protected at all, m uch less endorsed and enabled by the governm ent. It is built on
theft and an utter disregard for any kind of ethics. Private com m ercial AI projects have all yet to show that they are even capable of
turning a profit, even with the fact that the content they feed into their AI m odels is all stolen and unpaid for. The governm ent should not
subsidize, protect, or encourage private sector AI developm ent in its current iteration.
