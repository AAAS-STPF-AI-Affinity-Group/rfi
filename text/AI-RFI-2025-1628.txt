General Comment
Big tech seeks to steal and plagiarize decades of copyrighted m aterial world wide all to increase their bottom  line. This AI action plan is
their last resort, to destroy copyright law so that they m ight have unfettered access to copyrighted m aterial without consideration to those
who create it. 
There is no need for AI to be a priority in this country, and m uch less a need to m ake it easier for these com panies to steal rightfully
owned and created works of Am ericans.
