General Comment
I am  deeply concerned about the future widespread unchecked usage of generative AI going forward. I am  an audio engineer and
m usician and I have already seen work in m y field decrease at a staggering rate due to its usage. The end results are of extrem ely poor
quality and will threaten the livelihoods of any Am erican working artists. I recognize the value that Large Language Models hold in
research fields, but I think allowing them  to run ram pant in the creative and business sector will cause untold dam age to countless
Am ericans and will severely harm  Am erican culture as well. I urge those in power to strongly consider restricting the usage of these
generative platform s outside of research uses. I believe they will be a disaster both culturally and financially, both for artists and
com panies.
