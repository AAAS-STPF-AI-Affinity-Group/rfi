General Comment
The entire prem ise if AI, specifically gen AI, in regards to im ages, m usic, and writing is based on the creation of works previously. After
which the people who worked so hard to hone their skills and dedicate day in and day out to becom e m asters of their craft - have their
works stolen.
We are not com pensated in any way for the work that is stolen from  us. We are not credited. And the only people that benefit are the
com panies that m ake AI. 
Im agine som eone stealing food from  farm ers, breaking in, destroying a store for kitchen supplies. Then Kidnaps a chef. Putting to use all
the stolen goods and the chef who will not get paid. The only person getting paid is the thief. 
That is what AI is done. We CANNOT, give AI anym ore leeway. They cannot continue to steal from  the hard work of the Am erican
people. And the adm inistration cannot give this to them . Please do not push this executive order.
