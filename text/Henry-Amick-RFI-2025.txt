Henry Amick  
My name is Henry, and I am a graduating  senior from a Western Pennsylvania High School. 
Recently, I completed a project researching the impacts of AI on Math Education in 2025, and 
the current administration's push for limited regulations on AI is extremely relevant to this field. 
My research h as led me to believe that AI is an overall detriment to the American education 
system and that it should be kept out of schools. Heavy generative AI usage leads to a reduction 
in problem -solving ability and critical thinking skills in our youth. Young peop le becoming 
dependent on the assistance of AI is only amplifying a culture that discourages sustained 
attention, complex processing, and deeper engagement with the popularity of today's media 
forums. Whilst mass restrictions on AI may be seen as an infring ement of rights, the reduction of 
AI accessibility in schools is paramount to supporting future generations of American citizens.
