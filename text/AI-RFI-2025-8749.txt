General Comment
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public
AI is theft. Using others works. AI should have no im m unity from  copyright when it takes what others did. Machines having m ore rights
than hum ans at this point
