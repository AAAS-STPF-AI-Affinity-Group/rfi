General Comment
This will harm  Am ericans. AI is a worthless fad and it is not the Am erican people's responsibility to tolerate the erosion of our rights just
because tech com panies want to force us to integrate their underperform ing toys into everything. Tech com panies need to be held to the
sam e standard as everyone else. This stuff creates soulless slop that gives everything a skeezy and cheap reputation. Tools like this only
ever get used to replace living, hard-working, REAL PEOPLE with real talent and drive. There is zero value in sustaining a "dom inance" in
a field that the m ajority of people already find distasteful, disreputable, and harm ful. Can we please live in a world where we don't
sacrifice the average Am erican's rights just because m assive corporations are worried that their golden product isn't m aking them  any
m oney because it takes so m any resources to create a m achine that perform s on par with your average 7th grader with access to an actual
search engine like DuckDuckGo
