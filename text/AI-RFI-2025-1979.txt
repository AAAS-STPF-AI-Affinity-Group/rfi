General Comment
I do not believe AI will serve as a benefit to the future of Am erica. If anything, the only thing AI has done, as far as I can see, is norm alize
m ediocrity. If the Trum p adm inistration wants to retain any shred of dignity it has left, it would rebuke the use of AI in any capacity in its
functioning.
