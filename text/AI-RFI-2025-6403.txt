General Comment
No one wants this, except the tech-bro oligarchy that spent far too m uch m oney developing AI & fleeced the governm ent to invest in it.
AI is not som ething end users want forced upon them . Sim ply review the num bers of end users who have opted out of Apple Intelligence,
Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. 
AI dam ages artists ability to create without worry of non-rem uneration or works being stolen. AI already raises considerable privacy,
copyright, & online safety concerns that have yet to be resolved. AI creates an alm ost catastrophic environm ental cost. The developm ent
path of AI is accelerating at an exponential rate without any sort of curbs placed to guide it & will result in uncontrolled & uncontrollable
system s that could result in econom ic disaster (job losses, m arket volatility, etc.), privacy violations, bias prom otion & autom ation of
weapons system s.
