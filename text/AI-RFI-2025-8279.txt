General Comment
AI, or the technology that currently m ost prom inently carries that nam e, is nothing m ore than a m achine that launders intellectual property.
It consum es copyrighted m aterial and excretes derivative work stripped of the rights of the original creators. Consum ers do not want this.
It only exists independent of any m onetization, because no one wants it. Linear progress in im provem ents require exponentially increasing
training data. This is not viable technologically or econom ically. No special perm issions should be granted to any com pany for the
purposes of developing AI. People do not want this
