General Comment
This is an obscene abuse of power that doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's specifically intended to protect Elon Musk and other tech
investors from  facing consequences from  crim es the com panies they've supported have already com m itted. As well as prop up a failing
technology before those sam e people lose all the m oney they've invested. It's another sim ple and disgusting exam ple of corporate welfare
and legal exceptions for the wealthy hiding behind a xenophobic boogeym an of another country developing the sam e worthless
technology.
