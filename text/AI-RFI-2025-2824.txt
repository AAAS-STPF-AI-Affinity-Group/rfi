General Comment
This request, if passed, would be highly dangerous and im m ediately harm ful to Am erican innovation and creativity. The "burdensom e
governm ent requirem ents restricting private sector AI developm ent and deploym ent" are in place to ensure that there there is due process
when involving m atters of copyright law. This request would usurp Am erican law in favor of giving AI-involved businesses and
corporations the legal freedom  to wanton theft from  already-struggling Am erican creatives, innovators, and artists.
I am  stating, with absolute conviction, that this request should be denied, for the greater good of our United States of Am erica.
