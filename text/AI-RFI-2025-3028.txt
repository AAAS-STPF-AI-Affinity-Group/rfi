General Comment
As a freelance illustrator who m akes his livelihood through the creation, distribution, & developm ent of digital art, the “AI Action Plan” is
not only poorly founded, it’s dangerous. I don’t want Sam  Altm an and his ilk running ram pant over copyright for the careless exploitation
of others’ creativity, as it’ll only lead to further exploitation of artists & a needless waste of energy that AI already attem pts.
Altm an is fleecing the Am erican public with a rose-tinted view of AI’s potential that doesn’t m easure up to what his com pany uses it for; it
profits off of theft and gives little back to people who could benefit from  it. Do NOT let him  sucker you in with his lies about copyright
being an “obstacle to freedom ”; it’s a guardrail m eant to keep rich types like him  from  exploiting the working class.
