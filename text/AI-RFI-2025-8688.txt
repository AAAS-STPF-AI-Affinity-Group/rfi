To whom it may concern, 
Regarding the National Science Foundationâ€™s Request for Information on the Development of an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
Do not create new copyright exemptions that allow tech entities to steal from authors and 
creators without proper permission and compensation.  
Allowing copyrighted work to be legally used for the gain of these tech companies hurts small 
businesses and Americans overall.  
Thank you, 
A Concerned USA Citizen
