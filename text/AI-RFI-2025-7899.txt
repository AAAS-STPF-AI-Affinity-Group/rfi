General Comment
The only AI Action Plan that should be developed is one which addresses the rights of original content creators and tradem ark holders as
well as the risk and im pact to Am erican jobs and em ploym ent.
It has been proven the current "AI" is little m ore than an advance LLM. "AI" in its current form  cannot create anything new from  scratch -
it can only m anipulate existing knowledge-m uch of which has been scrapped from  the web and used in unlawfully in the developm ent of a
for-profit product. Over-reliance on AI will lead to a weaker Am erica. We are already losing the technology race with China, and
Am erican education is pathetic com pared to other 1st world nations.
Increasing use and governm ent support of AI will lead to increased reliance, ultim ately leading to an econom ically weaker Am erica
incapable of generating new innovations, products, or technologies.
