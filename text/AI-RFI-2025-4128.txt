the livelihood of the com m on people.
If it is to be im plem ented in any form , it should be in such a way where it is im possible to dam age, negatively affect or otherwise be a
detrim ent to people's careers and/or jobs, whether directly or indirectly. People should not lose their work for whatever com es out of this.
