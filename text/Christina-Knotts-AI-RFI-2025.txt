Please do not contract AI to Elon Musk or any of his companies. It's very clear he wants all of our 
data and it is also clear that he does not have pure intentions for this. He also acts as though he is 
above the law, which means he operates without fear o f accountability. Please do not hire Elon 
Musk or any of his companies for this. Please do contract/hire multiple companies for these 
projects and require each have strong security and ethics programming. Please do not put all of our 
data into the hands of  one entity. Please only contract to companies that have been thoroughly 
vetted and are trusted for this... do not contract to Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, or any of those entities 
who wish to gut our systems and remake America. We don't need or want ideology b aked into AI.
