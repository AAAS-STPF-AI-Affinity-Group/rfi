Our world is driven by digital communications, and digital transformations over the past three 
years, has further complicated access to one's PII (personally identifiable information). AI, more 
specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have  transformed data 
management, especially in terms of privacy and security. It is critically important that periodic 
reviews of authorized users of PII, include reviewing who has the need -to-know. Authorized and 
Need-to-Know are two distinct aspects, as are  Security and Privacy. NIST Risk Framework (SP 
800-53 & 800 -161) must be a practice for all entities. Transparent privacy policies and consent 
mechanisms must be required and entities using AI tools (ML/DL), must implement mechanisms 
of to inform individua ls how their data is collected, used, and shared. There must be mechanisms 
in place to ensure individuals always retain control over their PII or personal data, and shield 
individuals from unauthorized access, misuse, or exploration. This also applies to a llow only 
those with the need -to-know have practices in place to ensure proper access and use. Policies and 
procedures must be implemented that address access control, managing who is authorized AND 
who has the need to access. Procedures and common practic es in granting appropriate 
permissions, using multi -factor authentication, and regularly reviewing and updating access 
rights. Entities must prioritize data protection by implementing robust security measures, and 
ensuring that individuals always retain ow nership of their data. Entities must implemented 
privacy-by-design principles, Entities must implemented measures to ensure data minimization 
and purpose limitations Entities must regularly audit and assess privacy compliance.
