General Comment
This is a com pletely unnecessary plan for the governm ent to partake in at this tim e. AI m ay not be a fully developed technology, but it's
not necessary to push for right now when m ore pressing m atters are to be addressed by the governm ent at large. Nam ely, ones they
caused them selves via aggressive attem pts at foreign policy, with publicly and notably poor results. It should be the US's best interest to
level out those situations am ong others before focusing on som ething as trivial as AI data collection.
