General Comment
I absolutely DO NOT CONDONE the use of m y work or anyone else's work that was m ade with their very own hands, m inds, and
souls. Google and ChatGPT, all you greedy corporate pigs, you don't own the right to use our work without our perm ission and you never
will. Your lack of com passion shows you have no soul and could never understand what it's like to truly be creative. You piggyback off of
our work, stealing what WE MADE to try and m ake m oney, while at the sam e tim e claim ing we are not needed.If you don't need us, why
steal from  us? Well unfortunately for you, WE DON'T NEED YOU. WE WILL CREATE NO MATTER WHAT YOU GREEDY
SPINELESS TALENTLESS COWARDS DO.
AI is garbage and it always will be.
