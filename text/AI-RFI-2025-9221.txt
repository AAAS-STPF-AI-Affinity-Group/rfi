General Comment
Hum an flourishing and econom ic com petitiveness are best served by protecting, defending and strengthening Am ericans' rights to the value
of their original creations, as directed by the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, which grants Congress the power "to prom ote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for lim ited Tim es to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings
and Discoveries." The licensing of creative output for the training of generative "artificial intelligence" is and ought to be reserved to the
creators of that work, and for another party to use that output for such purpose without licensing the right to do so from  the creators is a
form  of intellectual property theft.
The argum ents of com panies developing "AI" system s acknowledge the value of authors' and artists' work when they say they can't train
their system s without it, yet they deny the value of that sam e work when asked to rem unerate those authors and artists who created it. If
the governm ent considers leadership in the developm ent of "AI" system s to be a public good, then to officially sanction the past, present
and future developm ent of these system s without any paym ent given to the authors and artists on whose work the system s are trained is a
taking of private (intellectual) property for public use without just com pensation, and thus a violation of the Fifth Am endm ent. Under no
circum stances should this be allowed.
