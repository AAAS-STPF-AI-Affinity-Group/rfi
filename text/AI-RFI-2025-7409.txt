General Comment
I DO NOT BELIEVE AI WILL HELP THE US. It destroys resources that will take years to restore for the end result of som ething that
a person can do on their own for less than $5. It has been periodically proven to steal from  artists without consent in order to train it tim e
and tim e again. If you think you are im m une to AI stealing from  you, you wil find yourself m istaken. The m odern day AI will take
everything from  you to m ake a pale im itation of your life''s work. It will get things wrong and not even realize it unlike a hum an.
EVERYONE will be affected negatively by it.
