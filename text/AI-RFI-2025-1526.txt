General Comment
I think that Generative AI as it currently exists is a m assive infringem ent on the rights of creators and sm all businesses who m ake their
livings off of their craft. It m akes subpar content but the m ajority of people don’t care because they think it’s cheap and easy, even though
it costs a m assive am ount of energy, especially im age generation. AI harm s sm all businesses and dam ages the econom y by taking business
away from  them  and thus circulating less m oney.
