As an author, I strongly object to the use of pirated copies of my books to train AI to write in
my style, without my permission.
This has been done to thousands of authors to the detriment of our livelihood and in violation
of copyright law.
I see no reason why the US government should prioritize the "rights" of machines over the
rights of human content creators.
