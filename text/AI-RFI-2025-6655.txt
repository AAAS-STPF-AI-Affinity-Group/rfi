General Comment
This so-called “artificial intelligence” software is nothing m ore than an autom ated plagiarism  program  for people without talent to
synthesize the COPYWRITTEN hard earned lifetim e work of artists, writers, m usicians and anim ators into a supposedly “new” product
for low effort hobbyists to pass off as original. It is WRONG, it is ABJECT PLAGIARISM and needs STRICT REGULATION to
protect the artisans like m yself who have spent their lifetim es learning their trade.
