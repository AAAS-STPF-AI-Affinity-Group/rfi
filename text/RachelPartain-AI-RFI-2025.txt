I write you in support of our existing copyright laws. If AI cannot work without stealing from
creators, it should not exist. Neither I nor anyone I know will knowingly watch, read, orconsume the creations of this large-scale plagiarism machine, and making the theft legal willonly solidify our position.
Thank you,Rachel Partain
