 
   As AI continues to expand across industries, the lack of standardized messaging formats hinders 
interoperability, governance, and transparency. We propose the creation of an extensible JSON -
based AI Messaging Standard, similar to the ACORD standard used in  the insurance industry, to 
define structured electronic exchanges between AI systems, regulatory bodies, and enterprise 
applications. This standard should be designed with extensibility, allowing organizations to 
define private extensions to support propr ietary or domain -specific AI use cases while 
maintaining interoperability with the broader ecosystem. Key Areas for Standardization: - AI 
Model Input Prompts – Standardizing prompt structures ensures consistent model interactions, 
improving reliability and  reducing ambiguity across AI platforms. - AI Model Responses – 
Establishing a common format for AI -generated outputs allows seamless integration with 
enterprise applications, regulatory compliance systems, and multi -AI workflows. - AI Model 
Cards – Providing a standardized format for AI documentation, including model origin, training 
data sources, performance benchmarks, bias detection, and ethical considerations. - AI Audit 
Logs – Defining structured records of AI decisions (inputs, outputs, confidence sc ores) for 
compliance and risk mitigation purposes. - Explainability and Justifications – Creating a 
framework for AI -generated explanations, ensuring transparency in high -stakes decision -making 
(e.g., finance, healthcare, legal). - AI System Performance Me trics – Standardizing reporting for 
model latency, drift detection, fairness assessments, and operational efficiency. - AI Governance 
and Compliance – Structuring governance and regulatory compliance reporting in a machine -
readable format for auditing and oversight. - Federated AI Learning & Model Sharing – Enabling 
secure model training and transfer protocols to facilitate collaborative AI development without 
compromising privacy. - AI Agents and Multi -Agent Coordination – Establishing structured 
messaging  protocols for AI agents to communicate effectively in automated workflows. 
Extensibility in the AI Messaging Standard: - Organizations should have the ability to extend the 
standard with private extensions that allow for custom fields, proprietary model m etadata, and 
organization -specific governance rules. - Extensions should be structured in a way that ensures 
backward compatibility, preventing interoperability issues across different AI platforms. - A 
governance mechanism should be in place to encourage industry-wide adoption of common 
extensions, ensuring best practices while allowing innovation. Benefits of an Extensible JSON -
Based AI Messaging Standard: - Interoperability – Ensures AI services, platforms, and 
regulatory bodies can communicate effective ly. - Transparency & Trust – Facilitates auditing 
and oversight of AI decision -making processes. - Efficiency & Scalability – Reduces 
development and compliance costs by providing a universal messaging framework. - Security & 
Privacy – Supports encrypted a nd structured AI data transmission in compliance with 
regulations. - Customization & Innovation – Provides a structured but flexible framework that 
allows organizations to tailor AI messaging to their specific needs. Call to Action: We urge 
policymakers to  prioritize the development of this standard, bringing together AI stakeholders, 
industry leaders, and government agencies to ensure AI systems operate in a structured, secure, 
and transparent manner while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate evolvin g AI 
applications. We appreciate your consideration and look forward to contributing to this initiative.  
 
As AI systems increasingly influence critical areas such as healthcare, transportation, finance, 
and infrastructure, the requirements for ongoing monitoring of AI systems that impact safety 
remain unclear. To ensure reliability and public trust, policies a nd regulations should explicitly 


 
   call for continuous automatic monitoring for AI systems where safety is a concern. Key Reasons 
for Continuous Automatic Monitoring: - AI systems used in safety -critical applications should be 
monitored in real -time or near -real-time to detect anomalies, fa ilures, or unexpected behaviors 
that could lead to harm. - Periodic or manual monitoring approaches are insufficient for AI -
driven systems that operate dynamically and make real -time decisions. - Automated monitoring 
can provide continuous oversight, detec ting bias, drift, or security vulnerabilities as they arise, 
rather than after an incident occurs. - Industries such as aviation, autonomous vehicles, and 
medical AI require rapid response mechanisms that only automated monitoring can support. 
Clarity Need ed in Policy: - Define explicit requirements for continuous monitoring versus 
periodic audits, ensuring regulatory expectations align with the nature of AI operations. - 
Establish industry -agnostic guidelines for automated AI monitoring, applicable across sectors 
where AI impacts human safety. - Require AI developers and operators to implement real -time 
anomaly detection, logging, and alert mechanisms to ensure rapid intervention when needed. - 
Provide clear compliance frameworks that specify monitoring exp ectations for different AI risk 
levels. Call to Action: We urge policymakers to explicitly address the necessity of continuous 
automatic monitoring in AI safety regulations to close existing gaps in oversight and ensure AI 
systems remain safe, reliable, an d trustworthy throughout their lifecycle. I appreciate your 
consideration, please reach out any time to discuss.
