General Comment
If AI technology cannot exist without legalized theft, then it sim ply shouldn't exist. There is no reason for legalizing plagiarism  for a private
industry beyond blatant greed, and even with a blank check to steal the technology will STILL be nowhere near functional enough to be
profitable.
