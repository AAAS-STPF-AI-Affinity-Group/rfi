General Comment
Generative AI is an insult to art itself. If left unregulated, artists will have no control over how their art is used in generative AI m odeling.
Generative AI com panies will be able to thieve art from  any artist and use it in their m odels without perm ission, ruining the careers that
independent artists give their lives to. Sensible regulation for generative AI is absolutely essential, and there is no future for Am erican
artists if we leave generative AI unregulated.
