General Comment
Not only would the rem oval of copyright law affect the hard working and producer of Am erica, it would also allow countries (like China
cited here) to access those m aterials freely.
Making this seem  like a bailout of Am erican AI com pany avoiding court cases they have been slowly failing at.
Copyright gives power to our creatives to be protected both in our country and overseas.
Rem oving that protection would prove disastrous to keeping our creatives willing to work inside the US, and would dam age m any
industries that are Am erica's strengths.
