General Comment
To even consider enabling private corporations to m ake use of works of all kinds while sim ultaneously denying preservationists, archivists,
and digital scholars the sam e data is inherently contradictory, exploitative, and anti-Am erican. 
Said AI corporations that exist have already dem onstrated in courts and in public announcem ents a disregard for intellectual property, and
as such, should not be perm itted carte-blanche circum vention of rules that others follow in good faith.
This sim ply cannot pass, and m ust be stopped. I im plore you.
