General Comment
As an academ ic and a creative, I am  entirely against generative AI. It scrapes the hard work of artists and scholars without their consent,
bypassing copyright and plagiarism  laws. The US can be a leader in AI developm ent for purposes other than creating art. Why do we
need a com puter to generate art when that is the basis of the hum an soul? I'd rather have com puters work on m edical research, like curing
cancer, or environm ental issues, like addressing m icroplastics.
