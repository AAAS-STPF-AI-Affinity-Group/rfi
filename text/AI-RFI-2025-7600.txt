General Comment
As a private citizen I am  deeply concerned by the entire rationale of this executive order calling for revoking President Biden's Executive
Order 14110 im posing what this notice calls "im posing burdensom e governm ent requirem ents" on AI developm ent. 
Rather than im posing burdensom e regulations, the prior Adm inistration's sole focus was on protecting the intellectual property of Am erican
writers, artists, and other creators, to ensure that the fruits of their intellectual labor are not devoured by artificial intelligence to be spat out
in the form  of regurgitated large language m odels and predictive text. Am erican intellectual and artistic contributions have brought the
world untold econom ic and cultural benefits for centuries, through a m odel that protects intellectual property for the creators and their
heirs for a lifetim e before entering the public dom ain. 
President Trum p's Executive Order 14179 will whittle away at those intellectual property protections and the econom ic base that sustains
writers, editors, artists, and other creative industries -- the very industries that have strengthened Am erican cultural leadership globally for
decades and created im m ense cultural and econom ic wealth for our nation. Strong IP protections are a foundation of our legal system ; in
China and Africa and the form er Soviet bloc, creators could not benefit from  their efforts because their work would be im m ediately stolen,
adapted, interpolated into other m edia, and printed or reproduced without their consent, approval, or revenue sharing. The United States
would quickly m ove in that direction if AI can im m ediately absorb, interpolate, rem ix, and reproduce content directly driven by the original
creators' efforts, without appropriate consent and recom pense.
