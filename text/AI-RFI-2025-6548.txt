General Comment
AI should be banned from  using artists works. AI program s using others art, words, voices, and likeness should be illegal. It's unethical in
every way. It's not cool, it's not at all about being 'accessible' to disabled com m unities either. Disabled people have been and will always
be m aking art without AI.
AI has ruined so m uch and it needs to stop. AI has been m aking the US look like absolute fools. It's not the good look you think it is. It's
an extrem ely cowardice and ignorant look.
