General Comment
This request can and is likely to be used to plagiarize the public and the average Am erican's work. If left unchecked and unregulated, there
is a potential that people will have the rights of their works rem oved and assim ilated into an algorithm . Thus, there should be both
regulations and com pensation to add to the work of AI. It should be repeated that the invitation to collaborate on AI is purely an optional
request instead of a dem and by higher ups through an ultim atum  or other threat to a person's livelihood. Therefore, there should, at the
very least, be regulations and constant checks to ensure that the data used to train and test these m odels be given with consent through
proper docum entation from  all involved parties and sources.
