General Comment
Allowing AI to legally steal is practically handing everyone's hard work to som eone else to use without any credit, or gratitude. Corporate
businesses would be able to abuse this, along with other com panies. Videogam e Developers, Hollywood, all of them  would rather use AI
despite it's m ajor flaws in cohesion. This would hurt jobs, people m aking m oney from  drawing and m aking art as their own business, and
the artistic industry as a whole. I do not and will never support AI stealing art. It's an awful practice, enforces laziness, and brings out the
negligence of doing better with practice.
