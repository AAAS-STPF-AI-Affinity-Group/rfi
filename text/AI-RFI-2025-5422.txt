General Comment
Not only AI com pletely ruins the environm ent and uses so m uch electricity, AI voids m ajority of it's products from  hum an passion or
em otion. Leaving everything to be artificial, fake, and none caring. Now a good usage for AI is within the m edical field and is for detecting
and finding a cure for cancer and other illnesses. AI should not be used for writting papers, m aking art, m aking m ovies or cartoons; AI
should not be used as a replacem ent for hum ans and hum an jobs. It should only be used for assistance to help better the world than to
destroy m edia literacy and hum an em otion. As well as using AI for anything a creative hum an can do is just lazy and non caring.
