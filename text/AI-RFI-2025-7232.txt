General Comment
If this product cannot exist by stealing work from  others, then it doesn't need to exist. If a bank said that they couldn't exist without
robbing people, the governm ent wouldn't (and shouldn't) step in to change the law for them  to function. The Free Market is speaking
when we say that we don't want Generative AI and it's not worth the cost (to the environm ent and the livelihoods it steals from  to
function). Let them  fail.
