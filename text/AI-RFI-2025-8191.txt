General Comment
This rush for AI only seeks to benefit Big Tech in their aim s to elim inate the need for hiring flesh and blood workers, robbing them  of the
protections they have over their creative properties; the rightful ownership of their own output. 
To allow an outside entity and ill actors to freely source content without consent is a m oral outrage and is not som ething that should be
pam pered by higher governm ent.
