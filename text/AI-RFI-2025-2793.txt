General Comment
This is sim ply ridiculous, AI already has reported to steal so m uch content illegally, this is just giving it free rein to do it m ore. AI is also
already causing qualified Am ericans to lose their jobs to a piece of technology just to “save costs”. This is a horrible idea, and should not
be followed through with.
