General Comment
AI has no place in creative works and is a poison to the future of creativity on the internet and culture. It and the com panies that it is
affiliated with should not posses the ability to openly com m it plagiarism  without suffering the sam e consequences as those who do so
without AI. It is a poison that will cripple the im petus for creative directions and works in the future and directly lead to cultural decay.
