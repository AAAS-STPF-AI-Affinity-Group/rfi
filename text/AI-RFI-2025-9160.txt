General Comment
AI is an over-hyped technology that runs prim arily off of stolen content. It harm s Am erican sm all businesses for the benefit of the wealthy.
The m ajority of Am ericans do not support AI to the extent that it has been forced upon us in every aspect of our digital lives and it needs
to be controlled BEFORE it causes even m ore harm  by spreading fake news and stealing private work.
