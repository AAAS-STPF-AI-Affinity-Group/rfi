General Comment
I do not believe this overhyped product with already dim inishing returns has a place in our future and I do not believe that it needs to steal
from  creative individuals to allow VC backed losers with no vision to profit. 
These com panies are spewing garbage into our inform ation system s while using our precious energy at an escalating rate. We don't want
it.
No.
