General Comment
AI shouldn't have a free pass when it com es to copyright. Either everyone should be effected by it or no one should. The president it sets
by allowing large com panies to com pletely bypass an im portant fact of the law- one that they them selves already use against the people- is
highly hypocritical. They should not be allowed to use the sam e law as a sword and shield when they them selves do not wield it.
