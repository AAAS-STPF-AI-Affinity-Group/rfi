General Comment
If you do this you are killing any and all creative advantage Am erica has, by letting these com panies steal the work of honest Am ericans
you will lose a workforce of creative thinkers. Our nation will be reduced to a regurgitating m ill of cheap knockoffs like China. Protection
of IP rights is im perative to a strong econom y where creative thinking is rewarded. Anything short of protecting IP and copyright in The
United States is a stab in the back to our nation's econom y.
Letting US com panies do this also m eans it's a free for all for out adversaries to do the sam e with Am erican IP.
