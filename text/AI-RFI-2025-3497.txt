General Comment
This is a waste of resources and tim e. We are already seeing vast dim inishing returns in LLM of this size and going around copyright law is
only going to waste m ore m oney in litigation.
This will screw over sm all businesses and only profit a system  that is already being abandoned by the greater tech sector. This is a waste
of m y taxpayer m oney for an adm inistration that is trying to balance the budget. A huge m isstep.
