General Comment
The AI industry is built on stolen data, as LLMs cannot be trained solely on open source inform ation. The copyright owners of this data
did not give consent for their data to be used this way, and allowing the industry to steal invalidates all copyright protections.
In addition, the AI industry is a speculative bubble which will not ever be profitable without governm ent rescue. There is sim ply no m arket
for the tools they offer, which is why they are continuously raising funds instead of selling products.
Finally, the resources required to train and serve these m odels are environm entally disastrous, and will only increase as they grow and
com petitors try to com e to m arket.
There is sim ply no benefit to the people of the United States to support these im m oral com panies and we should let them  try to operate
under the free m arket and existing laws .
