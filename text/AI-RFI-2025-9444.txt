General Comment
Disappointed that this is even being considered. Generative AI works by stealing others’ work and generating its own soulless garbage.
Not only that, but we’ve seen the deepfakes it’s possible with.
Som ething this potentially dangerous should be regulated. There should be accountability, not just for the creatives who are being
exploited and could lose their jobs, but to the people that could be attacked and m isrepresented by this technology.
