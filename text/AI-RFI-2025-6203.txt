General Comment
I strongly oppose rewriting existing copyright law to m ake an exem ption for AI training. Copyright exists to incentivize creation. How will
anyone be incentivized to innovate if their work can be grabbed without proper licensing or consent and used to create a duplicate work
that som eone else can m onetize?
