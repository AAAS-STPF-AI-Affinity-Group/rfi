General Comment
AI does NOT hold a place in the future of the United States. It is actively stealing from  and harm ing people by stealing the creative works
that they rely on for incom e. By allowing com panies such as OpenAI to have as m uch access to creative works that people put im m ense
am ounts of tim e and effort into as they want, it will cause econom ic difficulties for m any, and OpenAI has specified they will not be
requesting perm ission, which m eans they will only be stealing from  people even m ore. This is unethical and should not be allowed under
any circum stances. AI cannot replace people - it cannot replace the quality and care that hum an beings put into everything that they do. If
we choose to rely on AI for m atters such as national security, it will only m ake vital m istakes and errors that will cause m ore harm  than
good, because no m atter how m uch AI is trained, it will never be able to create things like people can. It is not reliable as a source of
inform ation, it is not reliable as an accurate im age generator, it is sim ply not reliable at all for such crucial m atters as national security. Do
not rem ove the guardrails around AI - if anything, m ake the guardrails m ore intensive. Do not allow this country to be run by AI.
