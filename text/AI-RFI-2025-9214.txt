General Comment
Generative AI has no place in responsible science, research, art, or creativity. It is based on theft. It drinks energy and water in m assive
quantities. It m akes up the “facts” it tells you and there’s not always an easy way to tell. It’s going to create confusion and no one will be
able to trust what they find online anym ore.
