General Comment
Training AI m odels with copyrighted m aterial without perm ission or com pensation hurts and underm ines the livelihoods of artists,
photographers, writers, and even com panies holding intellectual property. It is wildly unethical. Furtherm ore, Am ericans deserve better
than generated im ages and texts of questionable quality, which are annoying at best and dangerous at worst, considering that, for exam ple,
deepfakes can exploit wom en and children.
