General Comment
The technology described is not artificial intelligence. The technology described uses existing language and and statistical probability to
generate output. It rem ixes existing hum an creations, nothing m ore. And it does so by clear violation of copyright protections. 
In addition to m ilitary and econom ic power, this country dom inates the world with our cultural strength. Our books, our m ovies, our
m usic, our television. That culture is protected by copyright. Giving perm ission for anyone with this breed of technology to devour and spit
out poor im itations of our culture is asking the rest of the world to step over us and m ake cheap copies of what m akes Am erica great.
Only Am ericans can produce Am erica. Not m achines, or outsiders, and certainly not m achines paid for and run by outsiders.
