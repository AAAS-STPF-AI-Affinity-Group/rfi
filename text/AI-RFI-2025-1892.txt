General Comment
AI should not have access to all copyright works. They do not have the right nor reason to destroy copyright, plus it will only do m ore
harm  than good. If they get rid of copyright that m eans their software becom es free gam e too. Don’t destroy a huge percentage of the
populations livelihood for one m an who doesn’t even understand what he’s asking for! Please! 
The Fifth Am endm ent to the Constitution provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just com pensation. Art,
books, m usic it’s all our property!
