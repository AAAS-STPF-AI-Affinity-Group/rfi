General Comment
Rem oving any guardrails would be an infringem ent on m y rights and the rights of all Am ericans who enjoy the critical protections that
copyright provides. Allowing unfettered developm ent in this broad m anner is reckless, exploitative, and should not bypass any standard
process of legislature under the guise of "national security." Under no uncertain term s, I am  com pletely opposed to ANY guardrails being
rem oved for the developm ent of AI. AI needs m ore guardrails, not less.
