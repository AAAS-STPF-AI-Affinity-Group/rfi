To Whom It May Concern,
As a creative individual I urge you to pay attention and carefully read other comments of a
similar nature in regards to the AI Action Plan.
A.I. is costly, and wastes tax dollars simply by existing and is a constant disturbance in the
general public and threatens the livelihood of both online and offline spaces. All of this is toprovide small and insignificant benefits that do not benefit the everyday individual in anywaywhatsoever.
Once again, I urge you to carefully listen and review other comments regarding the subject
matter.
Sincerely,
A concerned American
