General Comment
How can you claim  to prom ote “hum an flourishing” when the very foundation of AI generation is exploiting hum ans—nam ely artists,
writers, and other creators? AI m odels are trained on stolen work, taking work from  creatives without their express perm ission. The
developers of these AI generators want to profit off the labor and expertise of artists in order to m ake a quick buck for an inferior
product. 
Those “burdensom e requirem ents” are necessary in order to keep the power and profit in the correct people’s pockets—the people who
are actually creating the work, not these thieves parading as developers. If anything, there needs to be m ore regulations for AI.
Requirem ents that every piece that is used to train the AI m odels has been sourced ethically with express, written consent from  its original
creator. 
In an online clim ate that is already rife with m isinform ation and willful ignorance of facts and science, creating m ore dubious AI generated
writings and im ages will only lead us further into chaos. Our education num bers are laughable on a global level (and will continue to
worsen if the abolishm ent of the Departm ent of Education com es to fruition); leaning into this faulty, biased, and im m orally created AI will
only tank our statistics entirely. 
This is just one of m any short-sighted, profit-driven, and m isguided m issteps that this adm inistration has taken. Proving again and again
that this adm inistration is prioritizing profits over its own people.
