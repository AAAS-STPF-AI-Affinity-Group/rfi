General Comment
I am  the owner and creator of dozens of copyrighted works. Why should a private com pany be allowed to steal m y work for their own
use without m y perm ission and fair com pensation to m e? Moreso, these com panies intend to act in direct com petition to m e, using m y
works and that of other authors as a training tool to create com peting works at a rate orders of m agnitude higher than I could ever create
som ething. If I were to copy som eone's work and attem pt to profit from  it, I would rightfully be sued and even arrested. Why should we
allow AI com panies to do so at a m assive scale?
