General Comment
AI-Generated content is like an artistic biohazard that m akes whatever it's used on look cheap and lower than low quality because no real
work was put into it. At least som ething bad but still m ade by real hum ans looks better than anything m ade by AI-Generated im agry.
It's also a hotbed of plagiarism . If this country has any respect for the arts, AI-Generated im agery, "deepfakes", and ai-generated voices
would not be funded. It should be at the very least, disavowed.
