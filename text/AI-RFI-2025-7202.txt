General Comment
As an artist, as an illustrator, this is nothing but theft. I agree with m y m any fellow artists that this is not fair use and is directly infringing
upon our rights and our ability to use our finely honed craft practiced over years and years and years to m ake a profit. If it takes m e a
lifetim e to develop a style that works and is profitable and it takes a random  AI bro less than a day to feed all the publicly available work
I’ve done into an algorithm  to steal from  m e- that’s a huge theft.
