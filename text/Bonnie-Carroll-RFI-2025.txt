Any plan for dominance in AI must have a major consideration for the accessibility and quality 
of data to be used. The National Academy of Sciences has two groups that focus on data: US 
National Committee for CODATA which has strong international access an d the Board on 
Research Data and Information. It is recommended that these groups be included in discussions 
on national AI policy and the importance of quality, FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable 
and Reuseable -https://www.go -fair.org/fair -principles /) data. Other countries around the world 
including European and China are far ahead of us in advancing data curation.
