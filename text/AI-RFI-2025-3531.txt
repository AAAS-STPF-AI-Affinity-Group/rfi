General Comment
Nobody should have the right to take som eone else’s hard work for them selves without paying for com pensation. Artists who work
prim arily in online spaces are unable to defend them selves already from  petty thieves and others passing their work off as their own; yet
now with the rise of AI generated im ages people are able to have their work stolen in m assive data scrapes, where every im age, ever
m om ent of work an artist, writer, singer, or actor puts into their work can be copied and used without their perm ission or giving them
com pensation. 
Supporting acts like this is a horrible and im m oral practice, with the future of our society defined by how we react to and use new tools.
This ethical failing of representatives to defend the m ost sim ple of civil rights, ownership of one’s own work, is a slap in the face to all of us
who have worked hard to create unique and distinctly Am erican art. AI generated im ages are not art, they are m ath used to predict things
that should look nice, but the data is not provided willingly. 
If you vote to allow this through, then you are no better than a com m on thief stealing from  those who would starve for the pride they feel in
their work.
