General Comment
AI as it has been called lately is not intelligent. It is sim ply a probability engine that gives words that are likely to sound like they are the
answer to questions posed of it. It is a trick. Executives, governm ents, and regular people alike have all been duped so that som e people
can cash in. Didn't be tricked. Didn't fall for it. It's not the future. It's a grift. It robs creatives of their livelihood. It can't explain itself. It
rem oves blam e from  people who should be m aking decisions so that they can do im m oral things. It is a national security risk.
