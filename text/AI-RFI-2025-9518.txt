General Comment
Don't Let yourselves be tricked by AI the sam e way people were tricked by cryptocurrency and NFT's. The investm ents in AI are purely
based on speculation, and inevitably like any other bubble, it is going to pop sooner or later. No one actually benefits from  loosening
regulations on AI. It hurts artists who m ake actually creative works that this regulation is trying to m ake it easier to steal. This is a
com plete and total dism antling of copyright law, allowing com panies to steal m illions of artists' hard work with no possibility of
repercussions, and no recourse for the artists who had their works stolen. And for what? No one likes AI. AI im ages look terrible, and
lack any of the m eaning that m akes real art special. AI leads to m assive layoffs across m any industries, with little to no new jobs to replace
them . AI chatbots are unreliable, and have in the past told people to eat rocks, or to sm oke while pregnant. If we can't trust AI to even
give sim ple answers accurately, we m ost certainly should not be trying to trust it with the future of our country.
