General Comment
Just don't.
AI is already stealing jobs from  people with diplom as, experience and the desperate need for a well paying career. As well, this m odel has
been proven to be im m ensely flawed with how it relays inform ation, as it reads anything even rem otely related to a subject that would have
no facts or could intentionally be m isleading.
The biggest com plaint will be how it required plagiarism  to even function. If this request goes through, the flood gates will open for stolen
content, as if it wasn't already quite the issue in journalism  and art.
Do not let this pass. Do not let plagiarism  becom e legal. Do not let AI win.
