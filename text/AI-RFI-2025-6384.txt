General Comment
It is essential that the output of Am erica's creative professionals be protected, by copyright law, from  use without com pensation by AI
com panies. If that doesn't happen, Am erican culture will be taken over by floods of cheap AI books and art, and hum an artists and
writers will be unable to earn a living. Am erican culture will literally die.
