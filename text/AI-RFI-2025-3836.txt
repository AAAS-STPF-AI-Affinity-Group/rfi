General Comment
OpenAI and other com panies like them  should never have the ability to train their m odels off of copywritten im ages. These im ages are
subject to certain protections, and these AI tools are not sourcing their training data ethically. They should be forced to pay for the im ages
they train off of, rather than just having access to m illions of peoples' creative works without their consent.
