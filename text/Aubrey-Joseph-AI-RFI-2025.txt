To whom it may concern,
As a taxpaying U.S. citizen, I think that allowing companies to train A.I. using copyrighted
material will only serve to undermine the rights of the people that created that material in thefirst place.
 
We don't need to compare ourselves to China to determine what laws would best serveour
 country. Doesn't China have a reputation for outputting quantity at the cost of quality? Do
we really want to emulate that just to "win" the A.I. race, while simultaneously sacrificingcreativity?
 
We don't know exactly what the long-term ramifications associated with generative artificialintelligence are. Now is not the time to loosen the leash, it is time to tighten it.
 
In summary, I dissent, and I suggest our government does too.  
Thank you,Aubrey Joseph
