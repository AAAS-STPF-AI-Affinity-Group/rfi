General Comment
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
The purpose of copyright is to protect the hard work of creators from  exploitation of others. Allowing any entity, whether an individual,
business, corporation, or whatever to use copyrighted m aterials with im m unity opens these item s up to abuse and would be tantam ount to
theft given what has been seen in the last few years of sm aller scale attem pts of training LLM. 
I am  against granting im m unity of copyrighted work or really any work for the purpose creating, training, or otherwise im plem ented for
generative ai, generative content, or AI in general.
