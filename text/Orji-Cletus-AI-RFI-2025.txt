May I humbly use this opportunity to express my passion and desire to be part of the team of key 
players in the new President Trump's executive order on the development of AI in America and 
around the world . Artificial intelligence programming and develop ment will go a long way in 
finding solutions to many problems all over the world . May I humbly request that the 
development of AI should be made a little open to people around the world for their input . Areas 
to explore are many and major player should n ot limit their request for public input from only 
people in American soil . Their are people in Africa who can make a reasonable contribution to 
the project . Please remember America is the watchdog of the world . Now for me I am in Africa 
(Nigeria) we hav e something to offer as a part of our contribution for the development of the 
project . No one is omniscient to knowledge . Can I be invited to be part of the expanding of 
project for something good can come out from Africa. Thanks Orji Cletus C
