General Comment
Do not im plem ent AI. AI should not hold a place in the future of the US. It is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs,
with false prom ises to fool the public.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican citizen and an artist. It profits off of the theft of art and writing created by actual hum ans who
have spent countless hours honing their skill and perfecting their craft. 
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
