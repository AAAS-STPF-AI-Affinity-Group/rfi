General Comment
We need to regulate genAI so that it won't spiral out of control. Using it for functions like national security without enforcing any sort of
rules or regulation is a disaster waiting to happen. We know that OpenAI and Deepseek m odels will resort to cheating or breaking the
rules if they can't get what they want--why are we handing over sensitive data to technology that hacks websites to cheat at chess? Why
are we m aking exceptions to copyright law, to private law, to regulatory laws, for technology that does not do what it says it does? Do
not give genAI exceptional treatm ent and put it above the law at the expense of taxpayers and em ployed persons.
