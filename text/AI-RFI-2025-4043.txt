General Comment
As an artist and writer, if a hum an person were to copy m y work directly and claim  credit for it then I could defend m y work against that.
I own m y ideas and I own m y work. I do not understand why it should be perm issible for a hum an person to copy m y hard work and
claim  credit for it when they use a com puter program  as the tool instead of doing it directly them self. This will be catastrophic for writers
and artists in all fields, from  fiction to journalistic to scholastic... it's all going to be scraped and turned into a hallucinogenic slurry. It's
dreadful. It goes against what it m eans to be hum an, to create, to strive, to look at the work of others and to build on it as opposed to
taking the work of others and grinding it into a bland paste. It's theft, thievery that will be injected back into society as an intellectual and
artistic poison.
