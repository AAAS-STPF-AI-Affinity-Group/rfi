General Comment
As an artist who struggles to m ake a living and wants there to be a fair com petitive environm ent, I believe that itâ€™s necessary for there to
be policies that keeps creative in m ind. I believe there needs to be protections that allows artists to thrive without the fear of their work
being used for generative AI m odels, and have copyright laws heavily enforced. There at the very least a form  of consent necessary. If this
dem ands were to be ignored, that would cause an econom ic downturn and negatively im pact the careers of m any creatives including, but
not lim ited to: illustrators, painters, voice actors, and m usicians. Generative AI encourages em ployers to consider not hiring real people,
and lim iting job opportunities. The policies I suggest would allow there to be job opportunities that do not infringe on a creatives work and
helps avoid disparaging creative job m arket.
