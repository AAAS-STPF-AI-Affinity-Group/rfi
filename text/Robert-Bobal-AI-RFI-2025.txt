Unleashing American AI Leadership: A Deregulated Framework for Transparent, Secure, and 
Sustainable Growth  
Executive Summary  
President Trump’s January 2025 Executive Order, emphasizing deregulation to foster private -sector 
innovation and ensure AI systems are “free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas,” 
provides a clear directive for bold action. This proposal leve rages the “Everything Blockchain” —a 
decentralized, scalable, and adaptable technology that can transform virtually every sector of the 
economy —alongside artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless energy exchange to create a 
transparent and secure infrastruc ture.  
The “Everything Blockchain” is not just a tool for one industry; it is a universal enabler capable of 
solving systemic challenges across governance, commerce, defense, healthcare, education, 
energy management, and more. By addressing inefficiencies, enhanc ing transparency, and 
automating processes through smart contracts, blockchain becomes the backbone of innovation 
across all sectors.  
This framework focuses on:  
 1. Removing regulatory barriers to accelerate private -sector innovation.  
 2. Enhancing supply chain transparency and efficiency.  
 3. Modernizing education through secure credentialing and personalized learning.  
 4. Revolutionizing healthcare with secure patient data sharing and AI -driven 
diagnostics.  
 5. Optimizing energy use with blockchain -enabled wireless energy exchange.  
 6. Strengthening military logistics, cybersecurity, and predictive capabilities to support 
national defense.  
 7. Demonstrating immediate impact through pilot programs in key sectors.  
By integrating these technologies into its AI Action Plan, the U.S. can achieve rapid implementation 
within the administration’s 180 -day timeline, while solidifying its global leadership in innovation.  
1. The “Everything Blockchain”: A Universal Enabler  
The “Everything Blockchain” is a transformative infrastructure that can be applied across virtually 
every industry to enhance efficiency, security, and transparency. Its adaptability makes it a critical 


 
   tool for solving systemic challenges in governance, commerce, defense logistics, healthcare 
delivery, education systems, energy management, and more.  
Key Features of the Everything Blockchain:  
 • Immutable Record -Keeping: Ensures data integrity by creating tamper -proof records 
for transactions or operations.  
 • Smart Contracts: Automates processes by executing predefined actions when 
conditions are met (e.g., trade settlements or insurance claims).  
 • Interoperability: Connects disparate systems across industries to enable seamless 
collaboration.  
 • Scalability: Adapts to the needs of small businesses or large -scale government 
operations.  
 • Post-Quantum Security: Protects sensitive data from future quantum computing 
threats.  
2. Alignment with Trump’s Priorities  
A. Removing Regulatory Barriers  
 • The proposal eliminates unnecessary regulations that stifle private -sector 
innovation by streamlining compliance requirements across industries like healthcare and supply 
chains.  
 • Deregulation encourages private investment in blockchain solutions while reducing 
government friction in deploying advanced technologies.  
B. Ensuring Ideological Neutrality  
 • Blockchain ensures transparency by recording all decisions on immutable ledgers 
that are free from manipulation or bias.  
 • Liquid democracy enables equitable participation in governance without centralized 
control or undue influence.  
C. Simplification for Immediate Impact  
 • The proposal prioritizes actionable pilot programs in supply chain management, 
healthcare efficiency, military logistics optimization, and wireless energy exchange to deliver quick 
wins within the 180 -day timeline.  
D. Strengthening Economic Competitiveness  
 • Blockchain -AI integration reduces costs by automating processes like contract 
execution and predictive analytics.  
 • Wireless energy exchange incentivizes renewable energy adoption while reducing 
operational costs for data centers powering AI systems.  


 
   E. Enhancing National Security  
 • Blockchain secures military supply chains by providing traceability of assets (e.g., 
weapons systems or humanitarian aid) during conflicts like Ukraine.  
 • Predictive analytics powered by AI improves battlefield readiness by forecasting 
supply needs months ahead of time.  
F. Building on Existing Policy Frameworks  
 • This proposal builds on Trump’s first -term successes (e.g., the 2019 Executive Order 
on Maintaining Leadership in Artificial Intelligence) while addressing gaps left by rescinded Biden -
era policies.  
3. Key Challenges Addressed  
Governance Challenges  
 1. Overregulation stifling private -sector innovation.  
 2. Lack of transparency in decision -making processes.  
 3. Centralized control limiting equitable participation.  
Supply Chain Challenges  
 1. Inefficiencies caused by manual processes.  
 2. Fraud risks undermining trust in global trade.  
 3. Regulatory complexity slowing cross -border operations.  
Military Challenges  
 1. Limited visibility into pre -positioned materials during conflicts.  
 2. Delays caused by outdated tracking systems for military aid.  
 3. Vulnerabilities in securing sensitive data against cyber threats.  
Healthcare Challenges  
 1. Data silos limiting interoperability across providers.  
 2. Security risks exposing sensitive patient information.  
 3. Excessive oversight delaying deployment of life -saving technologies.  
Energy Challenges  
 1. Inefficient energy consumption in AI infrastructure.  
 2. Centralized control limiting peer -to-peer trading opportunities.  
 3. Rising demand exacerbating environmental concerns.  


 
   4. Proposed Solution  
The “Everything Blockchain” provides an integrated solution by combining deregulation with 
advanced technologies:  
 1. Post-Quantum Security  
 • Protects critical infrastructures like power grids and military communications from 
quantum computing threats.  
 2. Smart Contracts  
 • Automates transactions across industries (e.g., real estate sales or insurance 
claims) to reduce costs and errors.  
 3. Military Logistics Optimization  
 • Tracks military assets like weapons systems or humanitarian aid with blockchain -
enabled traceability during conflicts (e.g., Ukraine).  
 • Predictive analytics forecasts future supply needs based on battlefield conditions or 
equipment wear rates.  
 4. Wireless Energy Exchange
