General Comment
Generative AI is a theft m achine, there's no other way to describe it. It uses copyrighted m aterials without consent, and rem oving the need
for consent kills art, artists, and m akes copyright effectively useless. Don't allow AI com panies to dictate what they can do with other
people's property.
