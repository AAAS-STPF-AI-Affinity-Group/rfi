I believe in order for the US to remain at the forefront of development of high quality models,  
both large language or otherwise, there will eventually need to be  a way for the model to  
autonomously tag its own data, in addition to the removal of any AI generated data from its  
dataset. These are both essential to ensure the AI does not poison itself on low quality data,  
which will result in a decline in quality. Acquiring high quality data will be essential to  
pioneering this new field. Advertising isn't a field I am familiar with, but using audio data  
from cookies and transcribing it, as well as any user data from apple and google(both collect  
and log every user's conversations with their personal assistants) could potentially see  
improvements in the quality of generations.
