General Comment
I do not want AI to use m y content without perm ission. If others are m aking m oney off of m y work I deserve the right to sue them  for
copyright infridgem ent there so absolutely be no place for the governm ent to use m y work in the end. We should also not be using
som ething that works 70% of the tim e and uses reddit data
