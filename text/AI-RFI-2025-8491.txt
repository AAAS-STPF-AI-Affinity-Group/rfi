General Comment
Generative AI and all future developm ents of this technology need to be held accountable and responsible via regulation. Already we are
seeing m isuse and m ishandling of this tech for use in m isinform ation and scam s, and this usage will continue to worsen if private AI
com panies are not held responsible for what can and cannot be produced with their tech. Additionally, it has already been proven that this
tech was developed and trained using m ostly copyrighted m aterials, as well as the real likenesses (vocal and visual) of persons alive and
deceased. To allow the continued use of this tech we need to m ake sure com panies are sourcing their libraries of what their m odels are
trained on ethically and with the consent of all parties. Otherwise we are allowing m ass theft of individual work, creativity, and in som e
cases identity. This cannot continue.
