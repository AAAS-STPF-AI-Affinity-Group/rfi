General Comment
As a professional artist, I believe training AI should only rely on im ages that are given with consent, otherwise it is extrem ely unethical and
illegal to steal artistsâ€™ hard work and identity. Please reconsider and ensure AI is developed ethically. I shudder at the world we are
creating in which art is taken away from  hum ans.
