General Comment
Narrow AI (ANI) is an invaluable task-specific intelligence. I welcom e ANI and use it, but users m ust have the right to designate data
sources by type, plus the ability to include and exclude specific sources m anually. For exam ple, to exclude the Google.com  index from  all
query searches due to its extensive political bias. 
Also, all online ANI apps m ust be m andated to perform  Tor browser-level anonym ous data searches without sharing personal
inform ation, IP address, or anything else. 
General AI (AGI) m atches or exceeds hum an intelligence across diverse tasks, dem onstrating reasoning, creativity, and self-im provem ent.
The concern is that AGI is created in the im age of its m aker, and if that m aker is evil, so will its AI progeny. 
The threat with AGI here is the creation of a real-life Skynet, as featured in the Term inator m ovies, which represents a clear and present
danger to hum anity. Those who pursue its developm ent should be prosecuted as vigorously as those who keep child pornography on their
com puters.
