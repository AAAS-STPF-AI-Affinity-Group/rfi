General Comment
I do NOT consent to allowing AI to steal copy written m aterials. AI needs to respect intellectual property and not engage in any activity
that involves m ass theft. If the AI business m odel collapses because it is not allowed to steal, then so be it. This is the expectation that
m ost businesses in the US need to adhere to, and AI com panies do not deserve any special privileges.
