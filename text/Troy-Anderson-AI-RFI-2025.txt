I request that you please reconsider your plans to remove any and all barriers on the
development of AI, and for said restrictions to remain in place for the foreseeable future. Howexactly does this benefit America? Will this help end the homelessness crisis? Lower thenational debt? Feed the poor? I fail to see how this is what the country needs.
You are well aware that these AI models rely on the work of countless people, artists or
otherwise, many of which are protected under copyright law, something companies fight toothand nail to enforce, being upheld to the point it is considered a crimminal offense whenviolated in some instances. Why is it then that this is any different?
I also worry this may set an unfair precedent that when its a matter of 'national security',
something I imagine was kept vague on purpose, big tech companies can swoop in an use thehard work of others and give them nothing in return, not even giving them the option of optingin or out. Again, why is it that copyrighted material and intellectual properties are nowsuddenly free to be used by these companies without payment or even negotiation, when sucha practice is grounds for legal action.
This may not be the first time you've gotten a message like this, and don't expect it to be the
last.
