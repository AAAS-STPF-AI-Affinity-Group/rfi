General Comment
While I can appreciate the United States always progressing towards technological advancem ents, I believe AI is the opposite of such. AI
relies on theft and plagiarism , which is a direct threat to jobs in the m arketplace, including digital art, anim ation, film , photography, m usic,
and voice over, to nam e a few. In addition, AI has becom e a weapon used to falsify inform ation and create fake evidence, in an attem pt
to sabotage the reputation and im age of individuals, such as Taylor Swift, Elon Musk, and President Trum p, to nam e a few. AI and its use
in m aking healthcare decisions for Am ericans led to the assassination of a CEO. AI uses the im ages of doctors, governm ent leaders, and
influencers to broadcast m isinform ation to affect the public view on certain issues and topics. AI has absolutely NO PLACE in the m odern
world, nor will it in the future. So long as it continues to be pushed, it will continue to hurt and m ake obsolete.
