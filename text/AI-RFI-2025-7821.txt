General Comment
I'm  a writer and so-called "AI" is plagiarism , full stop. Big tech com panies and their CEOs hope to use this technology to profit off the
hard work of people in creative fields. This technology can do nothing but violate copyright. It can never create anything original. At best it
can only disguise the fact that it is regurgitating m ashed-up stolen m aterial.
