General Comment
I am  writing in to com m ent on m y disapproval of this plan for rem oving restrictions set in place on the developm ent of AI. AI needs
proper restrictions in place in order to prevent m isinform ation being even m ore widespread through the use of it. In an age where it is
increasingly becom ing difficult to separate truth from  fiction, loosening restrictions placed on AI will allow com panies to generate im ages
or videos of fictitious events to sway the public into believing their political biases. 
This bill also threatens the livelihoods of anyone who relies on ownership of their ideas through copyright. Writers, artists, film m akers,
photographers, and m any other people would have their creations scraped by AI with no say of their own, allowing AI com panies to
profit off the hard work of countless individuals.
