General Comment
AI needs to be heavily regulated and never allowed to harm  a hum an being. To m ake it clear: 
+ It shou ld never be al lowed in any creati ve field nor shou ld it be al lowed to take jobs from human bei ngs when qual ity of life is
directly  tied to income, and we already have income inequal ity.
+Get it the f&^% out of my spaces. It shou ld not be al lowed to monitor, spy on, or falsely flag Americans (w hich it often has, in
criminal profiling cases they've wrongfully flagged innocent ci vilians).
+ It shou ld only be used to identify cancer and other such pursu its, to facilitate in early treatment and safety of the human
popu lation.
Tell windows to get its f&^% AI out of my face and out of our lives. Tell the tech bros to get it out of our electron ics before we
sm ash it out.
