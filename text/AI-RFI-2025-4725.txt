General Comment
Currently, our nation does not have robust fram eworks for ensuring that AI developm ent occurs in a responsible and sustainable way. AI
currently operates under a fram ework of theft and copyright violation, and I believe that this will only exacerbate the issue of illegal
developm ent and usage. This is a danger to Am erican jobs and clearly a schem e cooked up by wealthy oligarchs with no loyalty to the
Am erican people who care only for their own dollar. I am  strongly opposed to this and believe it is antithetical to fostering true Am erican
innovation or bolstering real Am erican industries or creativity. It m akes our nation look inept on the world stage to be so reliant on AI and
to flounder around without even having any plan except to cede m ore and m ore power to a handful of individuals.
