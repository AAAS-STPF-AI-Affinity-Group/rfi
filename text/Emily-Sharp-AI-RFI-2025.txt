Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on the Development of an AI Action Plan. I urge 
the government to prioritize the following: Resource efficiency and environmental impact: 
Prioritize developing resource -efficient systems, particularly concerni ng water conservation, heat 
management, and responsible use practices. Implement innovative cooling solutions for data 
centers to mitigate their impact on local communities. Ensure methods used don't generate toxic 
impacts on these communities. Encourage r esearch into energy -efficient algorithms and 
hardware. Data privacy: Establish strict regulations to prevent the sale or unauthorized access of 
individual data input into AI systems by companies or government entities. Allow for carefully 
controlled use of  data for training purposes while protecting individual privacy. Inclusive 
decision-making: Ensure a comprehensive variety of expert perspectives, including scientists, 
creatives, and professionals from fields that AI models aim to replicate, are involved in shaping 
policies and development. Ethical development: Develop comprehensive ethical guidelines for 
AI development to prevent exploitation of vulnerable populations and ensure fairness in AI 
applications. Promote transparent and explainable AI systems, especially in critical areas like 
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. Workforce transition and education: Implement policies 
to support workforce retraining and education programs to help workers adapt to an AI -driven 
economy. Address concerns about  human job displacement through proactive measures and 
support systems. Again, involve these sectors in design of the support systems and retraining 
programs. International collaboration: Pursue regulatory alignment with international partners to 
develop a  common, technology -neutral definition of AI and a shared risk -based approach to AI 
regulation. Establish joint R&D projects with international partners to tackle global challenges. 
Engage in the development of global governance frameworks for AI, such as an 
intergovernmental panel on AI. Safety and security: Develop robust safety measures and security 
protocols to prevent AI systems from being misused or compromised. Enhance international 
collaboration on AI safety and security measures. Retain valuable pa rts of previous policies: 
Maintain and build upon the key elements of the Biden -Harris AI Executive Order 14110, 
including safety and security standards, privacy protections, equity and civil rights 
considerations, consumer protection measures, support for  affected workers, and guidelines for 
responsible government use of AI.
