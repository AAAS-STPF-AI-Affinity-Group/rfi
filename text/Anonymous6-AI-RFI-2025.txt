Dear Faisal D'Souza and the NITRD NCO Team, Thank you for the opportunity to provide input 
on the development of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. I appreciate the 
Administrationâ€™s efforts to ensure that the United States remains a global leader in AI innovation 
while addressing the societal implications of this transformative technology. My comments focus 
on two critical areas of concern: the energy and environmental impact of AI and the effect of AI 
on jobs and the workforce. 1. Energy and Environmental Impact of AI The rapid growth of AI 
has led to significant increases in energy consumption, particularly from data centers and the 
training of large -scale AI models. This raises serious environmental concerns,  as the carbon 
footprint of AI infrastructure contributes to climate change. To address this, I urge the 
Administration to prioritize the following actions in the AI Action Plan: Incentivize Energy -
Efficient AI Development: Encourage the private sector to adopt energy -efficient practices in AI 
model training and deployment, such as optimizing algorithms, using renewable energy sources, 
and investing in energy -efficient hardware. Establish Environmental Standards for AI 
Infrastructure: Develop and enforce st andards for data centers and AI -related infrastructure to 
minimize their environmental impact, including limits on carbon emissions and requirements for 
sustainable energy use. Promote Research into Green AI: Fund research initiatives focused on 
reducing t he energy consumption of AI systems, such as developing low -power AI models and 
exploring alternative computing paradigms. 2. Impact of AI on Jobs and the Workforce The 
widespread adoption of AI has the potential to disrupt labor markets, leading to job di splacement 
in certain sectors while creating new opportunities in others. To ensure that AI benefits all 
Americans, I believe the government must take proactive steps to protect workers and promote 
equitable economic growth. Specifically, I recommend the f ollowing: Mandate Human Oversight 
in Critical Industries: Require companies to maintain human workers in roles where AI is 
deployed, particularly in sectors like healthcare, education, and transportation, where human 
judgment and empathy are essential. Inv est in Workforce Reskilling and Education: Allocate 
resources to programs that help workers transition to AI -driven economies, including vocational 
training, STEM education, and lifelong learning initiatives. Encourage Public -Private 
Partnerships: Foster c ollaboration between the government, industry, and educational institutions 
to identify emerging job opportunities and develop training programs that align with the skills 
needed in an AI -driven workforce. In conclusion, while AI holds immense potential to  drive 
innovation and economic growth, it is imperative that we address its energy and environmental 
impacts and ensure that its benefits are shared equitably across society. By incorporating these 
recommendations into the AI Action Plan, the Administratio n can strike a balance between 
fostering innovation and safeguarding the well -being of people and the planet. Thank you for 
considering my input. I look forward to seeing how the AI Action Plan evolves to address these 
critical issues.
