General Comment
"AI" is plagiarism  writ large.
"AI" is the theft of intellectual property.
"AI is the m isuse of natural resources, including the egregious m isuse of water. Som e data centers built to support AI activities are already
sucking their m unicipalities dry.
Statem ents that all these things have to keep happening in order to keep innovating or som ething are just bonkers. I strongly oppose this
policy.
(also is there really anyone left at NSF who's actually reading this, or do I need to wave at Elon and DOGE as I write this?)
