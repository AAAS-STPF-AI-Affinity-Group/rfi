AI has already affected my life negatively across the board. It steals from my capabilities
to produce freelance creative writing work and make a living on my own.   I do not believe
AI has a place in the future of the US. I do not know a single person who enjoys what AIhas brought to the table, it is overhyped and overvalued.
 
Thanks,Matthew Good
