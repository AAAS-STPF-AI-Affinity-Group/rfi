General Comment
I firm ly do not believe that anyone, least of all giant m ultibillion dollar corporations, should be given a free pass to use and resell
copyrighted content as they please without perm ission from  or com pensation to the original authors. This type of exem ption flies in the
face of everything our copyright system  is built on, and will only serve to stifle hum an innovation, creativity, and ingenuity. Generative AI
does not "create" anything new, just regurgitate (often incorrectly!) existing inform ation. It is a passing fad given an im portant sounding
nam e, and I don't see this type of AI being im portant to our country's future. Please reconsider allowing OpenAI and others to skirt
around copyright law, as the potential for severe harm  to jobs, to art, and to people far outweighs any benefits.
