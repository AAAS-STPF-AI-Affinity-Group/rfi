General Comment
So-called "artificial intelligence," m isleading as the nam e m ay be, is terrible. It is terrible in every way. I'm  an artist, m usician, and writer,
and all of these pursuits are threatened by the senseless spread of this algorithm ically-generated slop. Not only is it em barrassingly bad at
what it claim s to do, but it is also exceptionally wasteful. The am ount of energy it takes to generate this garbage is baffling as it is
destructive to the environm ent. It harm s artists, it fills the internet with m eaningless clutter, and it wastes resources. If the aim  is to use this
facsim ile of creativity to put actual creative people out of work, that has a ripple effect throughout the econom y. It m akes searching and
using the internet m uch m ore difficult, discouraging use of the greatest technological achievem ent of the last thirty years. It's a stagnant
pond of polluted water, which is a m etaphor that I, a hum an being, thought up, and can unpack and explain because it actually cam e from
thoughtful analysis, not a statistical m odel of language that only superficially resem bles com m unication. Any belief in "AI" is m agical
thinking, a desire to expand it is reckless, and to do so at the expense of actual artists is insulting.
