General Comment
I do not think that the outsized usage of electricity and other resources is in any way worth the benefits of AI. Not to m ention the waste
involved in the m assive scraping operations necessary to give them  the inform ation they need to m ake their m odels.
The biggest AI com panies have m ade their datasets off the backs of Am erican workers, artists, writers, etc without fairly com pensating
them  for their work. And all of this build m odels that can't even answer questions correctly half the tim e or produce worthwhile art. 
This is a clear bubble and not som ething we should be wasting our tim e, m oney, or resources on.
