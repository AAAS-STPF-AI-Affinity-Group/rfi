General Comment
I stand against AI. It steals the hardwork of Am erican creators, refusing to give anything back from  those they take from . These people
put love, care, and hardwork into the things they create, will you really allow som e program  to steal all of that for a quick buck? What
happens when an artists own work or style becom es copyrighted and stolen from  them ? What about our writers who take m onths and
years to create a novel only to have their work used and stolen without any way to stop it? Where will we draw the line? When it steals
our very voices and puts a copyright sym bol on them ? 
Please stand against this. AI has no place to have any power over those they take from .
