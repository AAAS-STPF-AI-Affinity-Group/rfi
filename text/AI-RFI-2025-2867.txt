Please don't allow this! It is against the constitution if you allow this AI sim ps to steal art and other creative works from  talented people,
there are other ways to train AI without copyright m aterial, please for don't let these soulless AI assholes break the law and constitution,
we creatives want to thrive in the future and inspire generations to com e, so please from  the bottom  of m y heart don't allow these
com panies to use copyright and instead find other m ethods like synthetic data or som ething, just please let us creatives and talented live in
peace with our works...
