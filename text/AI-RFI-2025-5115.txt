General Comment
I am  writing to discourage the changing of copyright laws to allow AI com panies to m ine the work of any creators. AI is only able to
produce content by taking the writing, m usic, or art produced by real people and then chewing it up, rearranging it and spitting out
som ething seen as new. This is already beginning to discourage people from  sharing their work. Com panies who generate this AI content
do not create those whose work was used. This will sim ply stop people from  sharing their work as it strips people's livelihoods.
