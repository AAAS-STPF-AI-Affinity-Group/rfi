My name is Vanessa Amayo, and I am a graduating senior from Avonworth High School. I 
researched the impact of generative AI on the music industry for a semester course, and I 
recently studied this administration's viewpoint on AI regulation. Based on my tw o months of 
student research and 12 years of studying music, I think that AI regulation must be consistent 
with existing policy (such as copyright law) to protect human American creators. Tennessee’s 
Ensuring Likenes Voice and Image Security (ELVIS) Act in troduced novel legislation protecting 
artists specifically from nonconsensual AI usage, and similar policies should follow. 
Nonconsensual AI usage could be socially and financially devastating for artists, particularly 
small or independent artists without the resources to protect their work. Policy makers must hold 
AI developers and the music industry accountable to protect human artists. Music and art are 
such vital components of human culture, but performing and creating at advanced and 
professional level s can be limited by socioeconomic factors. AI -integrated platforms have the 
power to give beginner musicians access to music and enhance professionals’ capabilities. 
However, these tools must not be used as a replacement for human artists in the name of 
economic gain, for it will harm human culture and joy. As a musician and student, I believe that 
AI has the power to make both extremely positive and negative impacts, and it is the 
responsibility of the user, the developer, the government, and society as a whole to decide if we 
will leverage AI for good or let it devastate human artistry.
