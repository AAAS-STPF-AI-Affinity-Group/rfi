General Comment
Giving OpenAI im m unity towards copyright lawsuits is absolutely dystopian. This would give AI com panies, which have been widely
hated by the arts com m unity, too m uch power in this society and could lead to lots of incredibly cheap, copyright infringing, insincere
pieces of m edia that could alienate m any.
