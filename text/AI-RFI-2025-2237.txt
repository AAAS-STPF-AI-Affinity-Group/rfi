General Comment
This proposal is com pletely abusive on m any levels. Artists, businesses, and m ore will suffer because of the poor regulation around AI
training and use. Most of the m aterial AI uses is subject to copyright, and should rem ain so; this push for deregulation will m ake our nation
poorer, the internet faulty, and contribute to the brain drain already affecting us.
