Please stop the training of AI systems more powerful than gpt -4 and cooperate with other countries 
to implement a global ban. We are rapidly approaching smarter than human AI which will be 
beyond our control, eliminate the possibility of productive human e mployment and possibly 
eliminate us altogether. A global pause is needed to prevent this.
