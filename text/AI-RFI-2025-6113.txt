General Comment
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am  writing to urge you not to perm it OpenAI to steal intellectual property from  Am erican scholars and researchers. This project will
destroy m y right to m y own intellectual property and that of m y peers to the advantage of tech firm s owned by the private sector. The
em ergence of copyright protections in the 19th century was a signal advance for creative individuals. Now, by presidential fiat, this plan
seeks to overturn centuries worth of progress in protecting intellectual property. AI has no useful role to play in our society, it is a fad in
which som e tech com panies have invested quite a bit and therefore want to see it m ade lucrative. But it is not, it does nothing positive to
advance any of the stated goals, it m erely recycles what is online. Do not advance this project, it is worthless. 
Sincerely,
Liam  M. Brockey
Professor of History
Michigan State University
East Lansing, MI 48824
