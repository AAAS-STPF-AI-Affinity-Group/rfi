General Comment
I am  deeply concerned with the security of m y words and im ages online if openAI is allowed to feed copyrighted content into its
algorithm . While I do think that there are practical applications for LLMs, areas like the creative fields, or answering questions with
com posite inform ation divorced from  its context are actively regressive pursuits and should not have free reign of all data. The m aterial that
it generates is also, m ore often than not, bad and quickly becom ing hom ogeneous as generated content is also scraped from  the internet
and fed back into the algorithm . Contrary to its m isnom er, these algorithm s are not independently intelligent and provide a redundant
service that working people already provide to a greater degree of accuracy and quality.
