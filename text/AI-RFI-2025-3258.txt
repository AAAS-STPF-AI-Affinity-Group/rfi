General Comment
To, the Federal Register,
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is
overpraised and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. It m ust not be allowed to have legal standing in our country. Please, for the
sake of the people, do NOT allow it to have legal precedence in our country.
From , a concerned US Citizen.
