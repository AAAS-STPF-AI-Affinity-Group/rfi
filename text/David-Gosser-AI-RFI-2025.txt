I want my opinion known that scraping data without consent is theft. The double standard is
evident here, when an individual artist can get strung up for using someone else’s material, butif it’s an AI tool big-business, they have the right to use alllllll the data and images on thesesites without any artist consent. Hold onto your standards and don’t abuse the individuals tosupport these companies.
 
One other important note: the energy costs of these AI technologies are ASTRONOMICAL.This can’t be understated. We are already facing the issue of climate change, wars overresources, and energy crisis— and the rapid expansion of AI is making these issues muchworse, not better.
