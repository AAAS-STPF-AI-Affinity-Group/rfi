General Comment
Generative AI has no place in Am erica. It steals and exploits the work and ingenuity of the Am erican people all so that these corrupt,
im m oral pieces of m achine learning algorithm s can spit out m undane piles of plagiarist, derivative garbage. It hurts the Am erican people,
and we do not want it. 
It is a dangerously overhyped, nonsensical m ass of utter drivel that is draining resources at an alarm ing rate and it will never offer anything
to anyone. 
Generative AI is theft on a global scale. If a business cannot operate, if it cannot function without violating the Am erican people, then it
does not deserve to exist. It m ust die.
