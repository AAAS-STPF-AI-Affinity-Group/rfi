To whom it may concern:I do not believe that AI holds a place in the future of the US. It
utility is overhyped at best.
  AI systems have shown themselves to be
completely incapable of separating truth from fiction. Moreover, theseAI models are trained on stolen works for which the creators have notbeen fairly compensated.
As an artist, I do not consent for works I create to be used to program
my replacement.
  It is maddening that the current administration is even
considering allowing AI companies to steal copyrighted works with nocompensation to their creators.
  AI steals from my livelihood and
profits off of theft.   The AI companies must be stopped, and models
created with stolen data must be destroyed.
Sincerely,
Dylan M Dewenter
