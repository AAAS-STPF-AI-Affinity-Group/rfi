Last year, I did some micro task work for a large Internet company, through the website
Prolific. Over an hour, I was to look through text generated by their AI, and check it via websearch against reputable resources.
During that time, I reviewed six passages of text, reaching in length from a few sentences to
several paragraphs. My job was to mark a passage a wrong if I could find any incorrectness init. 
Of the six passages, I had to mark five as being wrong.Because of this, as well as other news about generative AI being frequently wrong, and the
many errors I have seen it make personally, I must tell you that using it for any purpose wouldbe a grave mistake, if you cared about the quality of the outcome in any way.
