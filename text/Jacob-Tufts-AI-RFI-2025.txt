Every true American should remember the story of the steel-driving folk hero John Henry.
Legend has it that his heart gave out from stress as he competed in a race against a steam drill,a race that he won at the cost of his life. Now, this story seems to be repeating itself on a grandscale. The artists are John Henry, and generative AI is the steam drill. The major differencesare as follows:
1. This is not a folktale, but an undeniable reality.
2. This is not manual labor jobs at stake, but America's artistic culture as a whole.3. The material that generative AI produces can only exist on the backs of the labors andtalents of artists nationwide. Not only that, but the material that generative AI produces iswholly inferior to any original artist's work.
The choice before Americans is clear: safeguard artists against generative AI, or risk totalcultural
 stagnation as artists are driven out of the industry by cheaply-made, AI-produced slop
regurgitated from real  artists' work. Any attempt to ensure America's "dominance" in the AI
sector must come with these safeguards. Without those safeguards against generative AI, Imust oppose this AI Action Plan.
Sincerely,
Jacob Tufts
