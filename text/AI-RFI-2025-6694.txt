General Comment
It’s absolutely nonsensical that we should allow OpenAI to scrape the internet and use copyrighted works as part of its training data. As
an author and content creator I do not consent to this. If generative AI com panies say they can’t have a business m odel without wholesale
theft of creative works then tough luck. They don’t have a business m odel. Sim ple as. I reject anything to do with OpenAI, Microsoft
copilot, Google Gem ini and any other gen AI tools wholesale.
