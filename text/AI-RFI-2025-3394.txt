General Comment
Allowing AI com panies free, unfettered use of copyrighted m aterial disenfranchises creators. If they are not able to properly credit and
com pensate those whose work they use to train their m odels, then their business should not exist. The wholesale theft of people's works is
nothing m ore than those who run these AI com panies refusing to pay their bills to grossly enrich them selves and rob those who cannot
fight back.
