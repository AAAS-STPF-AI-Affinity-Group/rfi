General Comment
Artists work HARD for our art. Art and anim ation is one of m y only reasons for living. Making art and m usic is literally what m akes
hum ans...hum an. You can literally tell the difference between art, or m usic, or m ovies, that were churned out just to m ake a profit, and art
that was m ade with real love and passion. People are flocking to indie series and m usic BECAUSE they can feel the love that was poured
into said projects, and so m uch of the industry has been overrun with em pty corporate slop. If you give gen AI free reign, it's only going to
deteriorate creative industries further, and will eventually even cause the corporate fatcats to lose m oney, because no one's going to want
to see anything m ade by AI anym ore. AI has its uses, but STEALING FROM ARTISTS AND MAKING GENERATED SLOP IS
NOT ONE OF THOSE USES.
Hands off our art!
