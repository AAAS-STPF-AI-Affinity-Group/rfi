General Comment
I do not believe AI belongs in the future of the United States. AI profits off of theft and steals from  m y livelihood and the livelihood of m y
fellow citizens. additionally AI swallows resources at an alarm ing rate for m iddling benefits. We can not ignore the environm ental costs in
carbon, training a new AI alone puts im m ense am ounts of carbon into the atm osphere and the energy and water dem ands that draw
essential resources away from  people that need them . The reality is that AI prom ises a lot, it is a powerful technology, but it is not
essential, therefore it is essential we do not invest in AI to the detrim ent of the people it is supposed to benefit. We should not allow tech
com panies to steal copyrighted m aterial with im punity, We should not allow tech com panies to funnel public resources towards their AI
projects. At every step we should be concerned with the safe and ethical im plem entations and developm ents to AI technology especially
with regards to data security, data privacy. AI technology is dam aging to the enivornm ent. AI is built on theft. AI is not reliable. AI is too
costly.
