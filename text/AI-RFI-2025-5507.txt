General Comment
This is complete horse p ucky and you all know it. These AI companies want to stea l from hard working Americans beca use they know 
their product is garbage by  itself. Tell them  to pick them sel ves up by  their bootstraps and make a real  product that people want 
and not  this AI &^% that adds noth ing to society .
