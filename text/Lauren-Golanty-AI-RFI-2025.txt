Any National AI Action Plan must engage in reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency 
as its highest priority policy action. Data centers should mitigate the carbon emissions associated 
with AI's energy consumption by transitioning to renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, and 
adopting energy -efficient practices. AI must have NET ZERO emissions, and if we are smart, NET 
POSITIVE carbon effects, to ensure a livable future for our children, who will lead the AI -ensconced 
world of tomorrow.
