General Comment
I do not believe so calledAI holds a place in the future of the US.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. I am  a videographer and m uch of what I see is blatant plagiarism  of
content with no recourse for the originator.
AI is overhyped and is not liked by the m ajority of the Am erican public, as is evidenced by the fact that com panies like Apple keep
delaying their AI features because they don't work. No use case has been shown that is not sim ply a way to not pay talented people for
their work.
