General Comment
I do not believe AI has a place in our future in Am erica, it steals from  m y and m any otherâ€™s profit and livelihoods as Am ericans and profits
greatly from  this theft. We cannot allow m ore hard working Am erican citizens to suffer because of this use of Ai. Additionally it is
overhyped and not well received by the Am erican public.
