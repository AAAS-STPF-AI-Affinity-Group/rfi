General Comment
This request is com pletely unlawful, and violates all personal copyright of every living and dead hum an being who has ever and will ever
create som ething. Those who try to justify it are asking perm ission to m ake stealing legal, and it is horrifying that it has gotten this far.
Under no circum stances should AI be allowed to train on copyrighted work. AI should not be able to steal from  every m ega corp, and
citizen like this. We live in a nightm are. Do the right thing and strike this down im m ediately.
