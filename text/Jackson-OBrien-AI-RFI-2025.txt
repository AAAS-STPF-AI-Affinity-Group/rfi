Hello
My name is Jackson O'Brien. I'm a concerned citizen writing about the "Request for
Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan"
I do not support the notion that AI models require unfettered free access to all
copyrighted  work. If OpenAI wants access to copyrighted material and the right to reproduce
it, they can pay for it; same as anyone else.  
Thank you for your time
