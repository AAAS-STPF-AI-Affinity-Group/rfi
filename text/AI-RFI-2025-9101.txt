General Comment
Machine learning m odels (aka "A.I.") is a lim ited technology that can only function with large am m ounts of data.
This proposed action plan is falsely fram ed as "rem oving legal roadblocks" to benefit our country. In reality it is an attem pt allow private
enterprises to bypass existing copyright laws to acquire the m assive am ounts of data and intellectual property to use in their m achine
learning m odels, but without the perm ission of or com pensation to the citizens and businesses who are the legal owners of that data and
intellectual property that are currently protected under existing copyright law.
In short - the A.I. com panies are on the precipice of failure and they need to steal in order to stay afloat. This is not actually a m andate to
im prove m achine learning, it is a m andate to use data without paying for it, forever.
A com pany that needs to steal in order to stay profitable is a com pany that should not exist.
I am  an artist, writer, copyright holder and US Citizen and I do not approve of this proposal.
