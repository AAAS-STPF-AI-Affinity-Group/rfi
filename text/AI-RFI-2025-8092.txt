General Comment
Absolutely not. Copyright regulations exist to protect the vital rights of creators, writers, and artists. I am  a librarian and educator who
works with youth, teaching am ong other things the ethical and legal im plications of copyright and fair use. This is legally and m orally
unacceptable, and its im plications go far beyond what the current adm inistration is ready or able to deal with.
