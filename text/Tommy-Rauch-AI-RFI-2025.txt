We should not give AI companies immunity to copyright infringement lawsuits, especially when it comes to training
data. AI is an environmental burden (intense energy requirements increase ghg emissions, the chips used requiremining of heavy metals and the environmental destruction associated with that), and is going to cause job losses andreal economic burden on working folks down the road. Just as I would not be allowed to publish copyrighted worksas my own and profit off of them, AI companies should not be allowed to pollute, damage the environment, anderode humanityâ€™s critical thinking skills to increase shareholder value.
