General Comment
Generative AI will negatively im pact the quality of everything it is put into. Everything will begin to becom e hom ogeneous and generic. As
a Graphic designer this has greatly effected m y field leading to less work opportunities in favor of cheep m eaningless products. AI will also
im pact people's creative outputs and m ake things have less m eaning. Art has always been an im portant part of expression and voicing
political grievances and the hom ogenization of AI will take the m eaningful im pact out of things. AI will also greatly im pact all work fields
with workers being replaced by artificial intelligence leading to m ass layoffs as have already been being seen all over. AI is prim arily used
by corporations to m ake a quick buck without any thought into the greater negative im pact it will have on the country. AI is dangerous and
needs to be regulated and peoples rights need to be respected. Most AI is largely trained off of illegally stolen work and should be treated
in the sam e way as any form  of theft.
