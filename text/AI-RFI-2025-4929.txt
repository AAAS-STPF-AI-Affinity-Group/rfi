General Comment
Why should AI com panies, with the backing of billions of dollars of investm ent, be allowed to take the copyrighted work of individuals
without m onetary com pensation? If consum ers have to pay m oney to watch a m ovie or read a book, then why is a com pany exem pt from
paying for the sam e content? If one business entity m ust obtain perm ission to use a work from  its copyright holder, why should an AI
com pany be exem pt? To grant them  a free perpetual license to use this inform ation is hypocritical and im m oral.
