General Comment
Artificial Intelligence cannot be used to harm  sm all businesses and the creators who are the backbone of the nation. Am erica is a country
of innovation, and this plan needs to reflect that by protecting the rights of individual creators over the rights of AI com panies to harvest
and use that data without perm ission or due com pensation.
We cannot sacrifice what m akes us special for a few dollars today.
