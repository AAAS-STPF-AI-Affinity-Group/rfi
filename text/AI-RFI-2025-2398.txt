General Comment
We need to keep our copyright and privacy protections in place. If AI has to break the law and steal in order to grow it shouldnâ€™t be
allowed to exist in the first place. Generative AI creates nothing of value. It is soulless, incredibly harm ful to the environm ent, and does
nothing but steal and give nothing back. It is an excuse to cut jobs from  hardworking hum ans and give them  to a com puter that does not
think for itself, and regularly spews out false inform ation. Do NOT give this win to Big Tech.
