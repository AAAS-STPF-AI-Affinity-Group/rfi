General Comment
Hello;
I am  writing to voice that AI should not been given access m aterial the owner doe not own via the Inform ation on the Developm ent of an
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan.
Many com panies such as Google, Apple, and Am azon already are training AI via voice, written works, or im ages, without proper
consum er consent. A m assive invasion of privacy. The m ass rejection of AI tools is not only suggested by creatives across the board, but
also the general public. If you search for program s such as Gem ini, one of the first options will be in search results, "How do I turn off(---
). And m ultiple variations of said description. 
US citizens should be able to go about their lives without feeding into m achines, especially without proper consent.
If a business that relies on others creations in order to survive, that is not a business.
It is a scam . And we should be treating it as such.
