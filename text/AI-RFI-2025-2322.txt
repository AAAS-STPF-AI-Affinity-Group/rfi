General Comment
AI has a proven track record of failure. Studies consistently show that answers it gives are often confidently wrong, and that consum ers
are LESS likely, NOT MORE, to buy a product that's advertised as having AI features. AI-generated visual art often has obvious errors
and an off-putting, noticeable digital sheen, and AI-generated m usic only exacerbates an industry where artists struggle to m ake a living,
while dragging down the quality of an ENTIRE MEDIUM of self expression. And for what? Crap. Plain and sim ple. AI-generated
content is crap. Anyone who says they like it is lying to hide an ulterior m otive.
OpenAI, the leading firm  by far in term s of AI research, has repeatedly walked back their prom ises, raised costs in a vain attem pt to
chase profitability (their costs outweigh their revenue SEVERAL TIMES OVER), and said that perfecting their m odel requires MORE
DATA THAN IS AVAILABLE.
Of course, the data they've BEEN using has been acquired without ANY REGARD for existing copyright law, establishing the precedent
that apparently, COPYRIGHT LAW CAN JUST BE IGNORED. Is that the kind of precedent we, as Am ericans, with the biggest and
best entertainm ent industry in the world, want to set? Of course not!
AI is an abject, objective failure, by any m etric, and it's tim e to accept that. The only people that want AI, are those who stand to profit
from  it.
