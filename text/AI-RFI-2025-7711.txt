General Comment
We should not allow com panies to train their AI m odels on copyrighted m aterials without authorization. If downloading m usic, film s, and
television shows without licensing them  or purchase (aka pirating) is illegal for individuals. Then why would it not be illegal for corporations
as well? They claim  fair use, but it is not fair use to copy and the redistribute the sam e intellectual property as your own.
