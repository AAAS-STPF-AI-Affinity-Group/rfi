General Comment
There is no reason to let OpenAI use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI. There is no reason to give them  special perm ission to violate
copyright and steal the intellectual property of individuals and corporations to develop a product that nobody wants. AI does not have a
place in the future of the US; it is a threat that steals jobs, m aterials, and consum es a ridiculous am ount of energy for a product that is
being shoved down the throats of custom ers never asked for it. 
If any other industry said "we need your product to develop ours, but we don't want to pay for it... can you just MAKE people give it to
us?" they'd be laughed out of the room . Doubly so if it's a product that has very little use cases other than putting actual hardworking
people out of their jobs. It's ridiculous that this is even being considered; although I'm  sure they're greasing the pockets of m any people
working for the current adm inistration for this to even be an option. Don't sell out your citizen's intellectual property for a som e extra
cam paign bucks and the vague, em pty prom ise of a product that can m aybe possibly help people one day in the far future.
