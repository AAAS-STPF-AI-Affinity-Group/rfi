Hello,
In response to requests for input from all interested parties on the Development of AI Action  
Plan.
I'm a Human Trafficking Abolitionist.
1. AI for Trafficking Detection & Prevention
Mandate AI-driven monitoring in high-risk industries: Establish guidelines
requiring the use of AI to detect trafficking patterns in hospitality, transportation, andonline platforms.
AI in supply chain audits:  Implement AI-based tracking to ensure supply chains are
free from forced labor.
2. Data Privacy & Protection for Victims
Secure AI-driven victim support tools: AI should be used to provide encrypted,anonymous resources for victims while ensuring their data privacy.
Strict AI governance on biometric data use: AI should not be used to track victims oftrafficking without clear safeguards against misuse.
3. AI in Law Enforcement & Prosecution
AI-powered forensic tools: Use AI for digital forensics to analyze traffickers’communication patterns and evidence across multiple jurisdictions.
Improve AI explainability for legal cases:  Ensure AI-generated insights are legally
admissible and interpretable for court proceedings.
4. AI and the Dark Web
AI-driven dark web surveillance: Strengthen AI capabilities in tracking humantrafficking activity within encrypted and hidden online spaces.
Regulate AI-powered anonymization tools: Enforce stricter controls on AIapplications that allow traffickers to evade detection.
5. Ethical AI Development & Deployment
Ban AI tools that enable exploitation: Prohibit AI-generated content (deepfakes,
chatbots, etc.) from being used in exploitative ways, such as generating child sexual


abuse materials.
Regulate AI-driven recruitment platforms:  Ensure AI used in hiring doesn’t
inadvertently facilitate labor trafficking.
Kind regards,
Sabrina Stratford
