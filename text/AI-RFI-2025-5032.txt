General Comment
I am  an em ployee of a m ulti-billion dollar entertainm ent com pany. As with m any sim ilar com panies, IP and copyrighted m aterials are core
to the continued growth and success of the com pany. If other com panies and organizations were able to now freely train AI m odels on
our proprietary content and data, it would undercut the growth and success of both m y em ployer and countless other US businesses,
devastating entire industries. AI is a m ajor scientific and technological breakthrough that Am erica m ust leverage to rem ain at the forefront
of technological innovation. However, we m ust be cautious to not cause irreparable dam age in the process. I strongly advise against
weakening and dism antling copyright and IP protections in this process. While such action would likely yield short-term  gains for AI, the
cost to other industries would be far too great. To ensure strong Am erican econom ic growth and jobs for Am erican citizens, we m ust find
a different path towards growing our developm ent of Artificial Intelligence.
