General Comment
As a working artist, AI steals and profits off of m y labor without consent from  or com pensation to m e. AI is built off the backs of
hardworking Am ericans without having to pay them  a dim e for their efforts. Furtherm ore, it discourages people from  thinking, learning,
creating, and writing on their own. It is a tool to atrophy the creativity, intelligence, and innovation of Am ericans m inds by discouraging
people from  exercising their own ability to think and create. It has no place in Am erica, and serves no one but the ultra wealthy seeking to
devalue the labor and skills of the average person without needing to com pensate or even credit them  for their efforts. AI can only do
harm .
