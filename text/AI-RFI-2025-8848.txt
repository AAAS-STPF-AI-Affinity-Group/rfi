General Comment
Allowing OpenAI to train on copyrighted content without perm ission devalues the work of corporations, creatives, and, studios who rely
on licensing and ownership for their livelihoods and continued creation. As it stands they exploit artists, dilute future originality, and
underm ine industries that depend on intellectual property protections. The technology still rem ains unprofitable and has done largely
nothing except dam age the reputation of com panies to their consum er bases. If AI com panies can freely scrape and m onetize copyrighted
work, it sets a dangerous precedent where any property a com pany owns is a target to use, abuse, and dilute with a soulless copy of to
the point where all product loses any sense of value.
