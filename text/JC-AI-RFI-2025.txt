J.C., no email  
I think we should prioritize: Not letting AI models and the servers they run on take up too 
much energy Consumer protection so Americans aren't forced to deal with this stuff if they don't want to (ex: easy option to decline use on my laptop) Respect to copyright so artists don't get ripped off Respect to privacy so the AI isn't trained on personal data Labor 
protections so companies don't try to replace American workers with AI 'agents' that 
cannot perform as well as people
