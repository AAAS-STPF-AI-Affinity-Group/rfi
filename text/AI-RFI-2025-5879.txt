General Comment
Generative "AI" and "LLM" that build, or train, on copyright protected m aterial is theft. If a com pany cannot function without com m itting
illegal activity, it is not an actual com pany, it is in actuality highway robbery. It is against m oral fiber to purposely create an enterprise
whose sole purpose is to pilfer another person's work. I will vote against any governm ental representative who allows any com pany to
continue in any such corrupt business practice.
