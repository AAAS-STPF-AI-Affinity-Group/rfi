General Comment
While AI does have its benefits in certain departm ents it can also be very devastating. Sm all com panies like artists and indie m usic
com posers will all suffer from  the use of generative AI. Even voice actors for anim ated m ovies and shows will also suffer job losses from
the use of generative AI. In the grand schem e of things m ore harm  will be done than good if AI is perm itted to m ake stuff like art, m usic,
and play voices. Another issue AI has is that people m ay get too used to using AI and stop thinking critically. This can harm  even
professional businesses, doctors, teachers, and the general public. The use of AI should be lim ited if not com pletely disregarded. Laws
should also be put in place that m ake it illegal for users and AI to use voices, m usic, art, or any other form  of copyrighted or personal
invasion as it could lead to consequences for the person who created such m edia or has said voice. Afterall, we don't want people using
the voice of, lets say, a high ranking governm ent official to send bad m essages across the globe which m ay cause harm  to the reputation of
the country. This should be the sam e treatm ent for everyone as well.
