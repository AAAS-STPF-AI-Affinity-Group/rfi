General Comment
I am  an educated wom an, a teacher, and I consider m yself well-read on the subject of LLMs and generative AI--I am  also friends with a
num ber of artists. As a result, I oppose any AI-friendly legislation, m em oranda, or executive orders. Generative AI com panies such as
OpenAI has adm itted that they cannot be profitable without stealing from  real artists, and this cannot be borne. These program s that
allegedly produce art and other things m erely hallucinate as you feed them  stolen m aterial and an absurd am ount of precious resources. It's
a technological dead-end. Do not hum or it any longer.
Sincerely,
Clarity Morrison
