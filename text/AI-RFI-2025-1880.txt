General Comment
The Artificial Intelligence Action Plan is a horrid idea that does nothing m ore than steal from  creatives both across m any big industries and
sm all businesses. From  Hollywood to Indie Creators, to allow AI to take from  copyrighted m aterial would be to steal the property and
creations of others on a m assive scale; TV shows, m ovies, book authors, etc. Both these businesses, big and sm all, would suffer severely
from  this action plan and by extension, the lives of those who work in these businesses. By the extent of the dam age it would do to
people's livelihoods alone, it is unethical and irresponsible. Generative AI has also proven to be environm entally destructive. The resources
required to run it has shown to be highly inefficient. So not only would this be econom ically unwise, it would be ecologically devastating. It
is not worth the cost on both hum an and ecological life.
