General Comment
A policy that allows m onopolistic com panies like Google and OpenAI to scrape, sum m arize, and regurgitate copyrighted content created
by others is the effective death of copyright and creative invention in this country. Am erica has been the world's creative heart for over a
hundred years, and this would be the end of it.
