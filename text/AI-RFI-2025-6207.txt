General Comment
We need m ore stringent regulation on generative AI com panies, not to let them  do whatever they please. Many of these com panies are
taking in vast swathes of data from  people without consent or recom pense, and the governm ent should be holding them  accountable rather
than encouraging them . Artists deserve to be be paid and recognized for their work, not have it ingested and regurgitated by a corporate
m odel that will still output a fundam entally inferior product.
