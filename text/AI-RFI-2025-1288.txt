General Comment
Artificial intelligence is not som ething that the Am erican governm ent should be prioritizing. There is already plenty of evidence that the
continued im plem entation of artificial intelligence in generative data, data collection, and data algorithm s in consum er-facing platform s
exactly counters the goal of "continued U.S. AI leadership will prom ote hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness, and national
security". There have been several security and data breaches, tem porary job losses, and power grid concerns related to generative AI
(genAI), not to m ention the fact that it can be easily m anipulated into m isinform ation. Am erican dom inance in technology is unparalleled,
and we should set an exam ple in excellence by not falling for the newest buzzword from  Silicone Valley.
