General Comment
I used to work for a licensing agency. Under currently copyright law, in order to use an im age, the rights holder of that im age m ust be
com pensated. This use can be as brief as showing the im age on screen for a docum entary, or as extensive as creating varied m erchandise.
But unless the im age is in public dom ain or within fair use boundaries, it is NOT free to use. It MUST be paid for. AI m akers have
scraped m illions of copyrighted works to feed into their m odels. This is a blatant violation of copyright and m ust not stand. There is no
reason why AI program m ers should get to ignore current copyright law and regulations when they stand to 
profit enorm ously from  the software these stolen works are based on. 
Copyright law exists to encourage innovation by allowing creators to be fairly com pensated for their intellectual property. Making an
exception for AI training m odels will stifle innovation, not prom ote it.
