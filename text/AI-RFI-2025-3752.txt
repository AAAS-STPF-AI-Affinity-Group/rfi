General Comment
I do not believe Generative AI has a future in the United States of Am erica. If anything we should be com bating its continued and lax use
since it has incredible potential to m islead and confuse the public as to what is true.
Voices, im ages and written words m ay be forged by those with nefarious intent to underm ine professionals and elected officials by forces
both foreign and dom estic if this tool continues to be utilized.
While it serves us well in sifting through m ountains of data, sealing holes in digital security and increasing the accuracy of m edical
diagnostics, it should be relegated to those specific fields and even then, heavily scrutinized by hum an experts as all things should be. It has
no other place in this country and anyone who vouches for such dubious uses in the nam e of "national security" should be suspect.
