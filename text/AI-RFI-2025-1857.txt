General Comment
I am  an independent artist, and generative AI is infringes on m ine and m any other artist's and writer's copyrighted work. 
My copyright, m y choice. AI and other com panies do not have the right to m y creative works, art, and writing, and they do not have
consent to train their AI m odels on these works. They have not purchased a license for m y work, nor anyone else's work, to be used to
train AI and they don't intend to. They have no right to use m y work any other person's creative work, or even personal selfies, but they
have gotten away with it to this point due to the lack of regulations on this new technology. 
The "unnecessary burdens" are protections of copyright and the creator's work. If m y rights are a burden, then this is an unethical and
unsustainable business. Any business whose m odel relies on infringing on m illions of people's rights is not ethical.
Creative and intellectual property theft is just one of the m any unethical parts of generative AI. If you truly want to be the lead in AI
developm ent do it ethically or don't do it at all. Tech com panies are not who the governm ent was created to protect and prioritizing their
needs over the populace is absolutely a disgusting overreach. This is corruption.
AI com panies have shown a flagrant disregard for the individuals they stole creative works from  to train their AI. This is not som ething
people should stand for nor sit idly by and encourage. 
I do not consent to m y copyrighted work being used to train AI in any way shape or form .
