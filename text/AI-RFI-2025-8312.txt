General Comment
I do no believe AI has any m oral or ethical m eans of supporting itself, and I do not believe a case has been m ade for what practical use it
could have that m erits the destruction of so m uch hum an cultural production. It is a narrow-m inded technology that only concerns itself
with speculation that builds on top of theft and abuse of power. So m uch harm  has been done, and will be done, if OpenAI is allowed to
run ram pant. Please do not give one corporate entity the ability to claim  ownership over the digital existence of all of hum anity.
