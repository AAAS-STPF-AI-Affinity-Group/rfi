General Comment
Under no conditions should the governm ent enable OpenAI and other such entities to be im m une to copyright infringem ent lawsuits under
any reason. This is a gross violation of every single persons liberty and right to what they create, and will have devastating effects for the
entire world should these corporations be allowed to steal without recourse. I beg you to consider the truth and not just the buzzwords
you're being fed.
