General Comment
As a voter, the idea that corporations should be given the ability to harvest data for the purpose of constructing AI m odels without consent
and with no legal recourse is frankly disturbing.
AI has potential, but these works are not transform ative, and have already been shown to be able to steal the content of hum an artists. No
corporation should be able to take the copyrighted m aterial of another citizen or corporation for the purposes of profiting from  it through
the training of an AI database without consent or com pensation to the artist.
