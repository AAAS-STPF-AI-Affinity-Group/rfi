General Comment
I am  a voice over artist who has had their work directly im pact by these AI com panies cloning professional actors without their perm ission
and m aking m oney that should rightfully go to individuals because there are zero laws or regulations that prevent them  from  doing so. If
these AI com panies cannot function without stealing and learning from  data, then they should cease to exist.
