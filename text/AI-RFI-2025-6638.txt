General Comment
Allowing com panies like Google and OpenAI to freely scrape and use any m aterial they wish to train their AI is tantam ount to theft. If the
United States governm ent they will be com plicit in this theft. It has been shown that an AI can not replicate im agery that it has received no
exam ples of, to the extent that they cannot generate an im age of a watch at with different hand positions. Any im age it generates relies on
the m aterial it takes as input. It cannot create anything new, it is sim ply an advanced collage generator. Because of this reliance any
com pany, or anyone training an AI, should be m ade to pay for the m aterials they train on.
