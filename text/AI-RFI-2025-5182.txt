General Comment
AI is absolutely not the future and honestly is a terrible investm ent in its current state. For all the concern about governm ent spending
waste we absolutely should not waste any m ore m oney on AI that could be going back to working US citizens. Giving AI potential free
rein on once copyrighted m aterial is a waste and terrible idea. AI does not create, it steals and is full of errors. When a CEO of an AI
com pany adm its that AI can’t survive without the use of copyrighted m aterials, things already m ade and protected it suggests a glaring
issue that shouldn’t be overlooked and som ething that shouldn’t be encouraged by giving it m ore leeway. There’s a real potential for harm
by not lim iting AI until the technology is proven to be able to handle at least som e of the expectations m istakenly placed on it.
