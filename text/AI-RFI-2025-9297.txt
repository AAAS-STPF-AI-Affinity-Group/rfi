General Comment
Do not allow AI to steal copyrighted works - it will hurt creatives in every field, and disincentivize anyone from  creating or sharing their
own work. The effects that it would have on both the ability for one to m ake a viable living on their work, as well as on culture and society
as a whole, would be devastating.
