General Comment
I am  an artist-drawing, designing, and creating is m y literal livelihood and how I m ake m y living. I have not spent well over a decade of m y
life honing m y craft only for MY personal copywrite to be violated without m y consent and m y work stolen and used to train generative
program s that will replace m y job. This is absolutely despicable and un-am erican to violate m y privacy, m y creations, and m y work like
this. In Am erican, when som ething is created we are supposed to autom atically have copyright to our creations-that's how so m any great
Am ericans have becom e innovators and respected creators known throughout the world-because we knew we could create and our
creations would be OURS. 
If you want m ore great Am ericans standing on the world stage as innovators support THEM, not the m achines that steal from  their labor.
Do better, or lose what m ade this nation great in the first place.
