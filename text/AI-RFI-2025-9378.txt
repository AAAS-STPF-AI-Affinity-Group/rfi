General Comment
AI does not belong in a facet of the US where hum ans do. A m ore speedy answer does not equate to a better life. AI uses theft to attain
profit, robbing from  the lives of US citizens. This will be a com plete m isuse of technological advancem ent, only to result in a
deconstruction of a living, breathing society. 
Do not allow this.
