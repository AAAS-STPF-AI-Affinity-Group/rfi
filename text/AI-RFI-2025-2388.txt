General Comment
AI is an insult to creatives everywhere, and by extension an insult to regularly folks whose own personal data and pictures are being used
to train these m achines. AI is nothing m ore than a short cut and not even a good one, it was created with the wrong ideas in m ind and
allowing AI to continue to exist in the way it currently does will leave a precedent for copyright infringem ent to be the norm , without being
able to enforce it, costing people and com panies a large am ount of m oney, affecting their profits harshly.
