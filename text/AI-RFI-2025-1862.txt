General Comment
As a creator who has had great issue with copyright violation of m y m aterial, I am  concerned that tech com panies are using the work of
others to train their program s to m ake sim ilar content.
AI m odels are m achines being trained on copyrighted m aterial without perm ission. This practice underm ines the rights of creators and
gives these tech com panies a right to profit off off the work of hard work of others.
AI com panies should seek licenses to use copyrighted m aterial for training purposes.
AI com panies should disclose the sources of their training data and how they ensure copyright com pliance.
Copyright holders should have the right to sue AI com panies for infringem ent.
AI developers should prioritize ethical considerations and respect copyright laws.
Hum an thought, voice, and creative output is the basis of our entire civilization. Allowing a handful of tech com panies to take every aspect
of an individualâ€™s creative work and rem ix it for their own profit is a terrifying prospect.
