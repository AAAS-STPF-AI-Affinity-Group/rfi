General Comment
Not only do I feel like AI prom otes theft of existing knowledge and art, particularly generative AI, but it will also actively put Am ericans
out of jobs and deny opportunities for m any people affiliated with the arts and STEM fields, two things Am erica has always had gigantic
leaps and bounds in com pared to the rest of the developed world, replacing them  with otherwise subpar algorithm -driven facsim iles that
are prone to disinform ation and m anipulation.
