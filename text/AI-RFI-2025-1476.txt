Quality Plus Engineering AI RFI Reponse


1 
To:  National Science Foundation 
From:  Quality Plus Engineering (Q+E) 
Subject:  Request for Information on the Development of an Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan Date:  March 15, 2025 
This letter serves as our formal response to the National Science Foundation Request 
for Information on the Development of an Artiﬁcial Intelligence Action Plan issued on 
February 6, 2025.  
To address the following actions, the U.S. must prioritize leadership in AI while 
balancing innovation with responsible governance, using current risk frameworks, and 
global best practices.  We suggest the following policy actions focusing on the risk 
assurance of AI models: 
•Enhance AI readiness in national defense:  Integrate AI assurance intointelligence, logistics, and cyber operations prioritizing explainable models forbattleﬁeld decision-making.
•Implement a risk-tiered regulatory approach:  Develop a risk-tieredregulatory categorization model applying stricter oversight to AI systems incritical infrastructure and law enforcement.
•Mandate sector-speciﬁc AI explainability standards:  Require post-hocexplanation techniques for high-risk AI applications in critical infrastructure,healthcare, ﬁnance, and national security to ensure stakeholders understand AI
decision-making processes.
•Develop sector-speciﬁc risk assurance frameworks:  Create a Federal AI
Assurance task force to oversee critical AI lifecycle audits including veriﬁcationand validation.

•Develop professional credentials for AI auditors:  Develop professional
licensing such as Professional Engineering for conducting risk assurance auditsof critical AI systems.
•Expand the NIST Risk Management Framework:  Include privacy,cybersecurity, and AI safety under integrated Enterprise Risk Management(ERM) model.
