General Comment
Protect artists and hum an creators works from  being appropriated for the profit of one com pany. The sam e wouldn’t work in reverse
where artists can appropriate the work of OpenAI for their own to do with what they want. That’s prohibited by the term s of service. So,
if the law is balanced and fair, ie justice is blind, then both artists and OpenAI should have equal standing as it relates to protections for
their work. That should be a fundam ental value.
