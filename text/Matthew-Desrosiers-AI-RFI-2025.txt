ALCON,
Expanding the access of companies to scraped the data of copyrighted works is blatant theft. It
does not address the core issue of inaccessability of information, and it favors one industryover the rule of law, which is a blatantly un-American sentiment that should give anylawmakers shivers.
My proposed solution to the suggested problem is this:Reduce the amount of time copyright is in effect to no less than 20 years.
 
At this point, the material would enter the public domain, and would allow unfettered access
to the data. The creators would have ample time to profit from their creations, and the AIindustry would gain a wealth of new materials to train their models on overnight.
We should be proud to be able to respect the rule of law and our creators. You do not retain
talent by exploiting it. You retain talent by respecting it. This is a fast road to talent lossthrough emigration. This has been seen in the Soviet Union and Russia's "brain drain", and wecan prevent such losses by treating our artists with dignity and respect.
We can be better than this.This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-
