General Comment
As a writer, using m y work to train AI is theft. My work is copyrighted which m eans no part of it can be reused without consent. AI is
basically a sophisticated copy and paste program  using bits of m y work and bits of other copyrighted work. Theft on a grand scale. The
governm ent should not approve this.
