General Comment
Hey, m y nam e is Natalie Meng, and I am  a 2nd-sem ester senior at Avonworth High School. I studied generative AI and its im pact on
epidem iology and healthcare for two m onths in a course on AI and Ethics this year. For m y research, I think this current adm inistration's
viewpoint on AI regulation is good for our countryâ€™s advancem ent and global dom inance; however, it com es with risks. Based on m y
research, I have found that Artificial Intelligence has begun its im pact and has m uch m ore potential to change our healthcare and m edicine
system . AI is an extensive tool that can speed up the analysis of m edical im aging, take care of adm inistrative tasks, and reduce the
workload of healthcare units that are already understaffed. Patients will be able to receive faster and m ore accurate diagnoses. Without
barriers, AI can also further advance preventative healthcare. AI assists the developm ent of vaccines and drugs, which is originally tim e-
consum ing and expensive. Rem oving barriers to AI can allow for m ore free developm ent and efficient use by com petitive businesses,
healthcare units, and individuals. While Executive Order 14179 has created an opening for AI's advancem ent, I think we should keep in
m ind that by rem oving governm ent control and regulation on generative AI, its use becom es m ore vulnerable to com m on concerns with it,
like deepfakes.
