General Comment
Moving to allow all content, regardless of copyright, to be fed to generative AI m odels is a horrific m ove that destroys the lives of m any
people who create the item s being offered to the generative AI. Destroying copyright laws just to feed generative AI will only bring harm ,
and is no m ore than legalized theft of intellectual property. Such a m ove is sham eful. Creatives and businesses have been struggling against
having their works stolen for generative AI, and having these changes go into effect will be devastating, strippinf away ownership of
anything they took tim e to create. Being unable to post creations online for fear of data being scraped and having no recourse will destroy
m any creatives' livelihoods, as m any creatives depend upon selling creations online to earn m oney.
Generative AI has no place in this area. Do not allow it in.
