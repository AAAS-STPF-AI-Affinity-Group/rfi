General Comment
As of right now, AI has been trained on stolen creative work, including but not lim ited to: visual art, literature, and individual social m edia
posts. Copyright law is settled law, and, as a writer, it sets a deeply concerning precedent that OpenAI or Google would be allowed to
use m y writing to further refine their AI. Due to these ethical concerns, m any consum ers have also rejected AI-based products, which
creates doubt about how useful AI will be to US com m erce and prosperity. 
Additionally, I disagree with the opinion that AI would be beneficial for national security. If you cannot even trust AI web search results to
have factually correct inform ation that serves the user's aim s, how will it be of use for national security reasons?
