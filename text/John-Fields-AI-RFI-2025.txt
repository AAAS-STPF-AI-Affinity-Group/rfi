I'm an Assistant Professor at a small private school, Concordia University Wisconsin. I received 
a National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) grant in October 2024 for my 
work in privacy preserving machine learning with education data. We w ere one of the non -R1 
universities to receive a grant and this helped small institutions to do research that has typically 
only been available to R1 universities. We also partnered with the company OpenMined who is a 
small startup that was able to particip ate in an area typically dominated by the big tech 
companies. I hope that the US government will consider fully funding the NAIRR beyond the 
pilot stage to put us on a path to more democratized access to AI which allows more researchers 
to help advance the  US capabilities in this area.
