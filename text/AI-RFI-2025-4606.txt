General Comment
As an artist m yself, I do not think generative AI should be given special exception to use copyrighted works. This would basically destroy
independent artists and be a huge blow to creativity as a whole as corporations would no doubt exploit this legal loophole to elim inate
hum an artists from  industry all together. It is already hard enough as it is for creative professionals without m achines ready replacing us,
especially ones that only can learn from  hum an artists to begin with. Until actual regulation and oversight can be im plem ented on this new
technology then it cannot be allowed to grow without check. This will only lead to it hurting the econom y and m assive lost of talented
workers.
