General Comment
Unlicensed use of copyrighted m aterials in order to produce products that com pete with that m aterial is an affront to the very existence of
copyright law. Granting AI com panies unrestricted use of copyrighted m aterials is a threat to all independent creative work. Were the use
of copyrighted m aterials for training AI m odels to be considerer fair use, no person or corporate entity would ever be able to release their
work to the public without fear that it would be im m ediately consum ed by AI com panies and used to produce endless variations of that
work. Any work that becam e publicly observable would im m ediately becom e a com m odity whose availability was controlled not by its
creator, but com panies whose m odels was trained on the work.
