General Comment
Allowing AI to use the works of other is theft. There is no other word for it. This is anti-com petitive business behavior by Big Tech to take
ownership of data without perm ission from  the owner.
It is im portant to protect the copyrights belonging to citizens, and not let AI steal them  to train them  how to copy that owner.
Google, for exam ple. uses AI to censor speech it does not like. It does not need be offensive. It is im portant, now m ore than ever, to
protect sm all businesses and content creators by continuing to enforce our copyright laws.
