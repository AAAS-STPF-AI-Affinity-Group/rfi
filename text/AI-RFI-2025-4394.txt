General Comment
From  what Iâ€™ve seen, AI sim ply m akes inferior product com pared to what hum ans can do. It m akes terrible art, and m akes terrible
decisions after being trained off of the hard work of real hum ans. 
I have not seen or heard anybody in real life wishing for this m uch AI to be im plem ented in every occupation that it is being developed for,
as it takes away jobs from  real hum ans. There is sim ply no place for it in our lives. These com panies that are trying so hard to force AI
into our lives should m ake som ething m ore productive that benefits hard-working people m ore than AI that steals from  people.
