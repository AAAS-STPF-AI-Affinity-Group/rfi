Hello,
It is my humble opinion in the AI matter that it be used immediately for the safe guarding of payments made to
disaster applicants.I am a reservist in the EHP cadre of FEMA and I recognize the immediate need for the streamlining of application todedication of valuable federal funds. It is of great importance that this issue is addressed as Iâ€™ve seen this issue notbeing resolved. I am a Biologist when not deployed but would explain further this idea if asked.
