General Comment
The unregulated scraping of works of art to train AI system s raises significant ethical and m oral concerns, particularly regarding the rights
and livelihoods of the artists who created these works. Artists pour their tim e, creativity, and passion into their creations, often relying on
their work for incom e and professional recognition. When their art is scraped without consent or com pensation, it underm ines their
autonom y and devalues their labor. This practice essentially treats their work as a free resource for corporate profit, disregarding the fact
that these creations are the intellectual property of individuals who deserve to have a say in how their work is used.
You should also think about this: the lack of regulation in this area creates a power im balance between artists and large tech com panies.
Many artists, especially independent or em erging ones, lack the resources or legal support to challenge the unauthorized use of their work.
This exploitation perpetuates a system  where corporations benefit from  the creative labor of individuals without contributing to the
sustainability of the artistic com m unity. By failing to establish clear guidelines or com pensation m echanism s, we risk eroding trust in the
relationship between technology and the arts, potentially stifling creativity and discouraging artists from  sharing their work publicly.
This unregulated use of art to train AI system s you're aim ing for also raises broader questions about the ethical developm ent of
technology. AI has the potential to revolutionize m any fields, but its progress should not com e at the expense of fairness and respect for
hum an creativity. If the foundation of AI is built on the uncom pensated labor of artists, it sets a troubling precedent for how we value
hum an contributions in the digital age. Regulating the use of artistic works in AI training is not just about protecting individual rights—it’s
about ensuring that technological advancem ent aligns with principles of equity and respect for all form s of hum an expression.
