General Comment
In a country where labour equals pay, it is both unwise and unfair for anyone and anything to be able to steal the work of others unasked
and unpaid. It is unnecessary to our growth of our country and will cost m oney that we do not have.
There is no worth in com m itting to this end of tech. It would not help the Am erican people. If anything this is a cash grab by a sector of
our country that regularly layoffs workers to m atch the unm et prom ises to their investors.
There is no proof provided that this will do anything, but harm  the public and the trade in our country will even m ore be burdened by the
thievery of those who already have so m uch.
I love science and m ath. 
I im agine such tech wonders our future could hold, but it doesn’t start with com panies who chase wealth for wealth’s sake, nor does it
start on the backs of the already overworked working class, or with com panies already falling into the hole as they lay off workers who
are necessary to the stability of the infrastructure within those com panies and outside of.
Do not allow this to m ove forward if you value our country and its people.
