General Comment
As currently im plem ented, generative artifical intelligence (gAI) developm ent is characterized by the outright theft of data scraped from  the
internet without the express perm ission of the owners of that data, which has been the subject of m uch scrutiny and criticism . Further, the
labor landscape is increasingly bleak in tech sectors both in the United States and abroad. As a particularly salient exam ple, workers in
visual effects are increasingly being laid off as com panies opt for gAI-based solutions â€“ which, in a twist of irony, only exist because they
have been trained on the very im ages produced by these workers without their consent. gAI therefore presents m ajor intellectual property
and labor concerns, am ong others. It is of the utm ost im portance that the guidelines establish and enshrine protections so that gAI does
not continue to adversely affect individuals and sm all businesses.
