General Comment
AI needs to be litigated with the sam e am ount of scrutiny and severity as piracy or copyright. Hum anity's creativity and ability to convey
hum an em otion to one another is being threatened, the creative industries decades of effort is being stolen and m illed up into digital
garbage that conveys nothing and creatively bankrupt. Without an action plan to heavily safeguard the efforts of the creative industry as a
whole, corportions will exploit and befoul the freedom  and ingenuity that this country used to stand for.
