General Comment
While I am  not an artist, I am  surrounded by those who are, and rely on their hard-earned skills to support them selves. Som e barely do,
while som e can't without being reliant on others, such as their spouses or fam ily.
AI threatens them  daily by taking potential patrons and custom ers away, on top of flooding our search engines (especially on google
im ages) with useless AI slop that m akes it absurdly difficult to find the truth of an issue. Neverm ind the AI slop that appears in various
cheap ads for the world's latest crypto rug pull.
I believe that learning m odels and the people who host them  m ust at the least give com pensation to the people who m ake the work they
use to feed their learning processes, and only if they consent- keyword, CONSENT- to their work being used to do so. Else, their
m odels are inherently plagiarizing on real, living people who m ake art.
