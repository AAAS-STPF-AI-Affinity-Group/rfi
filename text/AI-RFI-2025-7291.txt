General Comment
Generative AI is a threat to Am erican jobs and Am erican safety, and allowing OpenAI to do what it wants would have severe
repercussions on all our lives. This includes the potential for deepfakes of Trum p, Musk, and other governm ent figures. GenAI m odels are
also known to have accessed and learned from  HIPAA protected docum ents and CSEM, and thus can generate from  that inform ation.
Do not give OpenAI a pass.
