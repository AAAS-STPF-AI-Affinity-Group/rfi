General Comment
the largest part of the artificial intelligence debate is where is it being used. if it's being used as a part of a specific closed system  (for
instance in a software to m ake engineering physical parts easier) it works well. 
But for instances where it's just scraping data to regurgitate an answer and rem ove any basis for hum an thought (where it's being forced
into these search applications and social networks) it has kind of been a scourge on hum anity. it's not really helping anyone when it's
rem oving the need to critically think for oneself. Until the system s them selves can fact check, cross-reference, and weed out the false,
m isleading, and satirical inform ation from  the data set it parses, they will continue to be a danger to society. Too frequently these system s
propagate false and m isleading inform ation that get published to social m edias and dissem inated by well m eaning, but m isinform ed,
individuals as 'fact'.
Without proper safeguards we risk the further dissem ination of untruths. We risk that technology being used by bad actors against the
country and the dem ocracy we dearly love.
