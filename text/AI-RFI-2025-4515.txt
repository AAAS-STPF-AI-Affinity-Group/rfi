General Comment
Personal inform ation should not be allowed to train AI. Everyone should autom atically be exem pt from  having their inform ation used with
AI. The option should be that they opt in if they want to participate.
It should also be prohibited in work spaces and the arts. Am ericans shouldn't have their jobs replaced by AI.
AI doesn't benefit anyone other than it's creators and business owners.
