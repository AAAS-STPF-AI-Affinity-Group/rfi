General Comment
I firm ly believe as an Am erican citizen that AI generation as it currently stands is detrim ental to the public. AI should not do the heavy
lifting that takes away our personal growth. AI should be enhancing our decisions like a tool should, instead of giving us an out to pass off
responsibility and effort. Unethically sourced AI is also unsettling in ways that underm ine craftsm anship in digital m atters. Who can use the
full benefits of AI generation is also a troubling m atter as it has m asssive potential for m isuse as its life-like quality continues to increase,
there are worries such as generating alternate history or falsified evidence/ defam ation or use in scam s.
