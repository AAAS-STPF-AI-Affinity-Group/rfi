Hello,My name is Lynn Le and I am against
 Executive Order 14179. As a creative, there is no benefit to use AI.
I don't find what's good about it when it's stealing from creatives and uses a lot of resources to
create  regurgitate unoriginal ideas.
What this does is create an environment where companies will happily fire creatives and replace themwith AI if it means to save "money." Because of this, it's poisoning the environment, leaving thousands ofcreatives without jobs. Fellow colleague have expressed they've been without an animation job for over3+ years.
  What can we do to help this situation and create a sustainable and thriving place?
The people want that human element when they engage in any creative medium. There is such abacklash against AI and people in power are not listening to us.
Please reconsider this as this will be hurting everyone.Thank you,
Lynn
