General Comment
These AI com panies are attem pting to cover for their incom petence and failure to deliver anything resem bling what was prom ised by
shifting the blam e to 'burdensom e regulations'. 
We cannot sacrifice the United States creativity econom ic m arket, which relies heavily on robust copyright protections, for these snake oil
salesm en. If these people had any ability to deliver on what they say, they would have done so by now, given their blatant flaunting of
already-existing law.
They cannot be worth tearing up decades of copyright law. Im agine, Donald, if they train their AI on old episodes of The Apprentice?
Who then will pay you royalties?
