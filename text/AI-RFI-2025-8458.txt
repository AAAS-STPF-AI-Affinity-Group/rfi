General Comment
As an artist from  Europe. I strongly believe Generative AI is harm ful to creators and society in general in m any ways. It has also proven to
be deeply unsustainable, cost-inefficient and productivity-reducing for com panies, who will see their efficiency and consum er interaction
drop due to insistent on that technology. General public does not want it in their lives.
Aside from  that however, m y im portant question is: why would Am erican com panies be allowed to break m y international rights?
