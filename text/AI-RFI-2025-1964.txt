General Comment
I am  a good blogger that has been creating and posting recipes since 2017. As a sm all business, I rely on traffic to m y website to earn a
living. With the introduction of AI in search results, I have seen a negative im pact in the search volum e com ing to m y site. I believe it is
unfair for Google and Open AI to use m y content to train its LLMs, and the show those results in search ahead of m y own, original
content. If this continues, m any sm all bloggers will be forced to shut down, lim iting the creative output by m any, and ultim ately hurting not
only sm all businesses but stifling creativity and output. Please consider this, and do not let Google and Open AI m onopolize the internet.
