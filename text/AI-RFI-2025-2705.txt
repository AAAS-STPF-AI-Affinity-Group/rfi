General Comment
AI is a genuinely useful technology in the right circum stances. But right now, it is so under regulated that I personally believe it should stay
out of the public dom ain until we can properly protect people's creative spaces without the risk of infringing on their products and stories.
As of now, I have only seen division from  the controversial actions taken with this new technology. Citizens should have their own right to
do what they want with the technology that is m ade public. But that should only be okay if it doesn't bring harm  to those around them . It's
clear to m e that AI has m ade the lives of creatives m ore difficult as people in art or writing careers (and m any others) have had the risk of
losing their jobs due to the lack of protection against AI.
