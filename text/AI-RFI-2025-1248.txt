General Comment
Generative LLM technology should not be trained on copyrighted data with perm ission and fair paym ent. It should not be used without
hum an supervision and fact-checking because it does not have hum an judgm ent or experience and regularly produces errors and
com pletely fabricated inform ation that can be hazardous to hum an health and safety. The environm ental costs of generative LLM training
and use m ust be m itigated with com pletely clean energy and im provem ents in cooling technology that don't waste m illions of gallons of
water that hum ans need to survive. All generative LLM technology should be strictly regulated to ensure that it is not trained on stolen data
or CSAM m aterial, that it is not used unethically or to replace necessary hum an labor and creativity, and that it does not cause further
dam age to our fragile clim ate.
