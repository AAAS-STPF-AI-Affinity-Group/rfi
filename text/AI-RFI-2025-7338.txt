General Comment
Generative AI is theft, is a scam , and does not deserve special exem ptions from  the law. I absolutely hate AI and do not support it AT
ALL. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US, at all. Plus, AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of
theft. Furtherm ore, AI is overhyped and unnecessary. Do not do this.
