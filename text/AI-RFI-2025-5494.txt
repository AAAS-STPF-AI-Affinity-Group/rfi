General Comment
It is m y personal belief that giving AI com panies the run of the entirety of all m edia and copyright for "training" (plagiarism  and theft) will
not only ruin the econom y further, but also take away so m any jobs for artists, writers, actors, and m any other creative professions. Please
consider this, as artists and creatives are already struggling so m uch as it is, especially with inflation. Most of the people being stolen from
by these com panies are not corporations, we cannot afford to fight for our copyrights, and it's unfair of them  to take advantage of our
work without our perm ission. This decision will have lasting repercussions towards not only our industry, but other industries that can be
taken over and replace work forces with AI. Our econom y is already struggling, please, please don't let this go through. It's so hard to
find jobs, even if you're not an artist. This will have long-term  effects that will effect us all.
