I do not approve of bypassing the AI restrictions placed by Former President Joe Biden. If this
passes through, it will encourage companies to replace workers with AI all for the sake ofkeeping profits to themselves. Voice actors, animators, and artists have been fighting againstthis trend because it means a lot of workers will be losing their jobs. Workers already have todeal with poor treatment from their higher-ups as it and seeing AI restrictions be bypassedmeans lack of quality control on various products, which will discourage consumers from everbuying whatever products are being produced.
