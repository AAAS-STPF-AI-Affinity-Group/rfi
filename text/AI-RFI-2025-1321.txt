General Comment
My nam e is Reese Theobald and I am  a m em ber of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High School. I com pleted a sem ester
course on AI and Ethics and studied the im pacts of Generative AI on the legislative process. E.O. 14179 will potentially bring about a
disruption to m uch of current attem pts to regulate AI developm ent at the state level. I believe that policy about regulation and governance
should be based on m any of the bills already passed at the state level. States such as Alabam a and Colorado have already passed a
variety of bills to ensure child safety and prevent ad m isinform ation and deep fakes. We cannot censor m isinform ation or deep fakes, but
we can provide resources for citizens to be m ore inform ed and aware of what a deep fake m ight look like, or the signs that deep fakes
tend to have. As a citizen who is soon to be an eligible voter and uses social m edia alm ost daily, the prevalence of deep fakes and AI
m isinform ation is m ore real than we can even im agine, and I encounter it on a daily basis. While I have personally educated m yself on how
to recognize these form s of m edia, not every person in this nation has, and in order for us to vote effectively we cannot be m isled by
prom pts given to AI from  som eone living in their parentâ€™s basem ent.
