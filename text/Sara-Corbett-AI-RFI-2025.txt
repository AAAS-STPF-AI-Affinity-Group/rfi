Hi,
I’m an art director at a publishing company. I work with editors, writers, designers and illustrators—and all of our
livelihoods are threatened by AI.
Computers should be a helpful asset to all Americans—not just the super-rich who want to avoid employing fellow
Americans. Our culture is threatened by computers, who can’t represent different people’s emotions, experiences,and unique artistry.
We absolutely need to outlaw AI to keep our status as a creative and intellectual superpower.Sara________________________________All e-mails to and from this account are for NITRD official use only and subject to certain disclosure requirements.
