General Comment
As an individual, I do not support the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. Not only would it infringe on m ultiple
existing laws, including those involving privacy and copyright, it will present m ajor long-term  consequences for countless industries. Jobs
will be lost, the econom y will plum m et, and our sense of security will disappear, all while the select few that would benefit from  this plan
continue to disrespect our country's people in ways that warrant distrust from  all sides, inside and out. I refuse to accept a legality that
leaves the public vulnerable to m ass exploitation and defam ation.
With the state it is in now, the AI Action Plan will do m ore harm  than good. Please rem em ber when developing an AI plan that AI should
be used to do well what hum ans do badly, not badly what hum ans do well.
