Hello, * Federal government can build supercomputers across the US, to train the AI models for 
different sectors such as Space, Defense, Health and to colonize other planets such as Mars * 
Build NAIA (National Artificial Intelligence Administration) just l ike NASA (National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration). * Allow people to visit the NAIA centers just like 
NASA. Just some thoughts. Thank you.
