As someone who is an artist I believe that you are giving ai too much control on the creative and academic field all  
for the sake of cheap profits. How dare you stifle the voice of the people with a cheap machine imitation. Ai could  
have truly been a way to improve the life of the average citizen but it is obvious that corporations would rather use  
these machines as a quick and cheap replacement of human work. I rather be educated and inspired by humans  
rather than a preprogrammed machine that doesnâ€™t even understand what text looks like. Artificial intelligence is  
meant to be our partner not our replacement.
