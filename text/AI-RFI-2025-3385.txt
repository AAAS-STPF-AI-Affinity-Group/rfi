General Comment
I don't think you realize how this'll com pletely destroy the entertainm ent industry, you'll literally run all creatives out and have nothing but ai
shlop left. Didn't your m others ever teach you stealing is bad? I'm  personally not surprised, you're all horrible and only care about m oney,
pathetic really, grim y, disgusting. If you believe in God, you know very well where he'll be sending you. But I guess it doesn't m atter cuz
you wont see what happens to the planet when your tim e will com e m uch before it, right?
