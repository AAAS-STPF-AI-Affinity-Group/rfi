General Comment
By eating ourselves alive we are giving China exactly what they want. Even ignoring the ethical debates on this m ove we are only
attem pting to win a shoving m atch to brute force China and challenging them  by doing this. With their resources they have already proven
an ability to outdo us, if we lose this we lose a m ajor fight that we ourselves openly picked and will deal a m ajor blow to the Am erican
people by being shown up on the world theater. If we win this we have to figure out a way to do it that goes beyond trying to do what
they are.
