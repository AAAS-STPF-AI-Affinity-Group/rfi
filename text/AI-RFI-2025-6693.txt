General Comment
I'm  going to be upfront. And if you end up enabling m ass AI, then you'll m ake NDAs ridiculously difficult to enforce. You ever try to be in
one?
I'm  in a few.
Plus on top of m any issues with security, if you start m ining the pentagon for data, then you'll end up with a ton of issues. Please do not put
this act into play.
Otherwise, this will heavily open up issues with security, revenge pornography, grotesque generations and use of libel in public security
cases. You technically could not stop m ore grotesque pornography from  applying to Sam  Altm an if you enable this into play.
I'll need som eone to sim ply take a sandal, approach Sam  Altm an and sm ack him  upside the head for m e. I'm  disabled and I need help
yelling at that guy.
Thanks a bunch!
