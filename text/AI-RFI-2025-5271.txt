General Comment
Current AI relies on LLM m odels that are not capable of generating true AGI and feeding them  m ore content does not address the
inherent problem s with their design. Giving AI m odels access to lim itless copyrighted m aterial will not actually benefit them  greatly or lead
to a worthwhile increase in the accuracy or use cases of the technology as it stands now but will directly hurt the creative fields that the
developers are stealing from .
