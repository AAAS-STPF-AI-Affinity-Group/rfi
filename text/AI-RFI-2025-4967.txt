General Comment
I support the concept of an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan but this plan m ust m aintain copyright and patent protections for corporations
and individuals. These protections encourage innovation and growth in the econom y, if they are rem oved it could severely dam pen
creativity and innovation in a way that hurts our ability to grow as a nation. AI m odels do need training m aterials and as such should be
free to use free use content or even copyrighted content if consented to by the copyright holder.
