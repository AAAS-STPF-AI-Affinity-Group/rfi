Dear Sir or Madam,
  I urge the OSTP to require AI model training to respect copyrighted materials, just as we humans must do. Those  
of us who write, paint, draw, et al do not owe AI companies an exception to copyright laws. If they wish to train on  
our work, they can pay for it; they should not be allowed to steal.
Sincerely,
Christopher Selvig
Colorado Springs, Colorado.
