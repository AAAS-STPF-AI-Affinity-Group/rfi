General Comment
I strongly advise against allowing anyone to train an AI off of m aterial that has no basis of perm ission or consent. It is laughable that I even
need to say this. We do not need to rescind the concept of copyright so that a few tech startups can have the totality of all creative thought
for the benefit of m aking m ore m oney. "Unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents" exist to keep people's ideas in the hands of those who
actually created them  in the first place. As an artist, I know that m y creative output is a part of m e. By allowing com panies to rem ove the
guardrails on what they can train, you are shoving m e into a m achine that will crush the life out of m y work. 
If that is not enough to convince you, then please listen to this. I work in technology. I know what will happen if you let the AI Action Plan
go through. Datasets will balloon in size while the large language m odels try to keep up. They will not be able to. The am ount of training
necessary for the advancem ent of current AI technology will not be accom plished through this effort. You know what you will get? A
bunch of overworked, burnt out, and sleep-deprived program m ers trying to m ake sense of it all. Even with all inform ation in the world at
their fingertips, they will still cut corners and take unnecessary risks. Because at the end of the day they're still a tech com pany. You will
not m ake Am erica an AI powerhouse by rem oving restrictions on the private sector.
