AI - including generative AI - is (in some ways) a great invention and useful tool. However it'salso important that we protect copyright holders. If a generative AI violates copyright law, orif a copyright is violated in the training of an AI model, the owning company must be heldaccountable.
 
Furthermore, any company with a large carbon footprint - regardless of field - must be heldaccountable for the pollution
 they're driving.  
Thanks for taking these into account.- August Zellmer, software developer
