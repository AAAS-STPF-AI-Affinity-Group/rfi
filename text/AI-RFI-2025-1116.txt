General Comment
The fundam ental problem  of com puter science has always been that we cannot m ake a m achine do what we want com pletely reliably.
Historically this has not m attered very m uch, but as com puter system s becom e m ore powerful and influential this m atters m ore and m ore.
Consider the big CrowdStrike outage last year. AI system s are on a path towards ever-increasing power and influence. System s like
com panies and governm ents are already far m ore powerful than individuals, so it seem s unlikely that hum ans represent the upper lim it of
AI capability. As AI system s becom e m ore powerful the am ount of harm  they will be able to do will increase. Unless the governm ent
steps in ahe trend of increasing AI capability will not stop on its own. Eventually the power these system s will possess will m ean that we
will be capable of substantial harm . And because we cannot rely m ake them  do what we want, they will try to do things we don't want. 
There are two fundam ental challenges we face: AI Capabilities keep increasing and we do not know how to m ake AIs do what we want
reliably. Governm ent should address these areas, and hold AI com panies to account in these areas.
