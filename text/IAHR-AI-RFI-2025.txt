Call for Inputs: Development of Ar�ﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Ac�on Plan (“Plan”)  
 
“This document is approved for public dissemina�on. The document contains no business -
proprietary or conﬁden�al informa�on. Document contents may be reused by the

The Investor Alliance for Human Rights  is a non-proﬁt ini�a�ve that supports  responsible 
investment that is grounded in respect for people's fundamental rights . A key focus area of our 
work over the past ﬁve years has been to promot e responsible investment in technology . This 
submission is focused on the perspec�ve of investors as stakeholders keen  to make rights -
respec�ng and ﬁnancially sustainable investment decisions in companies that responsibly design, 
develop, provide, deploy and/or use A r�ﬁcial Intelligence (AI)  systems within their direct business 
opera�ons and through their value -chain rela�onships.  
  
While the development and use of AI con�nues to have great poten�al to advance sustainable 
economic development, AI, and in par�cular the opacity of AI models, can cause and contribute 
to actual and poten�al harms such as  privacy and security viola�ons  of users’ data , whether as 
consumers or users of  AI systems;  as workers subjected to AI workplace monitoring ; or through 
the viola�on of ci�zens’ civil rights and liber�es through the deployment of AI.  
 
To ensure con�nue d conﬁdence in these systems and ﬂow of investments  to AI innova�on s, 
transparency around  AI development and deployment is cri�cal.  Any poten�al risks to users, 
consumers, workers or society at large , including children and marginalized groups , from the use 
of AI can lead to reputa�onal, ﬁnancial, and business risks and losses for companies , and  
nega�vely impact  investment returns .  
 
The establishment of  ﬁnancial and other incen�ves, as well as voluntary and  regulatory measures 
to enable trustworthy AI is cri�cal, par�cularly for responsible investors seeking long- term , 
sustainable  value crea�on and ﬁnancial returns .

 Global Leadership in AI  
  
To help the U.S. maintain global leadership in AI development and innova�on, the AI Ac�on Plan 
should include standard se�ng for U.S. companies that develop and/or deploy/use AI that are 
aligned with interna�onal frameworks and principles including, the U N Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights  and the OECD Guidelines for Mul�na�onal Enterprises on 
Responsible Business Conduct.  The U .S. has already shown its global leadership by signing the 
Framework Conven�on on Ar�ﬁcial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of 
Law, together with 39 signatories from around the world  with the Council of Europe . These 
interna�onal frameworks allow for a global level playing ﬁeld and have been the basis of the 
develop ment of incen�ves, guidelines , and regulatory measures in  countries in  Europe, Brazil, 
South Korea , Canada, Japan, among others.   
AI Safety Standards   
In the development of the AI Ac�on Plan, the rights and safety of American users, consumers, 
workers , and society must always be  protected and respected  as this makes for stable  and 
responsible investments and business  prac�ces . It is cri�cal to ensure  that: 
• The civil rights and liber�es of Americans , including privacy rights , are guaranteed and 
not violated by AI systems whether developed or deployed by the private  sector  or 
government.  
• The safety of Americans is protected par�cular ly from  high -risk AI systems , for example:  
“Predic�ve policing ”, which are AI systems used by law enforcement and criminal jus�ce 
authori�es to  make predic�ons , proﬁles , or risk assessments for the purpose of 
predic�ng crimes;  or non- discriminatory  AI-based individual risk assessments and 
proﬁling systems  in the migra�on context.  
• AI systems are transparent and fair and do not violate Americans ’ rights to be free from 
discrimina�on especially as it relates to  content being used to train AI models as well as 
the modera�on of content online . 
• Workers’ rights to privacy and dignity at work are also held to the highest standards  as 
workers  are the lifeblood of our economy.

The AI Ac�on Plan must develop tes�ng, evalua�ons, and guidelines that will help accelerate 
trustworthy AI innova�on in the U.S. and around the world and prevent the misuse of this 
technology by those who seek to undermine our public safety and na�ona l security. The 
con�nued role of the U.S. AI Safety Ins�tute -  established at the Na�onal Ins�tute of Standards 
and Technology to iden�fy, measure, and mi�gate the risks of advanced AI systems while 
harnessing the poten�al of AI technology - will be  vital for AI safety and standards under the AI 
Ac�on Plan.   
To enable businesses like AI developers to design safe AI systems and solu�ons  for Americans, 
businesses  should also undertake due dili gence processes that iden�fy, prevent , and address 
actual and poten�al adverse impacts on users, consumers, worker s, and society. I ncorpora�ng 
these  assessments into the product and service lifecycle will minimize exposure to poten�al 
liability, resul�ng in more stable and sustainable ﬁnancial returns. Companies must focus on long -
term value crea�on that beneﬁts all relevant stakeholders of the b usiness, including workers , 
users, communi�es, and society . The AI Ac�on Plan should incen�vize  and su pport businesses’ 
ongoing  engagement with these  stakeholders . These due diligence and engagement processes 
should also be undertaken by AI users and deployers in both the private and public sector s to 
address and mi�gate unintended adverse impacts on Americans.  
Na�onal Security   
Broad exemp�ons on the development and use of AI systems for na�onal security purposes must 
be scru�nized to ensure that use by military, law enforcement, and other government  or private 
en��es do es not override the rule of law and people’s civil rights.   
For example, the use of “security” technology , such as biometric recogni�on,  has been known to 
infringe upon civil right s through the targe�ng  of peaceful and legal protestors exercis ing their 
right to freedom of speech  guaranteed under the First Amendment of the U.S.  Cons�tu�on . This 
can also result in the silencing of diﬀerent viewpoints and voices  essen�al to our democracy. In 
addi�on, w here technology designed for security and military use is redeployed for public and 
civil use (e.g., use of surveillance tools to adhere to pandemic rules) without ﬁrst assessing 
poten�al  adverse and harmful impact s, while uninten�onal, may infringe upon  people’s rights .

Data Centers: Energy consump�on and eﬃciency  
As AI -driven technologies expand, they consume ever -increasing quan��es of energy that result 
in higher greenhouse  gas emissions . Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that data center opera�ons 
align with a just and sustainable energy transi�on , otherwise  the rapid growth of AI could 
exacerbate  the climate crisis  as well as exis�ng social and economic inequali�es, and lead to 
displacement, job losses, increased energy poverty, and human rights viola�ons.  To mi�gate 
these risks and promote equitable, sustainable AI development, AI -driven opera�ons must also 
leverage renewable energy sources that are responsibly sourced and do not contribute to 
environmental degrada�on or displacement.  Companies should commit to energy procurement 
strategies that do not harm  local American communi�es.  
Innova�ons in AI must  focus on energy -eﬃcient models and technologies that minimize 
environmental and social harm while maximizing societal beneﬁts. The AI industry must invest in 
workforce development and job crea�on ini�a�ves that support communi�es aﬀected by the 
energy transi�on, preven�ng economic displacement. Local  communi�es must have a voice in 
decisions regarding AI infrastructure, with mechanisms in place for meaningful consulta�on and 
redress if harms occur. By implemen�ng these re commenda�ons, the AI industry can contribute 
to a future where technological advancements do not come at the cost of environmental sustainability and human rights.  
Corporate Accountability  
The AI Ac�on Plan must also ensure accountability for harms  which businesses cause or 
contribute to and should enable and support the provision of adequate and eﬀec�ve remedy. For 
example, the plan should support the c rea�on of feedback mechanisms  for individuals and  public 
interest organiza�ons to lodge a complaint with na�onal supervisory authori�es rela�ng to safety 
and other viola�ons resul�ng from the development and deployment of AI systems that 
undermine fundamental rights or the public interest.

Conclusion 
As ﬁnancial actors that provide the capital for the development, deployment , and growth  of AI 
and AI systems, investors are important stakeholders in enabling trustworthy AI. To sustain the 
dominance of the U .S. in AI and ensure  a resilient economy, the innova�ons in AI should not pose 
material risks to investors  or human/civil rights risks to  other stakeholders. AI is a fast -moving 
domain, and the AI Ac�on Plan must  also include incen�ves and measure s to keep pace with 
technological development. Genera �ng trust in AI technology will require a commitment to 
transparency, fairness , and accountability, as well as a willingness to invest in the develop ment of  
robust frameworks. The responsibility for genera�ng this trust  falls on  businesses  that are 
developing and using AI systems , as well as on regulators,  by ensur ing that the se products and 
services are not causing harm.  
We hope that the Networking and Informa�on Technology Research and Development (NITRD) 
Na�onal Coordina�on Oﬃce (NCO), Na�onal Science Founda�on  will consider  our submission,  
and we are available at your convenience for any discussion about  our input s for the development 
of an AI Ac�on Plan.  
Yours sincerely, 
Anita Doret
