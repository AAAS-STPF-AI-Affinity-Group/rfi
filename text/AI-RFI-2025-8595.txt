General Comment
Large Language Models, like ChatGPT and other so-called "AI" technologies are only possible via large-scale unauthorized use of
m aterials under copyright. It is a perversion of justice to hold individuals to a standard of copyright law that large corporate entities are not
held to-- why is it okay for OpenAI to wholesale utilize works that are under copyright when Aaron Swartz was arrested and sentenced
to fifty years of jail tim e and a m illion dollars in fines? 
AI com panies should be held to the sam e standard of copyright law as every Am erican citizen.
