General Comment
Uncredited AI training is theft! If data is to be used for AI training, it should be com pensated fairly! Just because som ething can be
autom ated does not m ean that it should. Before prioritizing the financial wellbeing of billionaires, m illionaires, and conglom erates, we have
a duty to prioritize the well-being of our individuals, and investing in AI will only divest m ore people from  their jobs, rather than protect
those people in the m argins from  getting lost in the cracks of society. Everyone has the right to live in com fort. Nobody should have the
right to be a billionaire, and investing in AI is going to progress all the things in today's world that are antithetical to actual hum an
flourishing.
