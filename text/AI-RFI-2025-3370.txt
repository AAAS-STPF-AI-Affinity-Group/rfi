General Comment
The only action plan regarding artificial intelligence I could support is a plan to enforce patent, tradem ark, and copyright law with regard to
the collection and obfuscation of collection of creations from  hum an creators for the purpose of giving artificial intelligence patterns to
m ake flim sy facsim iles.
Better search algorithm s from  search AI is one thing. What is being developed, generative AI, starts out as a flagrant violation of
copyright, wastes excessive energy and m oney, doesn't com e close to the product developed by actual people, and all this in an attem pt
to avoid paying those actual people for their talents. The people in charge of generative AI are attem pting larceny and fraud. They should
be taken to court, charged and sued, and their assets used to fund art from  people.
