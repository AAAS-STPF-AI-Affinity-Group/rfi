AI steals from the livelihoods of Americans and profits off of theft. People do not want it.
People are purposely leaving Google as a search engine because of forced AI, using olderversions of windows or switching to Mac, or at the very least disabling it as much as possible.Please stop this madness. It's overhyped, and the only people who think it's intelligent arethose too undereducated for their current positions. While it does have a place, that place is inhyper-specific applications like detecting potential cancer before humans notice changes, notwith language learning models that don't actually learn language and don't understand realmeaning, and simply regurgitate stolen material. I genuinely hope if you do this the randomdice roll causes it to regurgitate Disney fan art based input and OpenAI gets sued by saidcorporation.
