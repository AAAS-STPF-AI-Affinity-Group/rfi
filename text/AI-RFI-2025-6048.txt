General Comment
"...and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents do not ham per private sector AI innovation."
Copyright is not an unnecessary burden. Stop letting greedy billionaires steal everything. The only way generative AI can continue to exist
is if it STEALS copyrighted work for profit. It's only a m achine that plagiarizes existing work and nothing else. It sucks and everyone
hates it.
Don't allow OpenAI steal every copyrighted work for profit. It's a business m odel based entirely on theft and does not deserve to exist.
