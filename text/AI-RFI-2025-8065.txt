General Comment
There is no future for Am erica in a technology like AI. It does nothing but deskills the Am erican worker, or at worst put them  out of
work. If Am ericans can't work to support them selves, their fam ilies, and their com m unities, there is no hope for Am erica to be great.
The future of Am erica m ust be in the hands of the Am erican people, not a com puter. To leave that future up to a com puter's (often fully
incorrect) decision is to full deny the Am erican dream  and what this country stands for.
AI has no place here.
