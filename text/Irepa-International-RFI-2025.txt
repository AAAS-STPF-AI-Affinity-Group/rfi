ExecuƟve Sum mary 
In response to the NSF Request for InformaƟon on the development of an AI AcƟon Plan, we 
present an innovaƟve strategy aimed at advancing arƟﬁcial intelligence (AI) to be a force for 
good in society. This proposal emphasizes the importance of non-biased, factual data, 
sustainable and self-regulaƟng AI data centers, autonomous companion robots (cobots) 
designed to enhance human well-being, and the need for AI to ensure that lean and small 
governments whose core responsibility is to protect the ConsƟtuƟon and the people are held 
accountable. By focusing on truth, sustainability, and human-centric design, we believe that our 
proposed model can help the U.S. maintain its compeƟƟve edge against adversaries within the 
United States and Outside. 
1.Non-Bias ed Truth and Factual Data for AI/ML/DL
The cornerstone of our proposed AI acƟon plan is ensuring that AI, Machine Learning (ML), and 
Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are grounded in unbiased, factual, and truthful data. AI models 
and systems must operate on data that reﬂects the most accurate and objecƟve knowledge 
available, drawn from veriﬁed sources across all disciplines of human endeavor. This will avoid 
the piƞalls of social media-driven opinions, ego-based biases, and misinformaƟon, which oŌen 
skew decision-making. By focusing on foundaƟonal knowledge, we ensure that AI applicaƟons 
provide transparent and fact-based outcomes, beneﬁcial to all sectors of society, from 
healthcare to governance and beyond. 
2.Circular Economy AI Data Centers
To support the eﬃcient and sustainable operaƟon of AI systems, we propose the creaƟon of 
circular economy AI data centers. These faciliƟes will be designed as self-sustaining, self-
regulaƟng, and decentralized systems that uƟlize a combinaƟon of GPU, CPU, and Quantum 
CompuƟng technologies. By intelligently distribuƟng computaƟonal tasks across these 
processors based on real-Ɵme workload demands, we ensure opƟmized performance and 
eﬃciency. 


Power consumpƟon within these data centers will be managed intelligently, with energy derived 
from sustainable sources such as solar, hydrogen, natural gas, and other renewable energy 
technologies. This approach will reduce reliance on centralized energy grids and promote 
localized energy autonomy, further increasing the resilience of the AI infrastructure. These data 
centers will be deployed in a distributed manner across communiƟes, businesses, and ciƟes, 
ensuring they are locally accessible, scalable, and capable of supporƟng diverse applicaƟons. 
 
3. Autonomous Companion Robots (Cobots) for Human Well-being 
Our proposal includes the development of autonomous companion robots (cobots) to serve as 
intelligent, personalized assistants within the home and oﬃce environment. Cobots will be 
designed to monitor and enhance human health, well-being, and producƟvity by interacƟng 
with various sensors and health devices (such as smart beds, exercise equipment, and biometric 
sensors). These robots will act as a central hub for an individual's daily acƟviƟes, providing 
collaboraƟve support and helping manage personal schedules, health, and mental clarity. 
Cobots will learn and adapt to the unique needs of each individual, fostering a deeper 
connecƟon between humans and their technology. By oﬄoading the burden of knowledge 
management and device control to the cobot, humans can focus on more meaningful human-
to-human interacƟons, opƟmizing their emoƟonal, mental, and spiritual well-being. This 
support will guide individuals toward personal growth by helping them transcend lower chakra-
based ego needs and focus on higher consciousness. 
 
4. Community Sustainability Through Cobots 
Cobots will play a pivotal role in fostering community-level sustainability. They will assist in 
developing organic gardens for growing fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices, enabling 
communiƟes to become more self-suﬃcient in their food producƟon. In addiƟon, cobots will 
support clean water iniƟaƟves by purifying and distribuƟng spring water, ensuring communiƟes 
have access to clean resources. 
In the economic realm, personal cobots will also facilitate decentralized transacƟons using a 
cryptocurrency network. This system will allow households to engage in buying, selling, and 
trading goods and services autonomously, free from the inﬂuence of centralized ﬁnancial 
insƟtuƟons. By enabling secure, peer-to-peer transacƟons, cobots will foster greater economic 
independence and resilience at the community level. 
 


5.Cobot as a Tool for Psychological and Social Health
The personal cobot will serve as a lifelong companion, from infancy to old age. It will not only 
assist with day-to-day tasks but will also be crucial in idenƟfying and addressing negaƟve 
psychological programming that could lead to issues such as narcissism, psychopathy, or 
sociopathic behavior. By acƟvely monitoring emoƟonal and social development, cobots will help 
guide individuals toward healthier emoƟonal states and social interacƟons. 
This role is parƟcularly vital in the context of the educaƟonal journey. Cobots will support 
individuals in their transiƟon from childhood through school and into the workforce, ensuring 
they are equipped with the emoƟonal intelligence necessary for successful collaboraƟon in 
business and government. By focusing on human connecƟon and well-being, the cobot will help 
nurture a society where individuals contribute posiƟvely to the collecƟve good. 
6.AI to Pol ice Lean and Small Governments
A criƟcal element of this acƟon plan involves the applicaƟon of AI to ensure that lean and small 
governments, which are responsible for protecƟng the ConsƟtuƟon and the people, remain 
transparent, accountable, and eﬀecƟve in their duƟes. AI will serve as a tool to monitor and 
assess government acƟons, ensuring that they remain aligned with consƟtuƟonal principles and 
the protecƟon of individual rights. 
AI systems will analyze and cross-check government policies, decisions, and acƟons, ﬂagging any 
discrepancies or deviaƟons from lawful, ethical, or consƟtuƟonal guidelines. By automaƟng the 
oversight of government funcƟons, we reduce the potenƟal for corrupƟon, abuse of power, and 
human error. This will provide an addiƟonal layer of accountability, making sure that public 
servants remain true to their obligaƟons and serve the people eﬃciently, fairly, and 
transparently. 
Conclusio n 
Our proposal outlines an ambiƟous and forward-thinking strategy to ensure that AI and 
associated technologies serve humanity in a meaningful and ethical way. By focusing on non-
biased data, sustainable AI data centers, autonomous companion robots, and using AI to ensure 
that lean and small governments protect the ConsƟtuƟon and the people, we aim to create a 
system where humans are supported in their journey toward personal growth, social harmony, 
and environmental sustainability. This proposal oﬀers a holisƟc approach that not only advances 
technological innovaƟon but also nurtures a healthier, more collaboraƟve future for all. 


We believe that our approach can posiƟon the United States as a global leader in AI and 
technology, promoƟng well-being, sustainability, and compeƟƟve advantage on the world stage.
