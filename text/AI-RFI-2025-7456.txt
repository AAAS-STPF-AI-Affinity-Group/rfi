General Comment
As a fan of hum an art especially for film  and TV, where perform ance has enduring, m onetary value. (Reflected in the industry in the form
of residual paym ents.) But if that perform ance can be ingested, analyzed, and recreated by AI without consent and without any
com pensation, m any's livelihood is directly threatened. If cast in a role to play a chef, I can't go to the grocery store, clean the m eat aisle
out of prim e rib, and say "Well I'm  sorry but I'm  a poor actor and I can't properly portray a chef if I don't train m yself by cooking all these
steaks." Sim ilarly, if AI com panies can't train their m odels without com pensating and getting consent from  the copyright holders, that's
solely a failing of their business m odel. It's not the governm ent's job to endorse or excuse theft - whether that theft is a grocery cart full of
steaks or a copyrighted perform ance, script, picture, or other work of art.
