General Comment
Allowing OpenAI or any AI com pany free reign to train their AI on any copyrighted work is a terrible m istake that fundam entally
underm ines creative works and the creative process. There is not enough m edia in the world to train generative AI to the level it would
need to be for it to be m ore useful than it currently is, so all allowing this exception would do is give AI com panies free perm ission to steal
anything they want and face no repercussions if and when the AI bubble bursts. Even if the bubble doesn't burst, allowing these com panies
free reign of all copyrighted works elim inates the purpose of copyright in the first place and the people who put their hard work and labor
into m aking these works.
