Proprietary and C onﬁdential – Do not distribute  2 pathogens, and novel toxins. We can’t aJord to let AI-driven tools enable bad actors to  design and synthesize 
dangerous biological agents  that put the Americ an people at risk . 
 
The U.S. must act decisively to prevent AI from being exploited to create bio weapon s while ensuring we remain at 
the forefront of AI -driven bioscience . 
 
1.1. Mandate AI Risk Assessments for Synthetic Biology:  All U.S. AI-driven protein engineering, gene synthesis, 
and pathogen modeling should undergo risk screening before execution  to ensure reasonable oversight.  
 
1.2. Create a National AI Biosecurity Task Force:  We should e stablish a cross -agency task force (OSTP , NIH, 
DARPA, and DOD) to monitor AI applications in biology, ensuring AI -powered synthetic biolo gy techniques/ tools 
cannot be exploited for developing biothreats or toxins.  
 
1.3. Secure DNA Synthesis & Pathogen Data Against AI Exploitation:  The U.S. should implement AI -driven

2. Take Back Control: Build Public AI Models for Biomedical Breakthroughs  
The growing dominance of private -sector AI models in biomedical research raises concerns about access, 
transparency, and neutrality. Many of these models are trained on proprietary datasets, limiting scientiﬁc 
reproducibility and public oversight. Additio nally, privately developed AI models reﬂect the priorities of their 
creators, which can inﬂuence healthcare decisions, drug discovery, and medical research in ways that may not 
align with broader public interests.  By funding open, government -backed AI mo dels, the U.S. can safeguard 
scientiﬁc objectivity, expand AI accessibility, and secure American leadership in biomedical AI research.  
 
2.1 Create Open, Government -Backed AI Model s for Biosciences:  To make sure  that AI -driven medical 
advancements remain both  accessible and grounded in rigorous science, the U.S. should establish a federally 
backed AI research program (NIH, NSF , DOE, OSTP) dedicated to developing large -scale foundational AI models for 
biology and medicine.  A federally funded alternative to private -sector models will ensure that AI -powered drug 
discovery, precision medicine, and genomics remain accessible to all without restrictive licensing barriers.  
 
2.2 Ensure AI Models Reﬂect Scientiﬁc Objectivity, Not Corporate Priorities: Publicly developed models will be 
transparent, auditable, and designed for scientiﬁc integrity, mitigating (or avoiding ) sources of  potential bias that 
arise when AI development is controlled solely by large tech ﬁrms.  
 
3. Establish AI -First Standards for Biological Data Collection  
The United States can gain a competitive advantage over its adversaries if its scientiﬁc institutions operate in a way 
that ensures interoperability/compatibility of our datasets.  Interoperability and data standardizatio n are essential 
to accelerating AI -driven breakthroughs in biosciences. However, the lack of consistent metadata standards 
across research institutions slows AI model training and hinders cross -institutional collaboration.  
 
3.1 Standardize AI -Compatible Metadata and Labeling for Biological Experiments:  The NIH and NSF should 
require that all federally funded biological research follows standardized data labeling and metadata practices 
optimized for AI training. The private sector should play a key role in shaping these standards, ensuring that data 
collected in academic labs, hospitals, and industry research centers is structured for seamless AI integration. 
Clarity around AI -ready data standards will speed up in novation, allo wing AI models to be trained on diverse, high -
quality datasets without the friction of incompatible formats.

multi -institutional health records.  
6.3 Accelerate AI -Based Clinical Trial Design:  The FDA and NIH should formalize AI -powered clinical trial 
guidance, allowing virtual trials and AI -simulated patient cohorts to accelerate drug approvals.  
 
6.4 Reduce IP & Patent Barriers for AI -Generated Discoveries: The USPTO should create clear patent guidance 
for AI -generated biological discoveries, ensuring AI -assisted innovations in genomics and drug discovery are 
protectable without unnecessary delays.  
 
7. Support AI -Driven Discovery of New Biological Principles  to Improve Human Health  
AI is allowing researchers to uncover new biological principles  faster than ever before – opening new fronti ers in 
medicine and making what was pre viously out -of-reach possible . However, China and  other adversaries  are 
aggressively investing in AI -powered biological research  as well  – without the commitment to open science  and 
intellectual pro perty sharing that  is hallmark of so much Americ an science . If the U.S. fails to act, we risk ceding 
leadership in foundational biomedical research, which underpins future advances in drug development, precision 
medicine, and synthetic biology.  
 
To maintain U.S. dominance in AI -driven biosciences, we must ensure that AI is not just used for analysis and 
automation but also as a driver of fundamental discovery.  
 
7.1 Create AI -Enabled Virtual Biology Labs:  The U.S. should establish federally funded AI -powered simulation 
environments where researchers can test AI -generated biological theories before conducting costly lab 
experiments . 
 
7.2 Accelerate AI Hypothesis Validation with Automated Labs:  AI should not just propose new hypotheses  — it 
should also be used to validate them , too. By integrating AI -driven robotics and automated lab workﬂows, 
researchers can test AI -discovered biological principles at scale, compressing years of wet -lab research into 
months.
