AI is not capable of what it is alleged to be capable of by the vast majority of marketing that has 
been produced for it. AI is a very simple tool that is capable of very simplistic pattern -related tasks. 
AI does not have the ability to do anything close t o what humans are able to do. It cannot replace 
humans. If we are going to use AI to replace humans, we will experience a massive downgrade in 
standards for whatever it is applied to. If this admin has truly bought into the misleading marketing 
around AI a s much as they appear to have and believe that it is so critical to the nation, then AI 
should be defined as a public good and taken into the ownership of the public, for it's benefits to be 
shared collectively, rather than by the few tech companies, whose  interests are not in improving the 
lives of Americans.
