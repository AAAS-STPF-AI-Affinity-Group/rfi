General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US! Please stop pushing to keep stealing for "training". 
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft! Art and creativity can't be bought and sold. You are STEALING
lives, passions, and the love of creating to be the push of a button.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. People are tricked by it left and right, photos of fake ai take the place of
real references and photos. The deluge of ads and ad ons on every one of m y devices is a nuisance and does NOT m ake m y life better.
ESPECIALLY if it's built off of THEFT. 
I have already had it take away so m uch, we (as artists and writers) have so little and it feels like no protection or rights. 
My life's work will not be chum  for the feeding of AI sharks.
