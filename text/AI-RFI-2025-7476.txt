General Comment
I do not believe that AI as it exists currently holds a place in the future of the US. AI as it exists now steals from  m y friends' livelihoods as
Am erican artists and writers, and it profits off of theft. Currently, AI is overhyped and is fleecing the Am erican public.
I believe there is a place for AI, where it can do good. But the current business m odels do not m atch that. At best, the current m odels are
no different from  crypto scam s or NFTs.
AI should be used to enrich everyone, not only a select few. And pushing people out of jobs that depend on these individuals' constant
creative input (as AI cannot feed on itself currently) is neither ethical nor intelligent.
Artists and writers are struggling enough. Don't m ake their lives even worse.
