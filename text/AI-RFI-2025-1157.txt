RE: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence Action  
       Plan   
To Whom It Concern: 
The Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA)
1 welcomes the opportunity to provide 
comments on the Request for Information (RFI) regarding the development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. As the only national trade association dedicated exclusively to 
serving the interests of community banks, ICBA represents thousands of community banks of 
varying asset sizes across the United States. Our member banks play a critical role in 
supporting small businesses, local communities, and rural economies, and as such, we 
recognize both the opportunities and challenges AI presents within the financial services 
sector. 
AI has the potential to significantly enhance the operations of community banks by improving 
efficiency, strengthening risk management, and enhancing customer service. However, as AI 
adoption increases, it is critical that regulatory frameworks evolve in a way that supports 
innovation while safeguarding consumer protections and financial stability. Community banks, 
which operate under different constraints than larger financial institutions, must be included in 
policy discussions to ensure that AI regulations are proportionate, fair, and practical for 
institutions of all sizes. 
Recognize Community Bankers as Early Adopters of AI 
Community banks have long been at the forefront of adopting innovative technologies to 
enhance operational efficiency, manage risk, and improve customer experiences. Many 
1 The Independent Community Bankers of America ® has one mission: the create and promote an environment where 
community banks flourish. We power the potential of the nation’s community banks through effective advocacy, education, and 
innovation. As local and  trusted sources of credit, America’s community banks leverage their relationship -based business 
model and innovation offerings to channel deposits into the neighborhoods they serve, creating jobs, fostering economic prosperity, and fueling their customers ’ financial goals and dreams. For more information, visit ICBA’s website at icba.org.

community banks utilize AI-driven fraud detection, credit underwriting, and cybersecurity tools 
to provide more precise risk assessments and protect consumers from emerging threats. 
Unlike larger institutions, which may develop proprietary AI models in-house, community banks 
generally rely on third-party service providers for AI-driven solutions. Thus, it is imperative that 
any AI policy framework supports community banks in leveraging AI technologies effectively, 
ensuring access to cutting-edge tools without imposing undue regulatory burdens that could 
stifle innovation and competition. 
ICBA has been a strong advocate for AI innovation, supporting initiatives that help community 
banks integrate AI into their operations responsibly. Through programs such as the ICBA 
ThinkTECH Accelerator, we foster partnerships between fintech companies and community banks to ensure that AI-driven solutions remain practical, scalable, and compliant with 
regulatory standards. AI solutions are helping community banks modernize their operations, 
improve credit decisioning, improve fraud prevention, and optimize customer engagement 
strategies. ICBA urges the Administration to recognize and support these innovation efforts as 
part of the broader AI Action Plan. 
Existing Regulatory Frameworks Provide Strong Protections 
Regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) establish foundational requirements around data security, fair lending, and anti-money laundering. AI adoption does 
not eliminate the need for compliance with these existing laws; rather, AI can augment 
community banks’ ability  to meet regulatory obligations efficiently. The Administration should 
recognize that AI-specific regulatory interventions must be carefully balanced with existing frameworks to avoid regulatory duplication, unintended consequences, or disproportionate 
compliance burdens on smaller financial institutions. 
ICBA urges that any new AI-related regulations follow the principles of regulatory streamlining 
and simplification, ensuring that community banks can maintain operational flexibility while 
fostering responsible AI adoption. By reducing redundancies and harmonizing regulations, 
community banks will be better positioned to allocate resources toward innovation and 
improving customer services, rather than navigating an increasingly complex compliance 
landscape. Consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order on regulatory reform, which 
aims to eliminate 10 existing regulations for every new regulation introduced, any AI-related 
policies should focus on consolidating and harmonizing current financial sector regulations 
rather than adding new burdensome requirements. This approach will ensure that AI innovation can thrive in the financial services industry while maintaining necessary consumer 
and systemic protections. Regulatory harmonization will also help reduce compliance costs 
and complexity for community banks, allowing them to focus on providing essential financial 
services to their local communities. 


3 
Support a Shared Risk Model Framework Between AI Developers and Banks 
Community banks generally rely on AI solutions provided by third-party vendors, meaning they 
often do not have direct control over the inner workings of AI models. Therefore, it is critical to 
establish a shared risk model in which AI developers bear appropriate responsibility for the 
reliability, transparency, and explainability of their products. We encourage the Administration 
to establish clear liability standards that fairly distribute risk between financial institutions and 
AI service providers. Such a model would ensure that community banks can continue 
leveraging AI innovations while mitigating risks associated with opaque AI decision-making 
processes. 
Harmonize Privacy Protections  
As AI systems increasingly rely on vast amounts of data, community banks remain steadfast in 
their commitment to safeguarding customer privacy. Anticipated data shortages stemming from 
privacy regulations, shifts in data availability, or changes in consumer preferences should not 
incentivize lax data protection practices or excessive data collection. The AI Action Plan must 
prioritize consumer data protection and privacy-preserving AI development, including the 
promotion of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as differential privacy and secure 
multiparty computation. Community banks must be empowered to utilize AI without 
compromising their customers’ trust or being forced into data-intensive practices that could 
create new risks. 
Engage Community Banks on the Utilization of AI in the Banking Examination Process  
As the Administration advances an “AI-first” posture, ICBA continues to observe financial 
regulators that  are increasingly considering AI tools for supervisory and examination 
processes. However, engagement with community banks on this issue has been limited. The 
AI Action Plan must encourage meaningful collaboration between regulators and community 
banks to ensure that AI is used responsibly within the regulatory ecosystem. AI-driven 
regulatory technology (RegTech) could streamline compliance reporting, enhance risk 
assessments, and improve the efficiency of bank examinations.  
However, transparency and oversight must accompany AI-based regulatory tools to ensure 
they are fair, unbiased, and do not create new burdens for community banks. Transparency 
measures should include clear documentation of AI decision-making processes, regular 
auditing of AI models for fairness and accuracy, and ensuring that community banks have 
access to meaningful explanations regarding AI-generated outcomes.  
Additionally, regulatory bodies should collaborate with community banks to develop best 
practices for AI governance that align with existing compliance frameworks. Community banks 
must have opportunities to provide feedback on the deployment of AI in supervisory practices 
to ensure its use aligns with their operational realities.

Maintain Work at NIST on Frameworks and Financial Sector Profiles 
ICBA strongly supports the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) work on 
the AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and its incorporation of financial sector profiles. NIST’s AI RMF provides a structured approach to managing AI-related risks and fostering 
trustworthy AI development. Banks have actively engaged with the AI RMF by participating in 
industry workshops, sharing feedback on its applicability to smaller financial institutions, and 
implementing risk mitigation practices based on its principles.
 However, improvements are 
needed to ensure the framework is tailored to the unique challenges faced by community banks, such as limited resources for AI governance and compliance.  
The Administration should work closely with community banks to refine the AI RMF and 
develop interoperability between cybersecurity, privacy, and AI frameworks. This will support 
the specific operational needs of community banks while maintaining robust risk management 
practices. Furthermore, the work at NIST should not be limited to developing highly specialized AI evaluation models; instead, it should encompass broader industry engagement and 
practical implementation strategies that align with financ ial sector needs. Community banks 
require frameworks that are adaptable, scalable, and aligned with industry best practices, rather than rigid or overly complex standards that may be impractical for smaller institutions to 
adopt.  
Conclusion  
ICBA appreciates the opportunity to contribute to the development of the AI Action Plan and 
urges the Administration to ensure that community banks remain central to the conversation. 
As AI continues to transform the financial services sector, it is essential that the Administration 
supports regulatory harmonization, establish es shared risk models for AI adoption, prioritizes 
consumer data privacy, and integrates community banks into AI-driven regulatory processes. We encourage ongoing collaboration between regulators, community banks, and industry 
stakeholders to foster responsible AI innovation while preserving financial stability and 
consumer trust. We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues further and to engage the 
Administration in crafting an AI policy framework that ensures community banks remain competitive in the evolving financial landscape.
