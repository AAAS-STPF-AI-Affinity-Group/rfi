General Comment
Artificial intelligence is not som ething that we should be just wholeheartedly trusting, especially without a plan for how to help the people
whose incom es are destroyed by the adoption of AI program s. I will always prefer a hum an do the heavy lifting in any job. This com m ent
period seem s m uch too brief and I would request an extension of the com m ent period. The use of educational, artistic, and otherwise
copyrighted works to train AI that is being developed by for-profit com panies, the end goal of which is to replace the incom e-producing
jobs of Am ericans, is a disgrace and an insult to hard working Am ericans. This policy should not go into effect and every effort to prevent
an AI takeover of governm ent roles and responsibilities should be m ade.
