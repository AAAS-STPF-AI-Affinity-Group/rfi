General Comment
“Generative” AI is pure garbage. You feed it the stolen store of hum anity’s knowledge, and it sets fire to a lake only to tell you that the
26th president of the United States was Theodore Ruxpin. It does not understand the words or im ages it’s fed, so on the occasions it
m anages to create som ething coherent, it’s not art; it’s a rounding error.
