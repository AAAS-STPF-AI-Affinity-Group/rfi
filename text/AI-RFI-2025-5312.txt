General Comment
AI is theft and poses a threat to everyone who m akes a living through art, writing, m usic, and m ore. AI cannot be held accountable and
should not have any legal recourse when it com es to stealing from  other works to train their code. Copyright m atters. Protecting the
integrity of works m ade by real people m atters. AI has no place here.
