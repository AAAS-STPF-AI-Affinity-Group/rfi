General Comment
Why are we as people, corporations, businesses, etc beholden to copyright if AI will not be? Surely just looking at what this has done to
search engines and the internet in general so far is obvious. Stolen content warped beyond recognition with all proceeds going to the one
who stole it. Im ages m ade up to stir anger. Im ages m ade to stir up confusion.
We are wasting resources we don't have. Energy we can't spare. Em ploym ent we can't risk losing all in the nam e of a technology that
hasn't even proved itself. Quite the opposite. The technology has proven m ultiple tim es that it hallucinates inform ation it does not have.
Spreads false inform ation based on these hallucinations. Spreads falsities as true (27F water doesn't freeze exam ple is widespread in
google. How in the world are we pushing for such protection for such an inadequate technology? It's been "waiting to get better" for years
now. It hasn't. It has gotten worse.)
We do not need to give this technology m ore power when it cannot utilize what it has. It needs to be reigned in or we're going to lose far
m ore than we gain.
For the love of all things precious to this country stop giving this technology that has proven itself a detrim ent m ore. If you're going to
m ake it beholden to none, then we should be beholden to none as individuals. If you can't do this, then this technology should not have any
boons.
