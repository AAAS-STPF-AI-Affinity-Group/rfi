General Comment
It's essential that the United States have a fair and equitable system  of copyright. So-called "AI" com panies' positions that copyright
shouldn't apply to them  -- a retrospective position, adopted after they engaged in the largest infringem ent of copyrights in hum an history --
should be rejected. Adopting such a position would create a two-tiered system  of justice, where an individual is liable for infringem ent for
downloading an ebook, but Facebook is allowed to download them  by the m illions without consequence. The incoherence of such uneven
application of copyright laws is readily apparent and unjustifiable.
The purpose of copyright is to encourage creation by offering protections for works which allows their creators to profit from  them .
Absent this protection, the supply of new works will dim inish, putting the US' leadership in num erous industries at risk.
As som eone who's had m y work infringed by AI com panies, this is a personal issue for m e. This behavior is inexcusable and shouldn't be
encouraged.
