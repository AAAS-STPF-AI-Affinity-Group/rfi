General Comment
Utilizing AI to "create" "art" will collapse all artistic industries. As the m odels are trained on the sam e content they will all return the sam e
content. There will be no variety. No innovation. The truly m om entous works of art, the truly successful works do things that haven't be
done before. That surprise and delight the audience. This will not be possible with AI creations.
