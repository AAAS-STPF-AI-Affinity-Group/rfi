AI programs are dangerous for the planet and the economy. They use too much water and electricity. Also they are
dumbing down society by stunting personal growth while stealing actual creators works. Throw in the fact thatcopyright law is different for each country. Thus, it is too dangerous to the U.S. economy to constantly deal withlawsuits from within and without. Finally AI programs are just prompt generators that humans are adding to and thismeans they are not intelligent in any way.
