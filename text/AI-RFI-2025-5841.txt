General Comment
Generative AI does not benefit anyone.
Generative AI is theft. It relies on stealing the hard work and skill of artists, writers, actors, and other actual creatives by violating their
copyrights and their consent.
Generative AI is not “creating” anything, and therefore does not deserve any advancem ent, funding, or any legal protection. 
We should be focused on uplifting creative professionals and protecting their work from  AI.
We have m any problem s facing our country, this is the least of our concern. This executive order is insulting and com pletely out of touch.
