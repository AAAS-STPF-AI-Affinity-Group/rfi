To whom it may concern,
      I strongly believe that AI should not have a future in United States. AI steals more fromthe livelihood of American citizens then it would contribute. As it stands now AI is more of apassing fad and something we shouldn't encouraged. AI will do more environmental harmthen it already has. Please do not let this go through.
-Sincerely,
A concern citizen
