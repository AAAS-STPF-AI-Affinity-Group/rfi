General Comment
AI has no place in the governm ent and AI has no place in art. 
The only thing AI enabled people to do is fraud and stealing, this is plain and sim ple. This only serves to line the pockets of the wealthy
and steal from  everyone else with abandon. 
This will destroy the art and culture in the United States as every piece of m edia and art will but put through the plagarism  m eat grinder
that is AI. 
If you care about art, if you care about the pictures the m em ories you posted online and don't want that to be abused and reduced to
som eone's profit without your consent. You cannot let it pass.
Protect the culture, protect the arts.
