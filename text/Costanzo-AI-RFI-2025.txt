This is a complete step in the wrong direction. Current AI development is based on the wholesale 
theft of intellectual property, all to create a technology that is extremely unreliable and cannot be 
counted on to accomplish even the most menial of tasks. R epealing the Biden administration's 
restrictions will place undue burden on the individuals and companies within the United States who actually created the intellectual property being stolen for AI development. This measure will rob intellectual property holders of money they are owed for the use of their intellectual property. Further, there are serious security concerns about the utilization of AI by the federal government. AI is prone to fabricating "information" and "evidence" wholesale, with no basis in reality. It is wholly incapable of accomplishing the tasks that federal workers are able to accomplish, and implementing it in government will only serve to waste more taxpayer money and render the federal government inefficient. The correct thing to do is to strengthen restrictions and regulations on AI development, not loosen them as loosening restrictions will only harm American citizens and businesses.
