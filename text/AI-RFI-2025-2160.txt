General Comment
I am  against US governm ent support and funding of large language m odels (e.g. ChatGPT) or generative AI (e.g. Midjourney). As a
creative who works with m usic and audio, I use tools that can be referred to as AI, but they are not LLMs or generative. 
LLMs currently operate utilizing so m any natural resources that an acceleration gives m e concern for ecological im pact. Along with this,
the quality of the responses from  these kinds of m odels are often inaccurate, and I am  concerned with social reliance on the technology.
There are num erous im provem ents that need to be m ade.
With this AND with generative AI, there also com es the issue of their usage of copyrighted data. Case law is still developing, but it is
leaning towards the direction of creators whose work and art are being stolen and poached for usage in LLMs and generative AI. Not
only is this plagiarism , but it also will destroy the careers of essential artists across the country. The quality of Am erican art will suffer for
the sake of corporate interest. Not only will this further cause instability in the job m arket, but it will dim inish our international respect and
lead to further unhappiness and dissatisfaction of life from  a large percentage of the constituency.
