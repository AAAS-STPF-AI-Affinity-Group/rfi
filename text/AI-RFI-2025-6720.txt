General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
AI is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and huge legal problem s by enabling
them .
If you can't run a business without stealing from  people, its not a business, its organized crim e.
