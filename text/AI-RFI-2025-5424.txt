General Comment
The fact that AI has been largely trained on copyrighted m aterial should disqualify it from  being used for com m ercial purposes of any kind.
It depends on stealing from  hardworking people world wide. It is sham eful for our governm ent to prom ote its use. Not to m ention the
environm ental im pacts of its use. It uses ungodly am ounts of water and it doesn’t even work as intended. This study showed that ai search
engines were incorrect 60% of the tim e! It is absurd to continue offering this as a valid option. https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/we-

I am  an artist, who’s work could very well have been stolen for this garbage technology. I’m  happy for ai to be used in fields where it is
appropriate but the product being sold to the Am erican public is just em barrassingly bad in every im aginable way.
