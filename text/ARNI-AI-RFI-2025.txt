Introduction 
 
NSF ARNI’ s mission  is to reach  the next level  of brain-like  AI. We aim to achieve  strong  
generalization  by connecting  the remarkable  progress  in AI systems  with the revolution  that is 
happening  in our understanding  of the brain.  This interdisciplinary  research  is what  we call 
“NeuroAI.”  Progress  in this field has the potential  to transformatively  impact  the economy  and 
society  in the next decade.  
 
Despite  stunning  advances,  there  are three  huge  weaknesses  for AI systems:  they depend  on 
enormous  training  data,  burn huge  amounts  of energy, and, most  critically , can make  egregious  
errors.  We seek to overcome  these  obstacles  by drawing  inspiration  from  the brain’ s 
architectures,  circuits,  and learning  mechanisms.  Our goal is to develop  AI with stronger  
generalization  and more  human-like  efficiency  and adaptability . 
 
The current  boom  in AI in fact is driven  by neural  network  models  inspired  by biological  neural  
networks.  The idea was that by taking  many  artificial,  simplified  nerve  cells,  or neurons,  and 
learning  how to connect  them,  we could  do hard computations  like the human  brain.  This 
learning-based  approach  to AI was totally  different  from  earlier  approaches  based  on logic  and 
design.  Eventually , with enough  data and computational  power , the neural  network  models  
started  working.  Once  that idea took root, massive  engineering  efforts eventually  led to successes  
in language  models,  generative  images  and video,  and robotics.  This approach  was so successful  
compared  to other  approaches  that one of the luminaries  of the field and recent  Turing  Award  
winner , Richard  Sutton,  penned  a short  essay  called  “the Bitter  Lesson”  in which  he said that our 
cleverest  ideas  didn’ t help:  only more  data and bigger , brute  force  compute  mattered.  We had to 
“go big.”  This current  approach  has its costs.  
 
First,  progress  was powered  by voracious  data centers,  burning  city-scale  energy and using  
thousands  of times  more  energy than our brains.  Some  engineering  efforts,  like DeepSeek  from  
China,  have  claimed  to dial back  the amount  of energy required,  but the consumption  of energy 
remains  huge.  
 
Second,  even  with unlimited  energy, we’re  running  out of data.  Language  models  are now 
trained  on essentially  all text ever published  by humans.  We cannot  just use machines  to generate  
more  text without  poisoning  the data by snowballing  mistakes.  
 
Third,  our best AI systems  remain  largely inscrutable,  still making  errors  that range  from  
amusing  to appalling.  They  cannot  be trusted  with important  decisions  in medicine,  economics,  
business,  law, and many  other  domains  where  common  sense  and reasoning  are critical.  
 
We believe  NeuroAI  is poised  to address  many  of these  challenges.  AI was originally  
revolutionized  by brain-inspired  neural  networks.  We now have  much  richer  knowledge  of the 
brain’ s inner  workings.  The time is right  for a NeuroAI  revolution,  one that incorporates  our 
impressive  new neuroscience  knowledge  about  biological  intelligences  honed  over eons.  
 
In the last decade,  neuroscience  has made  groundbreaking  progress  in measuring  and 
understanding  neural  activity  and learning.  We can now measure  up to a million  neurons  at the 
1 

same  time in a functioning  brain.  We have  now reconstructed  the wiring  of hundreds  of 
thousands  of neurons.  With these  data,  our analyses  have  discovered  core principles  of how 
countless  neurons  act together  to encode  information  about  the world,  make  decisions,  and drive  
complex  movements.  Neurotechnology  continues  to improve  rapidly . 
 
However , these  neuroscience  insights  have  yet to be integrated  into AI. Through  biologically  
inspired  architectures,  neuromorphic  computing,  and principles  of cortical  learning,  NeuroAI  
research  can lead to breakthroughs  in continual  learning,  energy-ef ficient  inference,  and 
explainable  AI. While  the impressive  and attention-grabbing  models  of the last couple  years  
made  advances  through  heavy  compute  and data,  our aim is to “Go Small”,  to take the brain  as 
an existence  proof  that we can use to inspire  advances  in these  directions.  
 
Additionally , Large Language  Models  (LLMs)  and Vision  Language  Models   (VLMs)  have  
created  a paradigm  shift in  AI, taking  systems  to a level  far beyond  what  was possible  even  five 
years  ago. These  models,  however , still have  significant  problems  in performance.  They  tend to 
hallucinate,  making  up facts  out of thin air, causing  difficulties  in using  them  in deployment;  for 
example,  recently  Apple  was forced  to take down  its news  summarizer  after it incorrectly  
covered  a BBC  news  report.  Models  operate  as black  boxes  making  explainability  and 
interpretability  difficult.  They  encode  the distribution  of their training  data,  making  accurate  
generalization  difficult  when  the distribution  shifts.   
 
There  is clear  competition  internationally , including  European  initiatives  like the Human  Brain  
Project  and China’ s aggressive  state-backed  investments  in neuromorphic  chips,  brain-inspired  
algorithms,  and next-generation  AI systems.  Leadership  in the face of such unconventional  rivals  
calls for stronger  interdisciplinary  collaborations  between  AI, neuroscience,  and cognitive  
science  — as fostered  by our NSF AI Institute.  
 
This document  presents  our recommendations  for incorporating  NeuroAI  into the NSF AI Action  
Plan.  
 
Our thesis:   
Investing  in interdisciplinary  Neur oAI resear ch at the intersection  of AI, neur oscience,  and 
cognitive  science  is critical  for the U.S. to maintain  its leadership  in artificial  intelligence,  
particularly  as Europe and China  make  significant  advances  in this field.  
 
Our Recommendations on Research and Development 
Priorities 
 
Our recommendations  can be divided  according  to the essential  focus  on the bidirectional  
interaction  between  AI and neuroscience/cognitive  science.  We first present  priorities  that 
address  how cognitive  science  and neuroscience  can inspire  AI, and then on AI’s contributions  to 
advancing  these  fundamental  areas  of research.  We then discuss  additional  recommendations  
considering  how AI research  can play key roles  in society  and internationally .

I. Gaining inspiration from neuroscience and cognitive science to 
advance 
 
Brain-Inspired AI Architectures 
● NSF should  prioritize  research  in biologically  plausible  neural  networks  at both the 
hardware  and software  level.  Relevant  approaches  to explore  include  spiking  neural  
networks  (SNNs),  neuromorphic  computing,  networks  with recurrence  and feedback,  
networks  with excitatory  and inhibitory  cells and their subtypes,  and roles  of dendrites  in 
computation.   
● Strategically  support  commercialization  of neuromorphic  chips,  which  remains  limited.  
● Encouraging  collaboration  between  AI researchers  and neuroscientists  to develop  AI 
models  that leverage  brain-like  processing  for improved  learning  and generalization.  
● Supporting  the development  of hybrid  architectures  combining  traditional  deep  learning  
and neuroscience-inspired  models.  
 
Developing Neuroscience Foundation Models 
● Create  multimodal  foundation  models  capable  of translating  and predicting  neural  
activity  across  different  brain  regions  and behaviors.  
● Leverage  self-supervised  learning  on large-scale  datasets  to enable  cross-subject  
generalization.  
● Improve  BCI adaptability  and robustness  with minimal  training  data and cross-species  
learning.  
● Ensure  accessibility  by providing  open-source  models  and APIs  for broad  research  
adoption.  
 
Establishing Neuroscience Benchmarks 
● Launch  benchmarking  challenges  to assess  model  performance  on diverse  neural  
datasets.  
● Focus  on evaluating  generalizability , robustness,  and prediction  accuracy  across  species  
and recording  conditions.  
● Utilize  models  for quality  control,  detecting  artifacts,  and refining  neural  datasets.  
 
Neuroscience-Informed Learning Models 
● Prioritize  funding  research  into biologically  inspired  learning  mechanisms  such as local  
rules  of synaptic  plasticity , along  with possible  gating  of learning  by modulatory  factors  
and by inhibition  of top-down  inputs;  memory  consolidation;  and predictive  coding.  
● Exploring  the role of sleep  and replay  mechanisms  in AI model  optimization  and 
continual  learning.  
● Consider  modules  that focus  on different  forms  of learning,  inspired  by the major  
divisions  of vertebrate  intelligence.  These  include  a cerebellum,  which  is involved  in 
3 

online  learning  from  feedback  about  errors,  and basal  ganglia,  a center  for reward  
learning  and for procedural  learning.  The vertebrate  brain  also includes  a forebrain  or 
telencephalon,  which  in mammals  has primarily  become  the cerebral  cortex,  which  does 
associative  learning  and builds  complex  world  representations.  There  is a rich interplay  
between  the three.  Understanding  the principles  behind  this modular  design  might  benefit  
AI, and conversely , exploring  AI built upon  such modules  might  help reveal  these  
principles.  
● Another  modular  design  feature  to explore  is the division  within  the cortex  between  
episodic  and factual  learning  (“knowing  that”),  which  depends  on the hippocampus  and 
its interplay  with the rest of cortex;  and motor  and procedural  learning  (“knowing  how”),  
which  depends  on the interplay  between  cortex  and basal  ganglia.   
● Promote  energy-ef ficient  AI algorithms  inspired  by the brain’ s adaptive  learning  
processes.  
 
Neuro-Symbolic AI for Explainability 
● Encouraging  the development  of hybrid  Neuro-Symbolic  AI systems  that integrate  neural  
network  learning  with symbolic  reasoning,  inspired  by hierarchical  processing  in the 
brain.  
● Investigating  how cognitive  neuroscience  insights  can improve  AI’s ability  to abstract,  
reason,  and generalize  across  tasks.  
● Supporting  research  in AI models  that mimic  hierarchical  decision-making  observed  in 
the human  brain.  
 
Advancing AI through Neural and Cognitive Mechanisms 
● State-of-the-art  models  hallucinate  and inherit  skews  based  on their training  data,  
preventing  strong,  reliable  generalization.  
● While  humans  and other  animals  learn  continuously , gaining  abilities  in new tasks  and 
domains  while  not losing  past skills,  current  models  forget when  tuned  to new data.  
● Incorporating  memory  mechanisms  in current  AI models  is a promising  approach.  
● Prioritize   funding  on continual  learning  to develop   new learning  approaches  based  on 
cognitive  memory  mechanisms.  Improved  evaluation  of models’  ability  to learn  over 
time.

● Encouraging  research  on neural  network  architectures  and objectives  that yield  more  
energy-ef ficient  models.  
● Encouraging  research  on neural  network  models  that can flexibly  trade  off different  costs,  
such as energy, errors,  and inference  time.  
● Supporting  theoretical  work  on the energy-ef ficiency  of neural  computations  in biological  
and engineered  systems.  
● Supporting  research  into neuromorphic  computing  hardware  inspired  by the brain’ s 
low-power  processing.  
4

fault tolerance  can improve  AI safety . 
● Support  development  of AI models  that incorporate  robustness  and resilience  similar  to 
biological  cognitive  processes.  
● Supporting  research  in adversarial  robustness  using  principles  from  the brain’ s error  
correction  mechanisms.

AI for Understanding Brain Function 
● Promoting  AI-driven  analysis  of large-scale  neural  datasets  to accelerate  neuroscience  
discoveries,  leading  to new hypotheses  and insights  about  brain  function,  and improved  
understanding  of cognitive  processing.   
● Supporting  research  to develop  AI models  that replicate  cognitive  functions  such as 
attention,  perception,  and memory . 
● AI for improved  neural  signal  and behavioral  video  processing

● Ensuring  ethical  AI development  in BCIs,  addressing  concerns  regarding  privacy  and 
security . 
● Supporting  real-time  adaptive  AI algorithms  for improved  human-AI  interaction  via 
neural  interfaces.  This requires  algorithms  for using  both input  and output  hardware,  
reading  from  and writing  to the brain.

Understanding Animal Cognition through AI 
● AI models  trained  on human  cognition  can help study  non-human  intelligence  and 
cognitive  evolution.  
 
III. Additional Priorities 
 
Enhancing AI Benchmarks,  Evaluation and Methods for Vision and Language 
Tasks 
● Research  is needed  into new benchmarks  for challenging  tasks,  along  with appropriate  
evaluation  methods.   
○ This will enable  extension  of LLMs  and VLMs  to new, creative  tasks,  where  they 
have  been  shown  to perform  poorly .  
○ Research  has shown  that human  evaluation  of LLM  output  is flawed,  likely  due to 
the fluency  of the language,  and new human  evaluation  protocols  are needed.  
○ At the same  time,  automatic  metrics  that can accurately  judge  novel  tasks  are also 
needed  (e.g.,  has stance  been  conveyed  when  generating  perspective  summaries?).   
● Promising  directions  for improvement  in hallucination  includes  grounding  generation  in 
intermediate  knowledge,  detecting  and addressing  subjectivity  in the output,  and the use 
of  interacting  agents  that can critique  each other  through  approaches  like red-teaming,   
● As we move  to new tasks  involving  creativity , promising  directions  include  synthetic  data 
generation  when  paired  with good  verifiers.   
○  Inference  time scaling  and post training  are incredibly  powerful  for tasks  with 
verifiers.   
○ Developing  verifiers  for creative  tasks  is still in its infancy .  
● Research  in cognitive  modeling  can help in developing  new approaches  that are better  
aligned  with human  behavior , helping  to guide  a model  in where  to focus  attention  in data 
to avoid  encoding  skewed  distributions  and to learn  how to update  knowledge  
appropriately  over time.  
●  For all methods,  we need  new approaches  that are computationally  more  efficient.   
○ Research  into text diffusion  models  is in early  stages  and shows  promise,  in some  
cases  showing  similar  performance  as LLMs  at a fraction  of the cost.  
 
Societal Implications of NeuroAI 
● Addressing  policy  concerns  related  to AI systems  that mimic  human  cognition  and 
decision-making  processes.  
● Establishing  guidelines  for the responsible  use of NeuroAI  in critical  applications,  
including  medical  and defense-related  domains.  
● Encouraging  public  engagement  and discussion  on the societal  impact  of AI systems  
modeled  after human  brain  functions.

International Competition and the Need for U.S. Leadership in NeuroAI 
● China,  UK, and Switzerland,  followed  by the European  Union,  Canada,  and Japan  are 
heavily  investing  in Neur oAI resear ch, recognizing  its strategic  importance  for 
futur e AI advancements . Areas  of focus  pertain  neuromorphic  hardware,  computational  
models  of cognition,  and frontier  areas  of research  e,g, brain-inspired  deep  learning,  
reinforcement  learning,  spiking  neural  networks  and robotics  to name  a few. In particular , 
China  has launched  major  national  initiatives  in brain-inspired  computing,  neuromorphic  
chips,  and cognitive  AI, integrating  neuroscience  with AI to enhance  efficiency , 
intelligence,  and adaptability .  
● The Chinese  government  has established  dedicated  research  centers,  significantly  
increased  funding,  and fostered  collaborations  between  industry  (Huawei,  Cambricon  
technologies,  Baidu  Brain)  and academia  (Peking  University , Fudan  University)  to 
accelerate  progress  in this domain.  Their  major  initiatives  include  China  Brain  Project  
and the New  Generation  AI Development  Plan (2017-2030)  that prioritize  human  
brain-inspired  AI research.   
● To maintain  U.S. leadership  in AI, it is crucial  for NSF and other  federal  agencies  to  
○ provide  sustained   strong  funding  and infrastructure  support  for research  at the 
intersection  of AI, neuroscience,  and cognitive  science  
○ Support  the ever-growing  AI hardware  sector  (BCIs  and neuromorphic  chips)  
○ Invest  on academia-industry  consortia   
○ workforce  development
