General Comment
Hello,
I am  an author. My entire life is oriented around crafting stories and art for young readers. I have seen first-hand the power of storytelling,
and I have had the honor of witnessing lives changed by the pursuit of art and articulation. 
I absolutely detest the cowardly thinking that has lead people to believing AI is a worthwhile tool for the creation of art. It has no place in
the future of the US, or any country that recognizes the value in a brilliant and creatively-enabled citizenship. Even if the technology could
generate som ething truly original, it would still only be because of it's vapid plagiarism  of hum an-m ade art and ingenuity, m eaning no AI-art
can be considered original, ethical, or even interesting.
Am ericans are being tricked by people with no foresight, no m orals, and--worst of all--no taste. We do not want these com panies to steal
m ore than they already have. 
-Ryan
