General Comment
Generative AI for im age, video, and text has little practical use beyond m isinform ation and overuse of resources. The downsides far
outweigh the positives for anyone who isn’t a m ajor stakeholder in the com panies developing this technology. Generative AI is
contributing to cognitive decline in m edia literacy in people of all ages, creativity should not be a com m odity that’s autom ated for us.
