General Comment
I do not trust the governm ent, nor any Artificial Intelligence business with m y personal inform ation and m y business (art and content
creation). They have proven over the years to abuse this trust with individuals and I do not want anything related to m yself to be taught to
AI without any form  of consent, which this 'Plan' would do so without consent in the larger picture even when checking the "opt out" box.
