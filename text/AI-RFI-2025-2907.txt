General Comment
OpenAI should not be protected or im m une to he legal processes of Copyright, intergrating OpenAi and the ability to steal without
repercussions is not healthy for creatives or any other future process. The Am erican people struggle enough to live and create, m aking it
so they are always under threat regardless of copyright laws would dissuade people from  creating things even m ore than they are today. If
we do not draw the line here, AI will take jobs, and m ore the further we let it know that it can just take from  real people without
repercussions.
