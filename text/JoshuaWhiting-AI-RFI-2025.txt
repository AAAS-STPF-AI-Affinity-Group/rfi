I oppose giving A.I. companies the right to use copyrighted works to train their models. The
argument that they must do so in order to pull ahead of other countries is unsound. It ignoresthe possibility of finding other ways to effectively train them without restoring to taking thatwhich they did not create without compensating those who did. It would also set a badprecedent; if taking copyrighted works is "necessary" now, what will it be "necessary" to takein the future? If winning the A.I. race is so important that it justifies taking copyrighted works,what else might justify taking things in the future?
Do not enable A.I. companies to consolidate power even further by taking away from the
creative people of our country, who put so much of themselves into their work,
  not to enrich
themselves, but to enrich our lives and our culture.
Sincerely,
Joshua Whiting
