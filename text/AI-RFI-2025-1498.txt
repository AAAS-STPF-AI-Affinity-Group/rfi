General Comment
AI can and will be essential to sm all businesses in the future, but that com es with the caveat of large corporation and tech giants like
OpenAI and google being constrained within the sam e rules as everyone else. 
Please do not let these com panies waive the current copyright status of works/data in order to further fuel their advantage. Copyright
exists to protect the works of the average Am erican and they're trying to circum vent it wholly. This is beyond anti-com petitive with their
argum ent for allowing the use of copyrighted data to train their m odels without any sort of com pensation. It's anti fair use, and anti
business for everyone involved. What incentive is there to create if everything will be used for the sake of power and profit from  the few. 
Thank you for taking the tim e to read, and I do hope you consider the ram ifications for the future generations to com e as well.
