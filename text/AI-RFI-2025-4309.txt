General Comment
As a lifelong citizen of the United States of Am erica, I understand the im portance of m aintaining dom inance in the technological sector in
order to stay ahead of our adversaries. However, I don't believe that such dom inance is worth the trade off letting the private sector run
wild with even fewer restrictions than they already had.
Com panies in the private sector that have heavily invested in AI are interested in training their AI m odels on copyrighted m aterial, m uch of
which is m aterial that's created by hardworking Am ericans and legally considered as belonging to them . If these AI com panies are allowed
to train on m aterial that doesn't belong to them , then it's akin to theft of one's property. Therefore, it should either not be allowed, or there
should be som e form  of m onetary com pensation given to those who have had their work used by AI com panies.
And that's only touching on the m atter of copyright infringem ent. There are other concerns that lessening AI restrictions involves, such as
privacy, ethics, and avoiding raising the unem ploym ent rate. There is m uch potential for AI to coexist with sane, com m onsense, and fair
regulation. I highly recom m end using the policies outlined in Executive Order 14110 as the fram ework for a new set of AI regulations that
will benefit the com m on Am erican citizen.
