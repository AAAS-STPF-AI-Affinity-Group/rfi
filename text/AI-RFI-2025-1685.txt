General Comment
As an artist, I need copyright protection to protect m y work and incom e as an Am erican citizen. Generative AI is actively harm ing the
work that I do. It is allowing people to piggyback off the hard work of other creatives without lifting a finger. I went to college and taught
m yself beyond that to be able to do what I do. I have already lost opportunities due to the use of this technology being unregulated in its
current state. Opening Generative AI up to being able to train on copywritten m aterials would be absolutely devastating to individuals like
m e, sm all business, and likely larger production com panies as well. Generative AI is not innovation, it is only recycling the work of others
to create inferior results.
