AI enhanced to perform accurate credit monitoring. The credit monitoring companies all but equifax is severely  
flawed. Extremely long time correcting errors, 90 percent of the employees are across seas. Sometimes they don’t  
even investigate that just mark the information as accurate even when it is not. It is extremely outdated and way to  
easy for anyone to place reports on your credit. For example a person fills out a job application with a fraudulent  
apartment complex was charged $250 for a background check. This company then doesn’t like the Google review  
posted about them and makes up a document stating the person owes them money without including any further  
details and it is placed on the credit report with no way of removing it. Then when u get it removed they come back  
again and able to place the same report on your credit report even though it was previously advised as an error on  
the previous report. Again a outdated system when credit is the way of life in 2025 I don’t think it’s fair to have  
these companies feeding off the American people then we have to jump through tooth and nails to have it repaired.  
The agencies are operating way pass their experation date and a day where AI is so sophisticated I don’t see the  
purpose of them.

I think the AI should be able to analyze data as well as the individual to determine whether it would be in the best  
interest of the individual as well as the United States to penalize said individual or justify an action against said  
individual during a time which they were experiencing hardship. Example the IRS penalizing an individual that was  
already living way below the poverty level maybe even experiencing homelessness for not including survivors  
benefits or money from door dashing in their income tax. Pushing the individuals income from that year up to 27000  
instead of the 21000 reported. The individual was still way below the poverty level for the year 2022. Instead the  
IRS audited this individual 3 years later stating they did not report the income although even with the math in their  
hand is still below poverty level.
 I feel like an AI equipped with the right information could prevent things like this from happening in the future. I  
feel like the system used at the IRS is not only outdated but unrealistic which in the end cost the city more. How  
does it cost the city more because now that individual will need public assistance to make up for the money lost  
because it will cause more hardship in the long run rather than correcting the data in the system using the  
appropriate taxes they are twiddling their thumbs and pushing any button without being properly trained to view the  
details of the case in front of them. This would make a perfect inclusion to the AI system and less need of lazy  
button pushers at the IRS.
