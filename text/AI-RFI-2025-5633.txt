General Comment
No com pany working on or with AI should be allowed to steal and profit off the work of creative Am ericans, m yself included.
The hype behind AI has largely been overstated to drive up the m arket and we've aleady started to see the dam age that this m anufactured
hype can and probably will continue to have on our econom y. 
Leaving com panies working with AI unregulated and unaccountable, will ultim ately increase the potential harm  it poses on the econom y,
Am erican culture, and it will set a dangerous precident for years to culture.
