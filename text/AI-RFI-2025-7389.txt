General Comment
Public Com m ent on the AI Action Plan
To Whom  It May Concern,
I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. While fostering AI innovation is essential for
m aintaining U.S. leadership, this plan m ust also address critical concerns related to ethics, transparency, accountability, and public trust.
Below are key recom m endations that should be considered in shaping AI policy.
1. Ethical AI Developm ent Must Be a Priority
The plan m ust include safeguards to prevent AI system s from  perpetuating bias, invading privacy, or being m isused. Without strong ethical
guidelines, AI could disproportionately harm  m arginalized com m unities and erode civil liberties.
Bias Mitigation: AI m odels m ust be rigorously tested for algorithm ic bias before deploym ent, particularly in areas like hiring, law
enforcem ent, and healthcare.
Privacy Protections: AI-powered surveillance and facial recognition m ust be regulated to prevent overreach, ensuring that individuals'
rights are not violated.
Accountability Measures: Developers m ust be held responsible for the negative consequences of AI-driven decisions, with clear guidelines
on liability and redress.
A pro-innovation approach m ust not com e at the cost of ethical responsibility. AI system s m ust align with dem ocratic values and hum an
rights protections.
2. AI Innovation Must Benefit All, Not Just Corporations
AI should not be dom inated by a few large tech com panies or m ilitary applications. The U.S. m ust ensure that AI innovation benefits sm all
businesses, underserved com m unities, and public institutions.
Funding for Public AI Research: Governm ent investm ent in non-profit AI projects can support healthcare, education, and environm ental
applications.
Reducing the Digital Divide: AI advancem ents should not exacerbate econom ic inequality—rural and low-incom e com m unities m ust have
access to AI-driven tools.
Workforce Readiness: The plan m ust include reskilling program s to help Am erican workers adapt to AI-driven changes in the job m arket.
Without inclusive policies, AI will further entrench econom ic and social disparities. AI governance should ensure that innovation serves the
public good, not just corporate profits.
3. Transparency and Accountability Are Essential
Many AI system s operate as "black boxes," m aking decisions without clear explanations. This is unacceptable, especially in crim inal
justice, hiring, finance, and governm ent services.
Explainability Standards: AI used in high-stakes decision-m aking m ust provide clear, hum an-readable justifications for its actions.
Independent AI Audits: AI deploym ents should undergo third-party audits to ensure fairness, accuracy, and com pliance with ethical


guidelines.
Public Access to AI Im pact Assessm ents: Any AI system  used by the governm ent should be subject to m andatory transparency
requirem ents, ensuring that the public can understand its im pact.
AI cannot be allowed to m ake life-altering decisions without oversight. Transparency m ust be a non-negotiable requirem ent.
4. Public Education and AI Awareness Must Be Strengthened
Without widespread public knowledge about AI, m isinform ation and m isunderstanding will grow.
AI Literacy Program s: Public education initiatives should teach how AI works, its risks, and how people can protect their rights.
Regulation of AI-Generated Misinform ation: Deepfakes and AI-generated content m ust be closely m onitored to prevent m anipulation in
elections and public discourse.
An inform ed public is essential for dem ocratic decision-m aking on AI. Without proactive education efforts, AI policy will be dictated
solely by corporate interests.
5. International AI Cooperation is Critical
AI is a global issue, and the U.S. m ust take a leadership role in establishing international AI safety standards.
Global AI Safety Agreem ents: AI risks—including autonom ous weapons and cyber threats—m ust be addressed through international
treaties.
AI Ethics in Trade Agreem ents: The U.S. should integrate AI governance and ethical standards into global trade discussions to prevent
exploitative AI practices.
By working with allies, the U.S. can ensure AI is developed responsibly, preventing authoritarian regim es from  exploiting AI for
surveillance, repression, or disinform ation.
Conclusion
The AI Action Plan m ust not focus solely on deregulation and reducing barriers to AI expansion. Instead, it m ust ensure:
- AI developm ent aligns with ethical standards
- Innovation benefits the public, not just large corporations
- AI decision-m aking is transparent and accountable
- Public education initiatives strengthen AI literacy
- The U.S. leads in global AI safety and cooperation
I strongly urge policym akers to prioritize responsible AI developm ent that safeguards civil liberties, econom ic fairness, and public trust.
The future of AI m ust be shaped with careful oversight, not just a race for dom inance.
