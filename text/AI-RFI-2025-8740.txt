General Comment
Generati ve AI is theft. Generati ve AI takes uniqueness and creati vity and pushes it throu gh a corporate &^%, using processes that 
under any reasonable persons understandi ng would be flagrantly illegal and immoral. Generati ve AI has already made many parts of 
the internet  measurably worse, push ing out hallucinations to a degree that is strai ght up laughable. Generati ve AI is destroy ing our 
planet and setti ng our atm osphere on fire at a ridicu lous rate for very little upside, just the possibi lity that our ol igarchs cou ld be 
able to lay off their  em ployees and keep a customer base, even with a far inferior product.
Most peop le don't want to read AI books, watch AI movies, listen to AI music, look at AI art, or e ven want AI answers on search  
engines. It's a ll so incredibly stupid and exploitative.
