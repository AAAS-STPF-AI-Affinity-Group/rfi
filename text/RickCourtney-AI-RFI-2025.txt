I work in the design and technology industry and my day to day often interacts with AI
software and discussions. I'm commenting on OpenAI claiming they can not continue withoutremoving copywrite law. Their request is insulting to human creation and is little more than aprivate tech firm begging for a bail out by permanently destroying any protections that wehave for every writer, artist, filmmaker, and worthwhile creative endeavor. This is happeningbecause they can't hit their investment targets if they have to follow laws. They can't afford tonavigate inherent training issues in AI development if they have to pay for copywritematerials. It's beyond insulting, but it's also very dangerous and would serve no purpose otherthan to stratify wealth further away from Americans and give it to a tech billionaire. Othercompanies like Google are 
 latching onto this call, not out of the benefit it would bring to
society, but because they realize how much money they will make when they no longer haveto pay Americans for the things we produce. They would become digital pirates protectedunder the law, and all of us would become their victims.
