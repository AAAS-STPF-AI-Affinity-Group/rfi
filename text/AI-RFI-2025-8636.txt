General Comment
Allowing com panies to infringe on the rights of others by stealing and using their work for profit is an affront to the freedom  of individuals
to have exclusive rights to their creative work. I and m any others strongly oppose the idea of giving com panies free reign to infringe on our
rights, which m eans I stand strongly against the idea of presidential overreach to allow such action.
