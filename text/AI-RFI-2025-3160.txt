General Comment
Speaking on m y own behalf, I do not think AI has a place in governm ent, or the future of the U.S. in general. AI has been hyped up by
num erous technology leaders for over a decade now, and there have been no real results to show. There has been little value to AI
despite all of the resources sunk into it. 
Num erous tim es I have seen google AI give blatantly wrong answers at the top of a google search when the result gives a correct answer
instead.
This is also not to m ention he ability of AIs to deceive. Num erous articles like:
https://www.sciencealert.com /ai-has-already-becom e-a-m aster-of-lies-and-deception-scientists-warn
https://c3.unu.edu/blog/the-rise-of-the-deceptive-m achines-when-ai-learns-to-lie
Have already shown that AIs have shown a capability or willingness to deceive. This is a dangerous developm ent and could be disastrous
under the wrong circum stances.
AI also gets so m uch of it's data from  copyrighted resources. SO m any tim es there have been tim es where AI has been trained on
copyrighted work, effectively stealing the work of others to produce a worse product. The technology of AI relies on that theft to produce
its results. AI only threatens the livelihoods of the Am erican people.
