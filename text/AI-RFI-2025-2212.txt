General Comment
Dear Mr. President,
There is absolutely no reason to pursue this plan with AI. It is purely a speculative bubble with no actual value which is built off the backs
of copyright holders which have not been com pensated nor did these com panies receive consent from  them . Creatives within every
industry have categorical disagreem ents with AI com panies. The US public does not want AI shoved down their throats. If our tax dollars
aren't going to be used for things that m ake our country stronger or safer or better for the people who live in it, then surely this
adm inistration can find better things to use it on rather than AI that no one wants nor asked for.
