General Comment
As a current working m em ber of the US econom y based in California who has been researching generative AI and its effects on the
working class for the past few years, it is m y belief that generative AI and AI com panies alike need to be reigned in and forced to subm it
to restrictions in developm ent that fall under copyright law based under the stolen work in the datasets they used to train and build their
product(s). Allowing these com panies to continue with reckless abandonm ent could potentially destroy the future of the film  industry in
California, which contributes to so m uch of the US's GDP that if California were to becom e a sovereign nation our GDP would be in the
top five highest of the world. Destroying the em ploym ent of hundreds of thousands of workers in the arts for the sake of falsely prom ised
progress by these grifting AI com panies whose business m odel is built upon stolen data that was m ade BY SAID ARTISTS is cruel and
unusual punishm ent and should not be tolerated. If prom oting econom ic growth is the goal, the working class artists should be supported,
not these tech grifters m aking false prom ises with a faulty product built upon lies.
