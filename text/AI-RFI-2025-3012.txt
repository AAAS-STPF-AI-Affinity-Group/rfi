General Comment
Any AI Plan m ust take into account the source of the data used for training. It is of utm ost im portance that data m ust com e from  inform ed,
consenting parties - not just because of existing copyright law, but because artists and creators deserve the basic hum an decency of not
having their skills and craft stolen from  them  by com panies that would replace actual hum an art with soulless generated content for the
sake of profit.
