General Comment
Generative AI is theft. It steals from  working writers and artists to produce products of no value at all steep environm ental cost. The
purpose of AI is to put people out of work. The governm ent should regulate it into oblivion, not rem ove barriers that protect Am erican
jobs. Generative AI is a bubble, a fantasy dream ed up by illiterate scroungers who do not value skill, expertise, or the econom ic strength
that com es from  people being paid for their work. Say yes to artists; no to billionaires.
