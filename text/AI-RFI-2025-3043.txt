General Comment
This will be detrim ental to anybody that has a copyright of any kind. Copyright law will im m ediately becom e virtually m eaningless and
decim ate the work of billions of people. We cannot allow OpenAI to get this kind of im m unity. We have barely dealt with AI in a
m eaningful way. If OpenAI gets what it wants, we wonâ€™t be able to m eaningfully address the problem  for decades.
