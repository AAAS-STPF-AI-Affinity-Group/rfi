General Comment
For the love of god dont let Open AI steal from  talented people. With Open AI they can steal not just from  talented artists but they can
m ake unsavory content about people. If som eone that uses Open AI canâ€™t m ake art they can pick up a pencil and learn. Art is a skill that
should be m ade m y hum ans not m achines. Up with Artists, Down with AI
