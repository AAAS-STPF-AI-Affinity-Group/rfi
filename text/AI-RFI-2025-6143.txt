General Comment
Hi, I’m a production artist in the si gnage and brandi ng industry and AI is literally ruining the en vironment and my industry by using 
obscene  energy to generate incorrect information and the ugliest media I have ever seen in my lifetime. Literal s&^% sm eared on a 
wall is preferable  to looking at an ything AI generated. Please do not invest more ti me in plans for it, we want sol utions to real world 
problem s like the risi ng costs of groceries and healthcare access for all. Investment in AI is inhumane at th is point in time. Please 
focus on cari ng for the concerns  of living people.
Furthermore tra ining AI off the work o f peop le without their explicit consent is theft, pure and simple. So meone smarter t han me wrote ‘ if 
a human can’t be bot hered to make it why would I bot her to e ngage with it’ and that’s 100 % true. It’s not art, it’s bor ing unoriginal stolen 
SLOP a nd I’m sick of it. Please stop spe nding time on it. Thank you.
