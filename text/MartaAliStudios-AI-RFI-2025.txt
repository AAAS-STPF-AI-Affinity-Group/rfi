Greetings, 
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to provide input towards shaping the AI Action 
Plan to ensure that the United States of America continues to be a global leader in AI.  
As an innovative design and fabrication company working across the building and 
manufacturing sectors, we are focused on using AI to enhance productivity, 
streamline complex processes, and accelerate innovation . Through our initiative, 
“Designing the Future Now”, we have been also actively engaged in AI innovation, 
implementation and industry advocacy efforts at the local, national, and international 
levels. 
Based on our experience, we believe any successful AI strategy must move beyond 
broad national directives. Effective implementation starts at the local level—in 
neighborhoods, cities, and states—and should scale regionally and nationally. This kind 
of tiered approach ensures relevance, accessibility, and measurable outcomes, 
especially for industries and communities still navigating the value, application and 
effective implementation of AI. 
The following strategic recommendations reflect this view and are intended to support 
America’s leadership in AI while driving real impact across sectors.  
“AI Action Plan” Strategic Focus Areas 
1. Sectoral Transformation (Top Priority)●Develop AI Roadmaps by Sector: Provide clear guidance for industries such as
— building , manufacturing, infrastructure, healthcare, finance—on how to
integrate AI, with measurable outcomes and scalable solutions. For instance ;
○Modernize the Building Industry: Support AI adoption to reduce
regulatory bottlenecks, increase efficiency in design and
construction, reduce risk and liability, and enable smart and
sustainable development. Also , encourage adoption of emerging


technologies  like generative design, predictive analytics, and digital 
twins to help transform the sector forward more rapidly. 
○Advance Manufacturing with AI: Encourage the use of AI in advanced
manufacturing to enable faster product development, smart materials
innovation, and more optimised supply chains.●Close the Adoption Gap: Many industry professionals are still uncertain about
AI’s value or lack resources to adopt it effectively. Provide sector-specific
education, pilot programs, and hands-on support to address this gap.●Lead with Intention : Without clear national leadership, AI adoption risks being
uneven. A structured, intentional approach will ensure all sectors move forward
at a more progressive and uniform pace.
2. Education and Workforce
●AI Education at Every Level: Roll out AI education and awareness programs at
the local, city, state, regional, and national levels. Several communities also
need funding support to try out and implement AI since not all relevant AI tools
are accessible without hiking subscription fees.●Reskill and Upskill: Launch programs to help workers in fast-changing
industries gain AI-related skills, using AI itself to offer personalized learning
could be one option.●Focus on Critical Thinking : AI should be a tool to support—not replace—
critical thinking . Integrate problem-solving and creative reasoning into all AI
training.
●Equip Educators with the right AI tools: Provide training and resources to help
educators teach both technical and ethical dimensions of AI.
●Fellowship Programs: Create local, regional and national fellowship programs
to accelerate the development of AI talent and help shape leadership across
sectors.
3. Research & Development
●Invest in R&D: consider strong investment in AI research , especially in areas
like secure AI, generative models, and applications for sectors like
manufacturing , building and infrastructure sectors.
●AI Centers of Excellence: Create hubs that bring together researchers,
industry, and government to develop practical, high-impact AI solutions.
●Support Partnerships: Incentivize collaboration  between public and private
sectors to bring AI research to market.
4. Innovation and Competitiveness


●Support AI Startups: Offer grants, tax incentives, and regulatory support to
help AI startups grow, especially in underserved areas.
●Modernize Traditional Industries: Fund pilot programs to show how AI can
transform sectors like the building, manufacturing and infrastructure.
●Establish better Standards: Take the lead on global AI standards and ethics,
aligning with U.S. values.
In conclusion, in order for the U.S.A. to lead in AI, we need a clear, focused strategy  
that works at every level—from local communities to national policy—and across all 
sectors. AI adoption must be intentional, inclusive, practical and robust, supporting 
industries and empowering communities across the nation. 
We are also committed to contributing to this effort and helping drive meaningful, 
measurable outcomes as AI continues to shape the future of our nation through 
initiatives like “Designing the Future Now.”  
Thank you for your consideration! 
Sincerely,
