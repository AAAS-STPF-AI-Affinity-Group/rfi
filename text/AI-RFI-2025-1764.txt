General Comment
Please protect the rights of Am erican citizens, and do not allow these tech giants to infringe upon the copyright of independent creators.
AI com panies should be pouring research and developm ent into creating training m odels from  scratch. They want to m ake an easy buck
and use the works of others to skip this step, and to create a product that they can then sell for profit. If google and open ai gave access
to their m odels for free, that would be m ore fair. But open ai for exam ple is charging between $20-$200 for a m odel that they’ve trained
on copyrighted m aterial. There is no question that this is not theft. Please do not give these com panies special treatm ent and allow them  to
do som ething so unconstitutional. 
I am  soon to be a self-published, and to think after 6 years of hard work, on pouring out m y soul just to create the best work possible, it
m akes m e sick to think it will just be devoured by an ai. That’s not fair to anyone, and these corporations should not be given special
treatm ent to be allowed to do so. I beg that you please protect am ericas artists as this feels like a direct attack by tech com panies. Thank
you for your tim e and consideration.
