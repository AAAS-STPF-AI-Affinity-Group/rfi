Introduction  
Widespread access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools is rapidly transforming every economic 
sector, from agriculture and energy to healthcare and education. Wyoming has the opportunity to 
lead in AI innovation and application for rural areas, helping to better support the nearly one-
fifth of Americans who live in these areas and contribute 10 percent of the country’s gross 
domestic product. The persistence of the digital divide has shown that, without targeted rural -
focused AI programs, the next wave of technological advances will once again leave these 
communities behind. By prioritizing AI advancements that directly address rural challenges, 
Wyoming can play a key role in ensuring that AI -driven progress benefits all Americans, not just 
those in urban centers.  


2 Wyoming  is a rural state with a strong culture  of grit, innovation , and self-reliance . As a leading  
producer of coal, natural gas, oil and wind energy , the state plays a critical role in national 
energy security. Additionally , tourism and agriculture serve as important economic drivers and 
revenue producers , while healthcare and education are critical services that support all citizens  
and sustain rural communities . AI has the potential to drive growth in these key industries, while 
strengthening rural economies  and enhancing educational opportunities , and healthcare  services .  
The University of Wyoming (UW) , a land -grant instit ution, is the only 4-year university in 
Wyoming, with a mission that emphasizes teaching, research, and outreach. It provides 
accessible , affordable and high-quality  higher education; engages in research and creative 
activities that extend the frontiers of knowledge; and serves the people of Wyoming and beyond 
through engagement and outreach. The university ensures broad access to academic programs 
and lifelong learnin g and promotes economic development and cultural enrichment for Wyoming 
and the world . With state support, UW recently launched a comprehensive  AI Initiative  to 
prepare  for the growing influence of AI , with a  focus  on integrating AI into k ey industries such 
as agriculture, engineering, energy, tourism, wildlife conservation, and rural healthcare, ensuring 
that AI contributes to sustainable growth and enhances the quality of life in Wyoming.  The 
initiative building on UW investments in creating research centers in areas of importance for 
Wyoming, including Controlled Environment Agriculture, Wildlife and Technology, Quantum 
Information Science and Engineering, Rural Futures, and Energy Materials.  
Federal  and state AI policies must account for the unique challenges and opportunities in rural 
communities  to ensure that  rural states like Wyoming are not  left behind in the AI economy. 
Policies must also ensure that AI systems  do not  leave out  or disadvantage rural communities. 
Thoughtful i nvest ment  in AI for rural industries , rural healthcare  and rural education will 
strengthen our state workforce, support small businesses, and secure Wyoming’s role in the 
national AI landscape.  
This document outlines key AI policy priorities tailored to Wyoming’s and other rural regional 
needs, ensuring AI serves as a tool for student success, workforce readiness, and research 
innovation :  
1.Expanding rural AI education , workforce , and econ omic development ;
2.Enabling  and prioritizing AI applications in rural areas;
3.Strengthen  AI research and innovation  in rural areas ;
4.Building  energy -efficient  AI infrastructure  to serve the na tion; and
5.Encourage secure and tra nspar ent AI .
Under each of these priorities, we outline concrete steps that the federal government can take as 
part of an AI Action Plan to prevent  a future “AI Divide” and to ensure that AI tools are 
effectively leveraged for critical sectors predominantly centered in rural a reas (e.g., energy, 
extraction, tourism).  We advocate for continued investment in Big Ideas from Small Places, and 
we believe that this opportunity for visioning federal AI policy is an excellent opportunity to 
enact that.

in rural, remote, and under -resourced areas have access to the resources needed to
develop skills for a competitive workforce.
oExpand  AI education programs  in rural areas . Ensure the University of Wyoming and
its community college partners are prepar ing students for AI careers . Support  similar
rural institutions nationwide in providing the same opportunities as those in urban and
coastal areas .
oExpand  Pell Grant eligibility and workforce retraining funds  into AI-related
certificate programs that will  upskill rural workers.
oIncrease  funding from NSF and other agencies for AI education grants that target
rural states and communities, ensuring rural -serving universities like UW receive
direct support.

investing in applied research, preparing students and low -skilled workers for AI -driven careers  
and empowering rural communities to harness AI for economic growth, resilience, and long -term 
national competitiveness.  
Rural states  cannot afford to be left out of the AI revolution. By focusing on innovation, 
workforce development, and responsible governance, Wyoming can lead the way in AI while 
staying true to its core principles of education al excellence, economic opportunity, and rural self -
reliance.
