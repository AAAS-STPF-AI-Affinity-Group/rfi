General Comment
Hello,
As an artist and content creator I think it is im perative that the rights of artists, creators and individuals not be infringed upon by artificial
intelligence and its creators. I believe that ai should never be trained on m aterials which are not public dom ain, not up for free use, or not
otherwise available whether by volunteer or agreem ent to be used. Ai can be deceptive, easily exploit individuals or be used for other
harm  if trained in an unethical m anner. We, as hum an beings and citizens of the usa have a right to defend our individual rights, which
includes the right to our personal im age and the right to copyright our works of art. Thus, any plan or agenda m ade should respect
copyright and respect individual privacy (such as m aking it illegal to train ai on pictures of individuals or docum ents which could exploit an
individualâ€™s im age, rights, or other records). 
AI com panies have a right to hire workers who can write, code, create art, or create content to train their ai m odel with. Using
copyrighted or otherwise personal and private art is unethical, and unlawful, and should never be an option.
Thank you for a chance to post m y opinion.
