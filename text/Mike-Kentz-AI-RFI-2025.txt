To whom it may concern:
The government should fund a massive project for the development of AI literacy in
education. This project should not center only around the development of new platforms,models, and machine learning systems - but also a meaningful understanding of what it meansto use Large Language Models thoughtfully and creatively. We want citizens who are notblindly addicted to AI but use it wisely, creatively, and produce interesting content with it. Itdoesn't benefit anyone to have a nation of human drones that can't do anything by themselves.The way to navigate through that is to fund education projects inside and outside of schools.Education around prompting, machine learning, creative use cases, and reform for educationpractices is imperative.
AI literacy is, in my opinion, the most important skill that can and should be developed in
schools in 2025. But schools need funding to make that a reality, otherwise they will sit ontheir hands and not develop the skills in their faculty that are necessary to pass on to theirstudents.
