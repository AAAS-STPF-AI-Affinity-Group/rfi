General Comment
"OSTP seeks input on the highest priority policy actions that should be in the new AI Action Plan. "
The highest priority should be to SHUT THIS NONSENSE DOWN RIGHT THE EFF NOW. Any "business" that can't survive without
theft (of copyright) shouldn't exist.
Furtherm ore, none of this garbage works the way its proponents claim . It will never create any good art. It will never write engaging
prose. Actual hum ans can barely do those things and you expect a copy of a copy of a copy run through a blender to do it? No. Stop
trying to m ake "fetch" happen.
