General Comment
"AI" is a sham  and a gim m ick that steals from  writers and artists and requires an obscene am ount of resources that are doing real dam age
to our planet. Any potential benefits from  generative AI (outside lim ited applications in data research and m edical spaces) is not worth the
irreparable harm  it causes to people's livelihoods and the environm ent. If som ething sounds too good to be true, it probably is, and the fact
that it is being FORCED on us by m ajor corporations and data com panies -- who historically do nor have the best interests of consum ers
and the world in m ind -- tells us this is not worth investing in. They only care about getting as m uch content as they can as cheaply as
possible, and lining their own pockets.
