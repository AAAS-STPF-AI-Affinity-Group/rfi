General Comment
Technology addiction is an addiction that is destroying our youth. This addiction has snowballed with advancem ents in AI that can predict
what the user wants that they didn't even know they wanted. TikTok's algorithm  is a great exam ple of this. Every single person who attains
an ID in this country needs to give up their finger print. This finger print goes into a digital database. All m odern phones have fingerprint
scanners. Give Meta and other com panies access to the fingerprint database. Match the person's fingerprint when they sign up for
Instagram . Then check their birthdate against that database lookup. If they are old enough, let them  m ake the account. Lock that person's
identity to the account. That is the easiest way to verify a person's age so they can m ake an account, I can think of.
