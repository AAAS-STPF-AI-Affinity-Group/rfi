General Comment
This bill will irreparably harm  creatives by allowing AI to train on their m aterial, and reproduce it, without giving anything to the creative in
return. Copyright has long been used to guarantee that those that have m ade som ething retain the rights to it so that they can m ake a living
with it. Letting AI use such m aterial without paying for it, sim ply because they want to, is the opposite of what m akes capitalism  work.
Those that do the work should be paid *fairly* for their work.
