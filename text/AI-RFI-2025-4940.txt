General Comment
I work in the film  industry. AI has been trained off the labor of writers, artists, and craftspeople, and on copyrighted works. It will take
m illions of jobs away from  workers in every creative industry. These workers deserve to profit off their own work and craft they've spent
years honing. We need strong guardrails so that AI is only used as a tool by hum ans and not to replace them . Innovation of generative AI
has already com e as a direct result of copyright theft. We cannot allow the private sector to continue stealing work unchecked and with no
com pensation to the creators of the work on which AI is trained.
