General Comment
It is im perative our governm ent protect our property--the property of m illions of hardworking Am ericans who write, draw, and create,
fueling so m any vital Am erican industries. Why should one group of com panies get to steal from  others, without gaining consent or paying
for use of our property, and breaking IP and copyright law? That's sim ply not fair. Please ensure the future prosperity of all Am ericans
and creatives. Your first priority MUST be using whatever is developed ethically and sustainably, to m ake it som ething that can be legally
used. You cannot sim ply bulldoze laws you find inconvenient that exist to protect others' rights and property, and steal whatever you like.
