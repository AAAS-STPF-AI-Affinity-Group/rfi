General Comment
Copyrighted m aterials used for training AI should be subject to royalties. Royalties are already applied to stream ed copyrighted m aterials.
It is reasonable to expect that the weighted trained value that results from  deep or reinforcem ent learning on copyrighted m aterial can
sim ilarly have a value assigned to it. Com putation of these values is itself im plied by the large processing capacity of the m ethods
them selves.
