MANA GING THE LABOR  TRANSITION TO POST AGI ECONOMICS  
This document assumes that A rtificial Intelligence systems will reach at some point over the 
next 5 years a certain threshold qualified as Radical Transformative AI (RTAI), Powerful AI 
(per Anthropic’s Amodei) or AGI. It contains no critical discussion of the “threshold” AI 
concept i tself.  
I. Government, Technologies, and Technological Transitions
The remarkable success of generative AI and the rapid acceleration toward artificial general 
intelligence (AGI) have fueled debates on their profound economic and societal impacts. Unlike 
previous technological revolutions, AGI will introduce a fundamental  restructuring of labor 
markets, corporate power, and the role of the Government . 
History provides valuable lessons: technological progress often results in creative destruction, 
displacing established industries while giving rise to new sectors. However, the scale and 
speed of AGI deployment demand a more proactive approach than historical laissez -faire 
adaptations.  Policymakers must anticipate structural economic transformations , ensure the 
continuity of innovation, and safeguard societal cohesion  while maintaining economic 
dynamism.  
Key considerations include:  
•Historical precedents:  From the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age,
technological transitions have been accompanied by new opportunities, but also labor
displacement, social unrest, and new economic paradigms. The shift toward post -labor
economics will likely follow a similar trajectory but on an exponentially accelerated
timeline.
•Government’s role in economic transitions:  While market mechanisms efficiently
allocate resources, periods of intense technological shifts require public -private
coordination  to mitigate social and economic dislocations.
•Corporate concentration and market structure:  Unlike previous revolutions, AI and
AGI development is highly concentrated within a few firms , raising concerns about
economic centralization, monopolistic power, and systemic risks.
•Education and workforce preparation:  Current educational paradigms  remain
largely structured around industrial -era employment models. The transition to post -AGI


2 economics requires a radical overhaul of workforce development and lifelong learning 
systems.  
II. Phases of Tech -Driven Economic and Labor Transitions
Economic transitions driven by automation and  technological changes  such as General Purpose 
Technologies ( “platform ” technologies for a n ew industrial revolution, such as in the past the 
steam engine, electricity  and integrated circuits)  follow predictable phases of social and 
economic adaptation . The consen sus among economists is that these phases will be similar 
for AI , only occurring much faster  as we present in this timeline : 
1.Displacement and Shock (Short -Term, 0 -1.5 Years)
oRapid automation of knowledge work and routine non-physical  tasks  (deep
research agents, operators) .
oExistential questioning  among mid -skill workers and white -collar professionals.
oIncreased corporate profits and declining labor income share.
oPsychological resistance and denial among affected workers.
2.Reconfiguration (Mid -Term, 2-3 Years)
oLabor markets begin rapidly adjusting  after the announcement of RTAI .
oCorporations struggle with the new narrative control  over automation’s impact.
oPublic skepticism toward AGI -driven economic models increases.
oGeopolitical realignments emerge as nations adapt at different paces.
3.New Economic Structures ( 3-4 Years )
oEmergence of new economic paradigms  beyond traditional employment
structures.
oIncreased economic agency through personalized knowledge production ( i.e
content economy  and AI -driven entrepreneurship).
oGovernments gradually shift from traditional wage -based taxation to alternative
fiscal mechanisms.
oSocial redefinition of work and value  in the longer term .
III. Recommendations and Narratives for the Government
In navigating this transition, governments must assume a proactive role  in structuring policy 
and fostering innovation, avoiding a purely reactionary stance. The following recommendations 
outline a structured response framework:  
1. Institutional Adaptation and Economic Policy Reforms
•Ending Taxation of Labor  and taxing AI Productivity Gains:  Current tax systems
are based on labor income. Shifting towards a taxation model that captures value from
AI-driven economic activity  will be necessary  (tariffs, digital transactions tax, AI
agents ownership fees) .
•Creating New Economic Safety Nets:  Rather than universal cash transfers, structured
AI-driven social services  (e.g., automated skill -matching, adaptive learning


3 programs, and personalized economic opportunities ) should be developed.  We need 
to establish a real -time, nation -wide economic database of workers occupations, in order 
to provide rapid upskilling and match workers with corporations needs and training 
solutions.  
•Regulatory Guardrails for AI -driven Consolidation: Address monopolization concerns
by promoting AI decentralization and preventing extreme economic concentration.
2. Workforce Development for an AI -Dominated Economy
•Personalized and Continuous Education Models:  Traditional schooling must evolve
into adaptive, AI -driven educational ecosystems  tailored to individual cognitive and
technical skills.  Universities should all be mandated to have extension schools and we
should stop all incentives that currently encourage students to spend several years
dedicated to their initial education.
•Incentivizing Human -AI Collaboration:  Rather than merely replacing workers,
policies should incentivize businesses to integrate AI in ways that enhance human
productivity .
•Work Beyond Traditional Employment:  Future economic participation will depend
on fostering entrepreneurial mindsets and alternative economic structures  rather
than merely preserving outdated job categories.  We should provide new incentives to
LLC owners, securities owners and token owners and other venues to create wealth and
revenues beyond labor.
3. Rethinking Economic Agency
•Cultural and Narrative Framing:  The transition must be framed not as job transition ,
but as a shift toward economic empowerment, creativity, and personal fulfillment.
•Democratizing AI Ownership: Broad -based participation in AI -driven wealth creation
must be prioritized over mere redistribution , by promoting the use of tokens and digital
assets related to AI agents and the future AI -driven economy .
Conclusion  
The transition to post -AGI economics presents both existential risks and unprecedented 
opportunities.  Governments cannot afford to adopt a passive stance. The policies enacted 
today will shape the trajectory of AI -driven economic transformation for decades.  By 
focusing on institutional resilience, economic reconfiguration, and proactive technological 
governance,  we can ensure a future where AGI augments human potential rather than rendering 
it obsolete.
