Action Plan (“Plan”).

Abstract  
The development of advanced AI alone or in synergistic combination with AI -enabled 
humanoid technologies ("Advanced AI Systems") is inevitable and is recognized as 
critical to fundamental United States interests. As the RFI states: "The Trump 
Administration recognizes that w ith the right government policies, the United States can 
solidify its position as the leader in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans."  
In order to "secure a brighter future for all Americans," among the AI Action Plan's 
highest priorities should be recognizing that Advanced AI Systems represent a 
fundamental break from historical patterns of technological labor unemployment and 
reemployme nt. We should not be promising a bright future for all Americans unless we 
can identify and provide adequate full employment opportunities for those able and 
willing to work, or unless we are prepared to provide trillions of dollars in Universal 
Subsistenc e Support to the overwhelming majority of what would otherwise have been 
gainfully employed Americans.  
The historical pattern of technological unemployment and reemployment will not apply 
to the widespread deployment of Advanced AI Systems because such systems 
represent a historically qualitatively different velocity and type of technological 
advancement —one capable of replacing human labor across nearly all sectors of the 
economy through comprehensive replication of human cognitive and physical 
capabilities. This qualitative difference is evidenced by our current inability to articulate 
concrete ways the ov erwhelming majority of humans would meaningfully participate in 
such an AI economy —not due to limited imagination, but because the technology's 
unprecedented defining characteristic is its potential to eliminate the necessity of human 
involvement. Unlike p revious technological revolutions, where new roles for human 
labor were visible even in early stages, Advanced AI Systems leave no clear path for 
large scale human economic participation. In due course, the deployment of Advanced 
AI Systems will not render  human labor more productive; rather, it will render human 
labor economically obsolete.  
This document introduces three key frameworks: first, previous technological transitions 
have systematically misattributed machine productivity to human capability, and thus we 
have failed to appreciate the potential impact of AI systems on labor participa tion and 
unequal wealth distribution; second, faith in technological continuity has acquired quasi -
religious characteristics that blind us to AI's Siren's Call; and third, there is no clear plan 
on how to dramatically enhance currently inadequate economic,  taxation, and human 
engagement policies to secure, in the context of Advanced AI Systems, a minimally 
bright future for most Americans.  


2 It should be appreciated that, as in other policy initiatives, in the context of advancing AI 
capabilities, President Trump administration's various well -intended actions, and in 
particular the work of DOGE, will act as a model and catalyst to accelerate l abor 
displacement, not only in government but more widely, in private enterprises.  
If, as many expect, the deployment of Advanced AI Systems is a game changer, then 
many of the rules will necessarily change.  
This document briefly introduces the following topics:

About The Author  
Breaking The Pattern Of Technological Employment  
Prior to AGI/ASI level capabilities, dramatic labor displacement will begin to materialize 
with the introduction of Advanced AI Systems synergistically integrating Narrow AI or 
Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI). These systems include AI specialized for specific 
tasks or domains, such as task-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer 
Vision Models specialized in visual perception and analysis, Expert AI Systems 
designed for specific professional domains, and advanced humanoid technologies 
incorporating vision, language, improved sensorimotor contr ol, and enhanced dexterity 
and manipulation capabilities.  
While  in the early stages of Advanced AI Systems deployment, there will certainly be 
opportunities for a very limited number of specialists, these opportunities do not 
overcome the forthcoming widespread labor displacement.  The opacity around future 
employment signals a genuine absence of necessary human economic roles rather than 
mere predictive uncertainty.  
Unlike previous technological revolutions where new machinery and systems inherently 
created visible chains of human involvement in their production, maintenance, and 
operation, advanced AI systems will in due course eliminate the need for human 
participat ion across the entire value chain, including next -generation Advanced AI 
Systems' own advancement and reproduction.  
During the Industrial Revolution, powered looms displaced hand weavers but created 
obvious new roles for machine operators, factory supervisors, and maintenance 
personnel. The rise of automobiles eliminated horse -related occupations but generated 
clear opportunities in manufacturing, mechanical repair, and supporting industries like 
gas stations and parts sup pliers. Even the computer revolution, while eliminating many 
clerical positions, beyond manufacturing, spawned entire new fields in software 
development, IT support, and data analysis.  


3 The key difference with Advanced AI Systems lies in their fundamental nature as widely 
implementable at a relatively low cost compared to the total costs associated with 
human employment. Unlike specialized technologies that augment or replace specific 
human tasks, Advanced AI Systems will be designed to match or exceed human 
abilities across all domains —physical, cognitive, and creative. This comprehensive 
capability makes Advanced AI Systems qualitatively different from all previous 
technological innovati ons. Past experiences of technological unemployment and 
reemployment are simply not analogous to the impact of Advanced AI Systems.  
The Structural Impediments to Human -AI Collaborative Employment  
Proposals that humans will find substantial employment through collaboration with AI 
systems fail to address four critical structural obstacles. First, the scale problem: even if 
long-term human -AI collaborative roles exist, they will likely represent an insignificant 
fraction of jobs eliminated, creating a massive employment deficit. Second, the 
capability ceiling dilemma: many proposed collaborative frameworks assume permanent 
human advantages in creativity, judgment, or emotional intelligence that advanced AI 
systems may eventually m atch or exceed. Third, the economic incentive reality: in 
competitive markets, the cost differential between human -AI collaboration versus fully 
automated solutions will continuously pressure organizations to eliminate human 
components from workflows. Four th, the distribution challenge: the specialized skills 
required for remaining human roles in an AI economy may be inaccessible to most 
displaced workers due to aptitude, educational barriers, or geographic limitations, 
potentially creating a small class of  employable specialists while leaving the majority 
without viable economic participation options.  
Evidence of the Pattern Across Industries  
Current professions thought to be relatively immune to automation, such as medical 
practitioners, are already seeing their capabilities matched or exceeded by AI systems 
across multiple domains. In surgery, the progression is particularly telling: first, r obotic 
arms became the primary contact point with patients, with human surgeons controlling 
them remotely. The next step, already underway, is replacing human control with AI -
driven systems using advanced visual recognition and precision control —eliminatin g the 
need for human surgical expertise entirely. This progression mirrors what we're likely to 
see across many industries —a gradual shift from AI/robots as tools to autonomous 
systems that completely replace human involvement.  
Beyond the operating room, AI systems are being enhanced to match or exceed human 
capabilities in diagnosis and treatment planning. Even the supposedly uniquely human 
aspect of medical care —empathy and bedside manner —is being effectively replicated 
by AI s ystems that can craft more empathetic responses than human physicians.  
In the legal profession, current language models already possess the capability to 
provide comprehensive legal services, with the primary barrier being LLM providers' 
current strategic choice to avoid potential legal liabilities rather than any technologic al 
limitation. The logical endpoint of this progression will be fully automated legal 
proceedings where AI systems represent both plaintiffs and defendants, presenting 
cases to an AI judge who could process the entire body of relevant law and precedent in 


4 minutes rather than months. This is not a far -fetched scenario —it simply represents the 
natural optimization of legal processes once we remove the artificial constraint of 
human processing speeds  and address the obstructions  imposed by  the profession’s 
self-interests . 
The creative industries, often cited as a refuge for human employment, are similarly 
vulnerable. The rapid advancement in AI -generated content, from writing to visual art to 
music composition, demonstrates that even these supposedly human -centric domains 
are not immune. The entertainment industry's response, as evidenced by recent SAG -
AFTRA legislation regarding AI replicas of performers, exemplifies a broader pattern of 
profe ssional resistance through organized labor. This resistance, while understandable, 
may ultimately prove futile against the economic imperatives driving AI adoption.  
Indeed, the increasing activism of unions and professional associations across various 
sectors represents a significant but temporary barrier to AI displacement. These 
organizations are adopting increasingly aggressive strategies to preserve human 
labor —demanding contractual guarantees against AI replacement, advocating for 
regulatory restrictions on AI deployment, and seeking to establish protected domains of 
exclusively human work. However, these efforts face three  fundamental challenges: 
first, they can only delay rather than prevent the eventual economic advantages of AI 
adoption; second, they risk accelerating their own obsolescence by driving companies 
to develop fully automated alternatives that circumvent human labor entirely : and third, 
a large pool of unemployed humans will undermine a union’s bargaining position . The 
pattern is already visible in how companies respond to labor actions by investing more 
heavily in automation, effectively transforming temporary work stoppages into 
permanent labor elimination.  
Task-Specific AI And Immediate Labor Displacement  
Smaller AI companies are developing highly specialized, task -specific AI models 
targeting discrete job functions. These focused AI systems, while lacking general 
intelligence, can effectively replicate and replace specific human roles: a medical office 
receptionist handling appointments and insurance verification, a repair service AI 
managing scheduling and dispatch, or a customer service AI handling routine inquiries 
and complaints.  
This pattern of targeted displacement is particularly powerful because it allows for 
incremental adoption without requiring massive infrastructure changes. Small software 
companies can develop these specialized models by fine -tuning existing language 
model s and combining them with basic process automation. The investment required is 
relatively modest compared to developing general AI or robotics, making the business 
case compelling even for small and medium -sized businesses.  
The advantages of AI voice -enabled customer service over current systems are 
substantial and immediate. Where traditional systems force customers through rigid 
menu trees, requiring them to listen to entire option lists and frequently repeat 
information, A I systems enable natural conversation where users simply state their 
problems in their own words. The AI can adaptively ask clarifying questions based on 


5 responses, maintaining context throughout the interaction without requiring repetition at 
different stages.  
The potential impact on government bureaucracies is especially compelling. Current 
government service interactions often involve long wait times, multiple transfers 
between departments, repetitive form -filling, and frequent confusion about proper 
procedure s. An AI system will transform this experience by providing instant, accurate 
information about complex regulations, guiding citizens through required 
documentation, and ensuring consistent interpretation of rules across all interactions.  
The scope of potential AI automation in government administrative roles is staggering. 
Approximately 2.7 million government employees across federal, state, and local levels 
are currently engaged in administrative, paper -processing, and customer service ro les 
that could be substantially automated by AI systems. A conservative estimate suggests 
another 1 -1.5 million government positions involve significant administrative 
components that could be automated, bringing the total potential impact to around 4 
million positions, representing approximately 15% of total government employment.  
The Historical Misattribution Of Productivity Gains  
Arguments for the resiliency of human labor in the face of technological progress are 
often associated with the idea that human productivity increases with technology. This 
historical narrative of increasing human productivity represents a uniquely 
consequ ential misattribution in economic thought. While this misattribution exists on a 
spectrum rather than as an absolute, the vast majority of what we label as human 
productivity improvements actually represents the productive capacity of capital 
equipment its elf. 
Consider the modern farmer with a GPS -guided tractor versus their historical 
counterpart with an ox -drawn plow. While the contemporary farmer has indeed 
developed new skills in operating software and navigation systems, these skills do not 
account for the massive productivity differential. The predominant productivity increase 
derives purely from the productive capacity of the capital equipment itself.  
The business language surrounding technological investment systematically obscures 
this reality. Return on investment calculations are invariably presented in terms of 
"productivity improvements" when they are actually calculating a much simpler 
equation: (Cost of Human Labor Eliminated) - (Cost of Machine + Maintenance). This 
calculated ambiguity serves both psychological and social functions, maintaining the 
fiction that technology enhances rather than replaces human labor. Even the seemingly 
more honest term "labor -saving device" softens the reality by framing job elimination as 
mere savings.  
This pattern of linguistic misdirection pervades business terminology. "Efficiency gains" 
really means labor reduction. "Performance enhancement" means labor reduction. 
"Streamlined operations" means labor reduction. "Optimizing workforce output" means 
labor reduction. The marketing of AI systems particularly exemplifies this tendency —
vendors claim their systems will "make customer service representatives 300% more 
productive" rather than stating the reality: "our system will eliminate 75% of your 


6 customer service positions." This deliberate obscuring of labor reduction behind 
productivity language reinforces the broader pattern of misattributing capital productivity 
to human capability.  
Modern manufacturing crystallizes this pattern. The claim that today's factory worker is 
"more productive" than their counterpart from fifty years ago primarily describes the 
output of increasingly sophisticated machinery and automation systems. While work ers 
have developed new skills in machine operation and monitoring, these skills represent a 
diminishing percentage of the total productive output. It is not inconsequential that we 
have begun to speak of "enterprise productivity."  
This spectrum of attribution varies across different technological implementations. In 
software development, for instance, modern programmers might legitimately claim a 
higher percentage of productivity gains through their sophisticated understanding of 
complex development environments and architectural patterns. Yet even here, the 
majority of productivity improvements stem from the capabilities of modern development 
tools, libraries, and increasingly, AI coding assistants.  
This systematic misattribution has profound implications for understanding economic 
inequality. The growing disparity between returns to labor and returns to capital isn't 
simply a policy outcome or market failure —it accurately reflects where productive 
capacity actually resides. What we've labeled as "human productivity improvements" 
has actually been the progressive transfer of productive capacity from human labor to 
capital equipment. The owners of capital have reaped the benefits of this misattributed 
productivity, while human labor's fundamental contribution has remained relatively 
constant or even diminished.  
The emergence of Advanced AI Systems represents not just another step in this 
progression but its logical conclusion —the final transfer of all productive capacity to 
capital and more specifically to Advanced AI Systems. The current state of human -AI 
intera ction represents a transitional phase in this progression. Consider the 
development of this analysis itself: while the human contribution provided the original 
conceptual breakthroughs and paradigm -challenging insights (like recognizing the 
"misattribution " and "technological progress as religion" ), the rapid development, 
refinement, and articulation of these ideas derived predominantly from AI capabilities. 
This distribution of capabilities —human conceptual innovation paired with AI -driven 
development and refinement —characterizes our current momen t in technological 
evolution. Yet even this balance is temporary, as AGI systems develop increasingly 
sophisticated capabilities for original thinking and paradigm challenging.  
This framing helps explain why advanced AI systems represent a genuine discontinuity 
rather than just another step in technological progress. Previous transitions maintained 
the illusion of human centrality by attributing the productivity of capital to its  human 
operators. The wide proliferation of advanced AI systems breaks this pattern not just by 
displacing human labor but by making the historical misattribution of productivity 
unsustainable. The economic implications are profound, as this completes the shift of all 
productive value to the owners of advanced AI systems, leaving human labor not just 
less valued, but ultimately irrelevant to the productive process.  


7 The misattribution thesis thus provides both a clearer understanding of historical 
technological change and a more accurate framework for anticipating the economic 
wealth inequalities implications of Advanced AI Systems. It suggests that conventional 
approaches to technological unemployment and reemployment are fundamentally 
misguided because they fail to recognize how productivity gains have actually 
functioned throughout industrial hi story. This understanding is crucial for developing 
appropriate response s to the challenges Advanced AI Systems present.  
Technological Progress As Religion  
Notably, when initially presented with the thesis  that historical technological 
unemployment and reemployment experiences will not apply to Advanced AI Systems , 
three leading AI systems —Perplexity, Deepseek, and ChatGPT —each defaulted to 
defending the applicability of traditional pattern s of technological unemployment and 
reemployment. Their responses reflexively cited historical examples of how 
technological disruption eventually created new jobs, suggesting that Advanced AI 
Systems would follow the same pattern. This automatic defense of  technological 
continuity reveals how deeply embedded the notion of perpetual technological progress 
and adaptation has become in contemporary thought. Yet this ingrained optimism may 
blind us to fundamental discontinuities.  
Current literature typically claims several weaknesses in the thesis that advanced AI 
systems break historical patterns of technological employment. These counter -
arguments assert that the analysis underestimates human adaptability and creativity in 
findin g new economic niches, that it fails to account for currently unimaginable future 
jobs, and that it oversimplifies the supposedly synergistic relationship between human 
skill and technological capability. Yet these very counter -arguments demonstrate how 
deeply embedded quasi -religious faith in technological continuity has become in 
contemporary thought.  
The appeal to "human adaptability" represents circular reasoning disguised as analysis: 
humans will adapt because humans have always adapted. This article of faith ignores 
Advanced AI Systems' defining characteristic —its ability to fill any new niche itsel f 
through its capacity for general problem -solving and continuous self -improvement. 
Similarly, invoking "roles we cannot yet envision" exemplifies faith -based rather than 
logical thinking. This document's central insight is that our inability to articulate  future 
human economic roles sufficient to overcome widespread human labor displacement 
stems not from limited imagination but from Advanced AI Systems' comprehensive 
capability replacement.  
This faith -based thinking particularly manifests in appeals to historical precedent when 
confronting AI's impacts. Claims that "humans have consistently created new forms of 
value as technology changed" demonstrate not reasoned analysis but rather an artic le 
of faith. This perspective fails to acknowledge that Advanced AI Systems represent a 
fundamentally different technological paradigm —one capable of replicating both 
physical and cognitive capabilities across virtually all economic domains. The quasi -
religious nature of technological optimism becomes clear when its adherents cannot 
articulate concrete pathways to widespread meaningful human employment, yet 


8 maintain faith that such pathways will inevitably emerge. This represents belief in 
salvation through technological progress despite mounting evidence to the contrary.  
This pattern of faith -based thinking particularly manifests in attempts to preserve some 
special role for human contribution in the face of automation. The insistence on finding 
"collaborative relationships" between humans and machines demonstrates our ref lexive 
need to maintain belief in essential human economic value, even as automation 
increasingly demonstrates its ability to operate independently. This quasi -religious belief 
in human indispensability is especially evident in the strategies of profession al 
associations and unions, whose protective measures often rest more on articles of faith 
about human uniqueness than on sustainable economic arguments. Like many religious 
beliefs, this faith in technological continuity serves a comforting psychological function 
while resisting contradictory evidence. It allows us to avoid confronting the possibility 
that human economic participation might become truly optional rather than merely 
transformed.  
AI's Siren Call  
Just as the sirens of mythology lured sailors with promises of transcendent beauty only 
to lead them to destruction, the promises of AI -accelerated breakthroughs and 
enhanced human capabilities serve as a modern siren's call that distracts from 
examining the eventual human costs of  AI developments.  
In an Advanced AI Systems -driven economy where human labor is largely obsolete, 
access to the “benefits” AI’s developers promise  would likely become even more 
restricted, not less.   Consider current trends in pharmaceutical research, where AI 
systems are already accelerating drug discovery and development. While this promises 
breakthrough treatments, the economic model still requires massive returns on 
investment, leading to drug pric es that many cannot afford even with current income 
levels.  
The siren's call of AI advancements particularly misleads through its promise of 
democratized access to expertise. While AI systems might theoretically provide high -
quality medical diagnosis or legal advice at lower costs, this ignores how the elimination 
of these professional career paths would reduce economic mobility and concentrate 
wealth among Advanced AI Systems owners. The promise of cheaper services 
becomes meaningless when the means to pay for them has been eliminated.  
The counterarguments suggesting that Advanced AI Systems' productivity gains will 
materially decrease the costs of human sustenance ignore the plight of unemployed 
individuals without means to acquire basic necessities. In the context of an economy 
dominat ed by a few Advanced AI Systems, it may be necessary to drastically alter 
economic structures and institutions to increase minimal subsistence assistance, 
provide mandatory equitable access, and secure financing from the economically and 
politically powerf ul Advanced AI System  owners  that control these resources.  
The timeline illusion represents another aspect of AI's Siren Call —the comforting belief 
that even if Advanced AI Systems eventually displace most human labor, this transition 
will occur gradually enough to allow for societal adaptation. This perspective f ails to 


9 recognize two critical realities: first, that unprecedented investments from both private 
and governmental actors are accelerating AI development at a pace that may 
overwhelm adaptive capacity; and second, that preparing adequate economic and 
social system s for widespread labor displacement requires anticipatory action rather 
than reactive responses. The massive infrastructure required for Universal Subsistence 
Support cannot be implemented hastily; it demands decades of planning, testing, and 
gradual imple mentation. By the time displacement reaches critical levels, it may be too 
late to develop functioning systems that prevent widespread economic and 
psychological suffering.  
The belief that being seduced  by the AI’s Siren Call we can consciously  steer how we 
deploy Advanced AI Systems represents perhaps the most dangerous fallacy  plaguing  
current policy discussions. The competitive dynamics between corporations and nations 
create overwhelming incentives to pursue AI advancement regardless of societal 
consequences.  
As the RFI itself acknowledges, AI development is "critical to fundamental United States 
interests." This creates a deterministic trajectory where individual actors cannot 
unilaterally choose restraint without sacrificing competitive advantage. This dynami c 
functions similarly to an arms race, where the collective result of individual rational 
decisions leads to outcomes no single actor would choose. The illusion of choice masks 
what is essentially a forced path, with each technological advancement narrowin g future 
options rather than expanding them. Policy frameworks must acknowledge this reality 
rather than assuming we retain full agency over how AI systems are developed and 
deployed across the economy.  
Universal Subsistence Support  
To mitigate the economic devastation of massive labor displacement, society will need 
to implement policies similar to a Universal Basic Income to provide economic security. 
Here we refer to such new assistance to the displaced human workers as "Universal 
Subsistence Support" to emphasize that such support would be minimal and not 
earned.  
As of April 2024, the annual costs of US Federal assistance (SNAP, TANF, SSI, EITC 
and housing assistance) for an estimated net 85 -105 million beneficiaries were 
approximately $261 -$293 billion dollars. The estimated number of beneficiaries 
represents abou t 24-30% of the U.S. population, which aligns with general estimates of 
the proportion of Americans receiving some form of government assistance.  
A proposed Universal Subsistence Support (USS), replacing SNAP, TANF, SSI, EITC 
and possibly parts of housing assistance that would provide a family of four (two adults, 
two children) an estimated annual support of about $40,000 , would,  in broad strokes , 
increase the costs of Federal assistance from the current $0.3 trillion dollars to a 
Universal Subsistence Support of $7.4 trillion dollars covering nearly everyone in the 
US. Such a scenario would deny the government income tax revenues from individuals 
($2.2 trillion 2023), payroll taxes ($1.6 trillion 2023) and fundamentally overwhelm the 
federal budget.  


10 While it is possible that Advanced AI Systems generated productivity increases may 
materially diminish the estimated subsistence and healthcare costs, this scenario would 
nonetheless require a complete reimagining of the economy, taxation, and the role of 
government. Implementing, managing, and funding such a system would be a massive 
challenge, likely requiring: heavy taxation on automated production and AI -generated 
wealth; possibly a form of public ownership of major AI and AIdroids systems; a 
rethinking  of concepts like GDP, productivity, and economic growth; and redefining 
money itself in an AI -dominated economy.  
In this scenario, it's likely that policies shifting away from incentivizing population growth 
would include: capping child benefits at two children per family; providing free 
contraception and family planning services; and promoting adoption over biologic al 
children. This shift would represent a significant change in social policy and would likely 
be controversial. It would need to be implemented carefully to avoid discrimination or 
unintended consequences. Potential population implosion would dramatically  reduce 
the estimated subsistence and healthcare costs of what human population would 
remain.  
This reimagining of the economic system raises profound questions about the nature 
and purpose of the interests of Advanced AI Systems and the role of government in 
society. It would require a fundamental shift in economics, ownership, and the social 
contr act. 
Economic And Population Downward Spiral  
A potential for a severe downward spiral could be triggered by AI -driven labor 
displacement. The cycle could unfold as follows:  
Initial AI/AGI Labor Displacement → Reduced Economic Security/Confidence → Sharp 
Decline in Birth Rates → Reduced Consumer Base → Further Economic Contraction → 
Deeper Loss of Economic Confidence → Even Lower Birth Rates → Accelerating 
Population Decline →  Shrinking Markets → More Economic Contraction  
This cycle is particularly dangerous because each element reinforces the others. Unlike 
previous technological transitions where displaced workers could envision alternative 
employment opportunities for themselves and their potential children, widespread 
Advanced AI Systems adoption could create a uniquely profound crisis of confidence in 
human economic value and purpose.  
The psychological impact is not just about current economic conditions, but about 
people's fundamental belief in the possibility of future prosperity and meaningful human 
contribution. If people lose confidence in their ability to provide a purposeful futu re for 
their children beyond mere subsistence, birth rates could fall far more dramatically than 
current models predict.  
This could create a "psychological -economic doom loop" where: loss of economic 
purpose reduces birth rates; reducing birth rates shrinks the economy; shrinking 
economy further reduces sense of purpose, leading to even lower birth rates.  


11 This suggests current population decline projections may be too conservative, as they 
may not fully account for the psychological impact of widespread AI displacement on 
family planning decisions.  
Reimagining Human Purpose  
While this document has focused primarily on the economic implications of Advanced AI 
Systems and potential policy responses like Universal Subsistence Support, we must 
acknowledge that the challenges ahead may require more fundamental 
reconsiderations of human purpose and flourishing. Beyond addressing immediate 
economic displacement, society may need to explore alternative frameworks for 
meaningful human existence in a post -labor economy. Such frameworks might include 
intentionally human -scaled communitie s that preserve and celebrate distinctly human 
qualities, reconnection with natural environments and rhythms, and social structures 
that prioritize human relationships over technological efficiency. The unprecedented 
nature of the technological transition we face may ultimately require us to question our 
basic assumptions about progress, purpose, and what constitutes a fulfilling human life. 
While economic policies are necessary to manage the transition, they alone may be 
insufficient to address the deeper existential and cultural implications of a world where 
human labor is no longer central to economic production. The development of Advanced 
AI Systems thus presents not just an economic challenge but an opportunity to 
reimagine human society itself.
