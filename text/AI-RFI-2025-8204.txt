General Comment
Generative AI steals from  hum ans - if any real person were to break copyright law, they would be held accountable. A com puter cannot
be held accountable, so why should it be allowed to steal>
AI will destroy the livelihoods of m any with job layoffs because "a com puter can do it." AI also will destroy the planet with its water and
energy use. It has no place anywhere, let alone in governm ent.
