General Comment
The technology is run entirely on inform ation stolen without consent, with attem pts to skirt privacy laws and to avoid paying artists,
writers, and program m ers. Generative AI needs to be built with consent, full transparency, and without com prom ising others personal
inform ation. It is another industry built on stolen content, with no way to filter copyrighted assets and concepts or protect creators. Do not
allow it.
