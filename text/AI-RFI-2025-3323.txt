General Comment
Autom ated assem bly and basic, repetitive ideas are things com puters can do. Taking away jobs that require actual critical thinking and
intelligence, and replacing them  with m achine learning that lacks the context and depth to perform  will kill people. 
People will die, and resources will be spent to try and prove how "good" AI is while people die. 
Do not do this, unless you are m aking a plan to prevent m achine intelligence from  eventually taking over our entire society.
If we only valued people for output - like a com puter m ight - we would have no Mozart.
