The use of “Artificial Intelligence” (AI, LLM, etc.) will increase errors in evaluations, impede 
and destroy processes, and decimate the federal government. Evidence of AI’s failure is being reported everywhere so either this administration is too foolish or in denial about the harms such tools pose to complex government processes. Every evaluation of federal agencies and departments has made note of the actual solution for government efficiency: adequate staffing, documentation, and complementary, not supplanting, technology for simple and repetitive processes. Supplanting technology, such as AI, cannot fix these issues and in fact will exacerbate them as poor data produces poor results. Ditch the mach ine learning and properly staff agencies 
and departments for truly effective and efficient administration of government programs and projects.
