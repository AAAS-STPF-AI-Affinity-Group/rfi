General Comment
AI has been stealing from  innum erable people since it forced it's way into the public eye. These people claim  to be m aking som ething new
when it is built nigh exclusively off of stolen content to "train their AI". No business that relies on stealing should be legal, or even exist in
the first place. These people are not using AI for the betterm ent of society, they have no plans on doing so. They are here to m ake m oney
off of stealing from  others, that's what they've always been after. They've stolen from  artists, writers, m usicians, coders, and countless
m ore. This is a scourge we m ust be rid of, not encourage. And I'm  sure you'll be hearing that a lot as the countless people they've stolen
from  rem ind you that stealing is stealing, we do NOT give them  consent to use our personal posts, our pictures, our projects and m ore to
build their em pire upon. They should be penalized for everything they've already stolen, not given a wave of the hand and perm ission to do
it freely.
