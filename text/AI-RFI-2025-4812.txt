General Comment
I'm  a professional artist. I have been for the better part of two decades. Most of m y friends are also in the art field. Absolutely zero of us
support the use of generative AI in all of its form s.
Generative AI is part of an insidious culture that's reared its ugly head and attacked m y friends and m yself directly through theft of
personal copywritten work, through theft of jobs, and theft of incom e. Generative AI will selfishly destroy not only the artists it steals from ,
but the hum anity within art itself.
Art IS hum anity. Artificial Intelligence is NOT.
By allowing generative AI to freely steal and m indlessly regurgitate art you are actively supporting the destruction of hum an culture, as well
as the disintegration of law.
Com plex creativity is what separates us from  other anim als on this planet, so com plex creativity needs to be protected.
