General Comment
AI is giving com panies the ability to steal artists works without consent, and with this plan, lawsuits will becom e null and void. You are just
throwing actual artist that put their heart and soul into this creations to the curb, is that really what you want, for thousands of actual artist
to not be able to protect their work? I'd really think about this if I were you, especially since this will cause problem s for com panies in the
long run.
