General Comment
I believe certain AI tools in areas such as data analysis or physical sim ulation can be quite useful. I personally am  very against increased
investm ent and developm ent of generative artificial intelligent tools or large language m odels. The product of these program s covers no
new ground, and are incapable of pushing its content past what exists in its training data. I am  against AI com panies profiting off of
uncom pensated works from  authors, journalists, photographers, or visual artists.
