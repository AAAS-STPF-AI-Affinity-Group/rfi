General Comment
It is not burdensom e to lim it AI to m aterials not within copyright-- it is the purpose of copyright to prevent unwanted reproduction and
dissem ination of copyrighted m aterial. This idea that AI is entitled to all m aterial regardless of copyright com pletely flies in the face of
every business and intellectual property interest that Am erica has built over its long history. From  Mickey Mouse to Superm an, Am erica's
pop culture industry is a m ajor econom ic concern that needs protection, and allowing a few tech corporations to freely copy and "train"
their LLMs and other m odels on these valuable Am erican assets, elim inating their exclusivity and m aking their copyright status m oot, will
only hurt our econom y.
