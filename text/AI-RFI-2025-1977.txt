General Comment
AI needs to be regulated so it doesn't infringe on Am ericans copyright of their work and so it does not harm  the environm ent. A single
ChatGPT query uses up a bottle of water, a resource that is already scarce in m any of the regions these data centers are being built.
Genrative AI is a threat to Am ericans livelihoods and by threatening our environm ent, our lives.
