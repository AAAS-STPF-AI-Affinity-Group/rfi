General Comment
AI steals from  the hard work of m e and m any artist and writer Am ericans, and does not have a place in this country that was built from
our ancestors that do not consent to their content to be stolen. It is overhyped by a select few and has been influencing horrible decisions
throughout the entire industry. Itâ€™s beyond disgusting that generative AI has com e this far.
