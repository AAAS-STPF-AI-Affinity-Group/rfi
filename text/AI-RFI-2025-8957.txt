General Comment
AS a lawyer, I face the increasing problem  that m any of the applications and services I am  using are autom atically uploading the words I
write to train various AIs. This is a huge problem . Not only is it a copyright violation, but the risk of divulging privileged, confidential, and
highly sensitive inform ation from  m y clients is real. There are m any exam ples of AI tools spitting out privileged inform ation to their users
out there. 
Every application and service needs an easy way to turn off the program 's ability to upload the user's inform ation to train AIs so that
confidential, privileged, and sensitive inform ation is not uploaded to the AI and then given (without the original user's knowledge or
consent) to future users. 
Knowing this, I have an ethical duty to never use a tool that m ight upload m y or m y client's text to train an AI.
Please m ake sure that every program  has an easy to find "opt out" that stops the tool from  uploading user data to train an AI.
