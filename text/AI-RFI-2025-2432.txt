General Comment
The idea that we have to throw copyright to the wind in the interest of national security is insane and just a blatant giveaway to the big tech
firm s who already hold outsize influence. If data is so im portant to these m odels then these tech com panies need to pay for it- we all know
they have the m oney given they’re oligarchs and we- the creators of said content are the serfs. And yet it’s som ehow not im portant
enough to m erit paying for it. How can these two ideas exist sim ultaneously? They can’t. The e tech firm s have showed their hands- they
need this data. They can pay for it.
