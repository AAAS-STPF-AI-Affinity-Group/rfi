General Comment
As a writer, m y livelihood depends on m y ability to create. Generative AI like OpenAI and its ilk have been trained on work stolen
without authorization or com pensation from  thousands of writers. To shield them  from  copyright lawsuits would be giving them
authorization for the theft theyâ€™ve already com m itted, as well as encouragem ent to com m it further theft. This cannot be allowed to happen.
