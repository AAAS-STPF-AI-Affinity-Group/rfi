General Comment
As a citizen and a creative, it is clear to m e that the developm ent & proliferation of AI generated content is predicated on the theft and
digital butchery of intellectual works of audio-visual and textual m edia. These program s do nothing m ore than collate data and piece the
work of people like m e into derivative slop with no understanding of text, subtext, or context. Allowing com panies like Open AI to scrape
the works of people like m yself and feed it into their algorithm s is only harm ful to us and to people potentially convinced by engineered
content they create.
