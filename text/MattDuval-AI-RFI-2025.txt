Good evening,
I'm very concerned about removement of any restrictions on un-compensated use of
intellectual property during AI development. The use of other person's intellectual property inthe development of AI without acknowledgement or compensation undermines the ability andincentive for people to share their labor and benefit from it under copyright law. It is theft andrequires oversight so that during this AI development the person's involved employ proper fairuse and permissions before taking advantage of others' work. 
Thank you,
M Duval
