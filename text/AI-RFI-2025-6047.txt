General Comment
Hello. m y nam e is Mr Yergeau and I am  the owner of the independent studio Starlight Com ics. As a studio prim arily concerned with the
creation of com ic books and anim ation we are extrem ely concerned about the wild west that is the current AI landscape, and find the
current attitude take by big tech to be anti business and anti consum er. Our prim ary concern is the consum ption of data by the AI
com panies. They currently have been feeding on any data posted online, com pletely ignoring copyright laws. We put a lot of hard work
into our products and we are fiercely protective of our IP, as are m any com panies, such as Disney for instance. Just as a television station
cannot air what it does not have the rights to, or as a m ovie theater cannot just show any m ovie it wants without perm ission, so to do we
believe an AI cannot use our data without perm ission. Any AI trained on web data m ust be done only with the full consent of the IP
owners, otherwise what is even the point of copyright law. It could be dangerous to if the AI com panies are given cart-blanch to troll the
internet for data, as we believe it could pose a national security risk. what if they accidentally m anage to retrieve sensitive and confidential
data and feed it into their system s. What about private personal data? It is all very concerning and we believe big tech needs to be reigned
in. 
In short:
-Big tech should require clear, written consent before feeding on privately owned IPs and m edia.
Thank you for your tim e.
