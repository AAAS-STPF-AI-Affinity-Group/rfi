General Comment
Please do not allow OpenAI to scan over the entire of the internet with m assive freedom . 
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
AI is over-hyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
I think AI created artwork, writings, etc robs people with actual creative ideas their voice as it will be replaced by flooding of nothing but
plagiarized, unoriginal ideas that will be be sent over and over again.
