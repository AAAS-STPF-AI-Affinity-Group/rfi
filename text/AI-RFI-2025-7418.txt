General Comment
If anyone else were to com m it m assive violations like this they’d face appropriate consequences. Nobody is above the law unless you are
wealthy apparently. 
If we have any decency at all this should be put to rest and everyone put in their place. 
As a creative m yself I do not condone the use of m y work to train som eone else’s generation AI and I have never felt com pelled to use it
in m y work. I am  not a thief and do not condone theft.
