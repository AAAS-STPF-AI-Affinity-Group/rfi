General Comment
I refuse to allow this sort of thing. If this passes, I can assure you that no one from  this current run of politicians will be back. I certainly
will not be voting for them , regardless of party. This isn't a m atter of political parties, it's privacy and trying to take away what others
worked so hard to m ake just for som e cheap profits without actually involving the original creators.
