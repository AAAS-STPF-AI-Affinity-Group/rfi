General Comment
Generative large learning m odels (LLMs) require regulation to prevent infringem ent on copyright and other intellectual property issues.
Current LLM im plem entations are intellectually fraudulent and steal works from  hum an creators. This m ust be prevented if regulations are
created.
Further, training LLMs on public internet forum s has resulted in seeding the LLMs with the worst of Am erica's thoughts - m isogyny,
racism , casual offensive language and disregard for other people. Reddit and Twitter are sim ply not good training inputs. 
Regulation against using LLMs to generate m isleading content is also critically im portant.
