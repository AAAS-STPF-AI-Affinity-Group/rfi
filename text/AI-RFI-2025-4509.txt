General Comment
Allowing copyright exceptions for AI training will do m ore to harm  Am ericans than help them . AI can only copy the works of what it is
trained on. Therefore, works created by AI will be worse versions of things that already exist. However, by allowing the writing and
artistic work of hard working Am ericans to be used for AI training, the goal of the adoption of AI is to drive them  out of the m arket while
replacing them  with worse outputs. The net result is that it will be harder for Am ericans to work in artistic fields and our country's artistic
and cultural output will fall behind that of other countries.
