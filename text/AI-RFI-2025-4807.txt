General Comment
I am  stridently against this as both a m aker and consum er of art. I do not wish to see or experience art generated by AI, and I do not
consent to m y art being used by genAI; if the governm ent em powers these com panies to take m y content, I will sim ply m ake it unavailable
digitally. This will destroy livelihoods, poison data integrity, and disgusts m e as a US citizen.
