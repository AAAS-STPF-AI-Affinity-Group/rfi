General Comment
I do not believe that generative AI holds a place in the future of the US. I do not believe it is fair to individuals to have their likeness, their
creation, their copyright taken without their consent and used in generative AI without their input or without com pensating the individual. I
do not believe the investm ent in the infrastructure needed for generative AI is worth the infringem ent on the rights and privacy of the
individual ordinary citizen.
