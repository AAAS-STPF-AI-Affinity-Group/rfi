General Comment
AI has proven to be not only a failing industry but it rips away the very intention, direction and passion m ade by those who could do the
work without a program  that cobbles together works by people who did not consent to their works being m anipulated and then
processed into work they had no hand in. The use of Generative AI has caused m any within the creative fields to be scrutinized and at
tim es denied em ploym ent within the industry based on speculations of AI m anipulated works. Technology like this should be used to help
elevate those within fields that could best utilize this to bring out their full potential, not to allow people to cut corners because they do not
wish to put in the work that som eone took days, m onths, even years to perfect and craft. The user is only as good as their tool but if the
tool is nothing m ore than a destructive force then it has no benefit for its purpose.
