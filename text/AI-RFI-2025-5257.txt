General Comment
Do not let this plan go through. Anyone who has been paying attention to AI knows and understands full well that generative AI cannot
function without stealing and scraping hum an-m ade text and m edia. This plan would blatantly allow OpenAI, Google, and its ilk to bypass
copyright laws in the nam e of "progress" and put the creators that they steal from  out of a job. Do not let this plan pass because the things
that hum ans create will always be far m ore valuable than what a com puter can hallucinate.
