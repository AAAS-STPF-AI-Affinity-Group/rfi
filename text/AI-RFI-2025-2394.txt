General Comment
Big tech com panies should NOT profit from  the hard work of individual artists around the globe without providing these artists with
m onetary com pensation for their contributions. Com panies using any creative m edia to train AI m odels should be REQUIRED to (1)
obtain explicit, written consent from  artists before using their work in AI training, and (2) pay royalties to the original creators for the use
of their work in both AI training and content generation.
As a com pany working closely with m any talented artists, we understand firsthand that creating artistic m edia requires dedication, skill,
and genuine effort. We firm ly believe that the creative talents of artists everywhere deserve respect and recognition. Our m ission is to
em power INDIVIDUALS, whose creativity and im agination m ake entertainm ent possible. We would consider it a failure on our part if
we allowed large corporations to overshadow the beauty and uniqueness of individual creation. There is inherent value in the art created
by individuals around the world, and itâ€™s tim e these artists receive the recognition and com pensation they rightfully deserve.
Em powering creativity together,
Harrison Thorne
