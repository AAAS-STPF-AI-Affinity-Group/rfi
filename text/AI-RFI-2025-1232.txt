General Comment
As they presently exist, AI technology is sim ply a copyright laundering m achine that's been unable to deliver on its lofty prom ises.
Weakening copyright law to prop up this failing business can only stand to weaken the united states cultural dom inance in the
entertainm ent industry while burning valuable investm ent capital.
