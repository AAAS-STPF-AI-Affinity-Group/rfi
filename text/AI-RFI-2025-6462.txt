General Comment
Generative AI is nothing but a wasteful drain of tim e and resources. It's fueled by stolen work and is already on borrowed tim e. It will
eventually feed on itself m ore than actual works, resulting in a cycle of self-poisoning. From  a m oral standpoint, allowing generative AI
free reign is wrong. Artists work hard enough as is and this will only m ake it harder by allowing the legal theft of that hard work. From  a
logical standpoint, it's also an extrem ely poor investm ent. The resources needed to fuel generative AI is incredibly wasteful and the "AI
bubble" will eventually pop, m aking the waste even m ore unnecessary. Generative AI is a dead end and should be discouraged at all
possible levels.
