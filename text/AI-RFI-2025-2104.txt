General Comment
Putting forth AI as a solution to our current problem s is going to drive business away from  the United States and create negative jobs if we
don't regulate it and enforce copyright. Putting our trust in the hands of AI instead of hardworking Am ericans is opposite to what our
values should be as a country.
