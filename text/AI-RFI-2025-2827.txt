General Comment
Generative Artificial Intelligence has no right to train on data, and thereby profiting off of, things they do not own. It is theft. Doing this is
destructive to artists, who overwhelm ingly do not want this AI technology, as it is destroying their livelihood. AI is harm ful to the general
public and selling them  out for profit is not ethical.
