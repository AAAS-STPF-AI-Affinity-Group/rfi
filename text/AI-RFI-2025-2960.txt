General Comment
As a freelance artist, AI has NO place in the world. it is a scam , a shill, and is not profitable. Nobody likes it. Nobody likes it forced upon
them  on EVERY single website. it's been shown generative AI is m aking people DUMBER, and m ajority of Am ericans already can't read
above a 6th grade level. Not only that, but it steals the hard work from  thousands of artists, replacing them  and stealing their jobs, which
m akes AI m ake NO m oney.
Every artist who has had their work stolen has never received financial com pensation, and m ajority of artists are leaving the internet, which
m eans AI will soon have nothing to steal from  anyways. 
AI HAS NO PLACE IN AMERICA AND SHOULD BE HEAVILT REGULATED WITH STRONGER COPYRIGHTS IN PLACE
TO PROTECT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM.
NO AI CLONING FOR VOICE ACTORS, FOR WRITERS, FOR ARTISTS, FOR MUSICIANS--AI IS NOT THE FUTURE.
it is incredibly dam aging to the environm ent on top of it all.
