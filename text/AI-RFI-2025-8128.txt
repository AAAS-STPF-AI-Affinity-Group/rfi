General Comment
Generative AI is based on copyright law violations. It is theft of the intellectual property rights of thousands of Am ericans. AI is deeply
flawed and prom otion of it by the Federal Governm ent is a grave m istake. This RFI provided too short a deadline for the public to have
adequate tim e to respond.
