General Comment
I strongly object to any action that would allow com panies engaged in research and developm ent of artificial intelligence to train their
m odels on copyrighted work. Content scraping is plagiarism , pure and sim ple. These com panies should play by the sam e rules as
everyone else: proper citation, acknowledgem ent, and com pensation of copyright holders is the only fair way to m ake use of copyrighted
m aterial. Artists, authors, writers, thinkers, and content creators deserve legal protection, and legal recourse m ust be m ade available to
them  in the event that their work is used without their consent.
