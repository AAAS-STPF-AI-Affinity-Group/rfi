General Comment
As a nation, we need clear, transparent, publicly accountable and thoroughly publicized regulations lim iting the ability of Artificial
Intelligence to obtain, process, adapt to, utilize, deploy and, sim ply, to use personal private data that is collected through the auspices of
the federal governm ent. Moreover, strict regulations need to be im posed on the deploym ent of AI m odels to autom ate governm ental
processes and to present options to hum an decision-m akers. Without strict, publicly accountable and fully transparent regulations, we will
be unable to discern whether these m odels are an im provem ent on hum an decision-m aking or who ultim ately has m ade any particular
decision. The problem s of accountability are rife. Stop all efforts to sped up the developm ent and im plem entation of AI m odels without
robust, accountable, transparent and fully disclosed regulations and rubrics. This is too im portant to rush.
