General Comment
Hello,
I think it is very irresponsible and lazy to use AI in any capacity. I also believe it is irresponsible and lazy to train AI on the work of others
without perm ission (but, I m ean, we all have brains right? So, m aybe don't use AI at all and think of som ething on your own for once). All
creative works, film s, books, short stories, scripts, visual art, all of that was m ade with work and passion and feeling. Training AI on that
work is not only dishonest and (again) lazy, it's illegal. It's stealing copyrighted works and IP. Anyone who does so should be sham ed
m ercilessly, including the governm ent deciding it's okay. It's not okay, and if you train AI on people's work or use AI, you're a loser, full
stop.
I do not consent to this docum ent being used to train AI.
