General Comment
Hello. I believe AI, while it can absolutely be beneficial, has intruded too far into lives of the average person. AI really, desperately needs
to be regulated. I don’t want to see people falling for scam s generated by AI—photos and voice recordings and advertisem ents and
dating profiles and phishing em ails, these are way too easy for people to create. I don’t want to see the tim e when AI becom es so
painfully indistinguishable from  reality that it ends up in a legal hearing (because eventually, that will happen). I don’t want to see every
beautiful m an m ade thing in this world get replaced by sloppy generated am algam ations. And I seriously do not want to see the President
of the United States venerating him self with AI generated nonsense. Generative AI shouldn’t be rem otely as accessible as it currently is. I
don’t think the average person should have it, I don’t think politicians should have it, I don’t think anyone should have it. What’s the point
of it all? You can create whatever your heart desires. Nifty. But what about the scam m ers? The new awakened world cybercrim e?
Technology is evolving significantly faster than we as hum an beings can adapt to it. Maybe I’m  just a Luddite, but nothing about generative
AI seem s worth it.
