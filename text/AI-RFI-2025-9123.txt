General Comment
This is a joke. The "unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents" in this is the copyright laws that protect everyone else from  having their work
stolen. It's the law of the land and should not be open to special carve-outs for AI com panies just because their useless, wasteful
application does not work without theft. Not just som e theft. The m ost theft. The theft of absolutely everything that has ever touched the
internet. It underm ines the hard work of everyone but these AI com panies and all for a huge waste of energy and resources that costs
m ore than it earns and is only buoyed by a speculation bubble.
