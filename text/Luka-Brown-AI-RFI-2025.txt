I do not believe in deregulation of AI restrictions. This is a new technology and we need to
protect IP and Copyright laws as they currently are until we understand more about how AIcan affect emerging artists and content creators. AI does not create original content, so stiflingactual creators or making it harder for them to create will ultimately hurt us more in the longrun.
 
Thanks,
Luka
