General Comment
AI is fraud-based industry, intent on destroying the very people and industries that it claim s to require to function. These industries,
including the creative and art industries, are driven by real hum an beings, whose lives and well-being will be under threat by this salacious
tool. It isn't a m atter of national security, nor progress, or any other nice-sounding im plication of altruism  --it's a grift by an ill-m eaning
oligarch, looking to take dollars out of hard working Am erican pockets by robbing them  with their own knife. It's a sick volley for power,
nothing m ore. Least of all, if it's truly an im portant m atter, then those whose work will be used to train these system s should be offered
lucrative com pensation for any work used--as their efforts wield im m easurably m ore value then any current AI--as evidenced by OpenAI
and others perpetual theft and copyright infringing chicanery. If it's im portant, PAY FOR IT. If you want it, BUY IT. GET
PERMISSION. MAKE YOUR OWN. This is Am erica, isn't it, or is that only true when it's convenient? Tell Altm an to pull him self up by
his bootstraps, get perm ission from  creators, and sign som e checks or GET LOST. With no due respect.
