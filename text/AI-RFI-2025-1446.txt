General Comment
I am  a united states citizen and an am ateur writer. I consider m y writing to be m y art, and m any of the people I associate are also artists in
one way or another. I speak for m ost artists in this country when I say that we see the rise of Generative AI tools like Large Language
Models and Stable Diffusion as threats to our careers, livelihoods, and artistic integrity. The only way Generative AI can function to any
large-scale capacity is if it is trained on copyrighted works. Our works. The individuals behind these tools have shown tim e and tim e again
that they blatantly disregard our own desires for how we want our work to be used, feeding it to their m achines without our perm ission.
They then use these tools to attem pt to replace us, generating im ages rather than hiring artists.
Generative AI is not a tool for aiding creativity, it is a tool for replacing it. How is one to m ake m oney off of one's artwork when an
executive can type a few sentences into a text bar and get som ething that they think is good enough? The United States has always been a
country that gives birth to wonderful works of art and literature, so why destroy that legacy by allowing a m achine to do it?
I heavily encourage those creating this plan to protect the intellectual property of artists (including writers, m usicians, and film m akers), and
to place lim its on com m ercial uses of AI-generated content in order to protect the jobs of artists.
