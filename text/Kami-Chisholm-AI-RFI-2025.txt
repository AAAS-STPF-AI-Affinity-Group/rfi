As a filmmaker and artist, I vehemently object to you redefining
copyright and taking away artists rights. You may think this theft will
be a great thing for AI, but it will not be. AI can only steal from and
imitate artists, and if you do this, all you are doing is incentivizing
artists to quit and/or never share their work again. There will be no
more art, no more culture, only random, soulless, AI slop endlessly
copying each other in a degraded loop.
Stop allowing these tech monsters to steal from us. If they can't afford
to pay license fees to artists, they don't have a viable business.
