General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. Based on m y expertise as a linguist, it is clear to m e that generative AI is not only
far from  achieving anything close to hum an like linguistic or cognitive capacity, the choice to adopt hum an speech-like linguistic traits into
AI is com pletely unethical and deceptive. Com panies who tout the capacity of their gen AI products are overhyping and lying to the public
â€”and creating tools to that plagiarize, surveille, and launder bias and errors from  input datasets.
