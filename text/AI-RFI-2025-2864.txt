General Comment
The Federal governm ent should not consider broad support and em powerm ent of private sector actors who have not yet dem onstrated
sufficient need nor dem and for their generative AI products. It is against the interests of the Am erican people to gam ble with tax, energy,
and ethics so that generative AI actors can figure out what sticks to the wall.
If anything, we need regulations that protect Am erican interests against harvesting and training on personal data and intellectual properties.
Regulation against how generative AI is used in the private and public sectors should also be considered.
