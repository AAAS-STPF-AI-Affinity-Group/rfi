General Comment
AI is a very powerful tool that can really revolutionize a lot of industries, but is also very dangerous to m any different industries. AI
endangers not only the environm ent due to the am ount of water and energy it uses, the the jobs of m any hardworking Am ericans, the IPs
of m any com panies and is especially dangerous in m any of the form s its being used in. There area already so m any industries where AI has
failed and has the capacity to cause im m ense and irreparable dam age, such as in the health field. We don't need less restrictions on AI, we
absolutely need m ore of them .
