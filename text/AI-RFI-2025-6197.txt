General Comment
Copyright law is vital to livelihood of artists. AI, without safeguards, presents an existential threat to the future of art in this country. AI
should not be able to have unfettered access to any and everything in the world. No to AI. Yes to artists. Yes to copyright enforcem ent
against com panies who seek to steal the property that others have worked for years to cultivate.
