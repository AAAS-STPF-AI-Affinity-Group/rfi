RE: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
INTRODUCTION
Greetings,
My name is Lewis D. Migliore. I am currently pursuing a law degree and have 
previously worked as a funeral home attendant, as well as a law clerk for a criminal 
defense firm. I engage with technology on a daily basis and have observed significant 
advancements in artificial intelligence over the past two years. 
 I commend the executive office and the National Science Foundation for their 
efforts to regulate this rapidly evolving technology. Additionally, I express my gratitude to
the National Science Foundation for providing me with the opportunity to contribute 
input on concrete policy initiatives that should be included in the “AI Action Plan.”
Outlined below are the specific policy initiatives that I believe will most effectively 
enhance human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security in relation 


2to AI.  These measures aim to ensure a brighter future for all Americans as we transition
into the age of artificial intelligence. 
I. American Workers First
One of President Trump's primary campaign promises was to prioritize the American
economy and the American workforce. Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) possesses the 
potential to generate substantial wealth and provide more efficient and effective 
solutions for both public and private sectors. This technology is truly groundbreaking 
and is poised to have a transformative impact on nearly every industry in the American 
workforce. To ensure that this transformation benefits all Americans, it is imperative that 
these positive economic effects are extended to everyone, rather than being 
concentrated among the select few who own the AI. By doing so, we can fulfill the 
promise of prioritizing the American worker and achieving the most desirable outcome 
for the nation's entire economy.
A significant risk threatening the average American worker is the potential for 
widespread job losses due to AI automation. Recently, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei 
forecasted that in the next 3-6 months, AI will be writing 90% of company’s code, and 
within the next year, AI will generate nearly all of the company’s code. Additionally, 
Presidential advisor and businessman Elon Musk predicted at the 2024 Vivatech 
Conference that as AI advances it will result in mass automation becoming prevalent, 
and that  as a result “probably none of us will have a job.”  
Therefore, one concrete policy initiative that should be emphasized in the “AI Action 
Plan” is that the human worker should be prioritized and placed before artificial 
intelligence machines. This is of particular importance in industries like governance, 


3medicine, and law where empathy in decision making is crucial. Again, it is of the 
utmost importance that we ensure that artificial intelligence machines never entirely 
replace human workers and their roles. Instead, AI should be used by human beings as 
a tool to make their work more productive, efficient, and effective. 
At first glance it may seem appealing for government leaders, employers and 
business executives to replace workers with machines in an effort to save money and 
increase productivity, especially as AI continues to advance. However, this approach 
should be avoided and discouraged. 
Work is a significant part of our culture. It provides purpose and fulfillment. It is 
ancient. From the beginning of human civilization individuals have taken pride in mixing 
their labor with the natural world around them to produce goods and services that 
provide for themselves and their families.  Work allows individuals to directly shape and 
impact their communities. It gives individuals an opportunity to achieve, to find 
fulfillment, to develop themselves, and to leave a legacy. In fact,  working is one of the 
most meaningful ways people express themselves and interact with the world around 
them. 
In my hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the work individuals do makes up a 
significant part of their identity. From steel workers, to lawyers, to doctors, to factory 
workers they all find purpose in the work they do and are rewarded with tremendous 
pride in knowing that they matter, they contribute to the community, and that they can 
provide by their own hand and through their own efforts. 


4If mass layoffs in the public and private sectors were to come at the hands of AI 
automation it would remove this purpose which is a core part of many Americans’ 
identity. This would likely result in a mass cultural and mental health crisis. This is 
because mass automation would remove the ability for people to depend on themselves
and their own skills in earning their own way and would instead make them dependent 
on government handouts like universal basic income or the severance packages that  
their companies offer them. The purpose, fulfillment, independence, personal 
development, and community all created from work would be lost. This would likely 
have a devasting psychological impact on the average American worker and have a 
negative net impact on our culture and society. 
To avoid this the American worker should be put first. Instead of replacing the 
worker with a machine, the machine should be used as a tool by the worker to improve 
individual performance, increase human efficiency, and excel human achievement to 
new heights. As iconic American musician Prince famously said, “it’s cool to use the 
computer, but don’t let the computer use you.” 
Therefore, included in the “AI Action Plan” should be policy that discourages 
mass replacement of workers with machines. Instead, the action plan should 
promulgate policy that encourages companies and government to utilize artificial 
intelligence as a tool to excel human achievement to new heights. The AI Action Plan 
should also encourage individuals and companies to never place complete faith in AI 
systems. Rather,  all results obtained by AI should be assessed by a human being to 
ensure that they are ethical, accurate, and reliable. AI systems should be encouraged to
be used to enhance human reasoning rather than to completely supplant it. 


5Further, an essential aspect of integrating AI into society is ensuring that our 
workforce is equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to work alongside these 
advanced technologies. So rather than replacing workers companies, governments, and
educational institutions should adapt their curricula to include comprehensive AI and 
technology courses and training. This will foster a new generation of tech-savvy 
individuals who can thrive in a rapidly evolving job market and  use these tools to 
perform at a higher level. Training programs should be made accessible to current 
workers, providing them with opportunities to upskill and reskill, allowing them to 
effectively utilize AI as a tool rather than seeing it as a threat to their livelihoods. Again, 
AI training should emphasize that technology is a tool to supplement and aid in critical 
thinking, not something met to replace it. 
In summary, the transformative potential of AI should be harnessed responsibly 
to benefit all Americans and enhance human work rather than replace it. Prioritizing the 
American worker, equipping our workforce with the necessary skills, and promoting 
policies that encourage the use of AI as a tool and not a replacement, can help preserve
the purpose fulfillment, human expression, and development derived from work. 
II. Bipartisan Cooperation
Due to the transformative and ever evolving nature of this groundbreaking technology, 
cooperation across party lines is paramount.  In these political divisive times 
collaboration may sometimes seem like an impossibility, however Americans must find a
way to unify when it comes to addressing technology as revolutionary as artificial 
intelligence. 


6Thus, the AI Action Plan should highlight the innovative nature of this technology 
and underscore the necessity for collaboration across our government and society. We 
must all come together to formulate and implement sensible regulations, strategies, and
guidelines. We must set aside our differences and unite to address this profound 
change. As Benjamin Franklin famously said, “We must all hang together, or we will 
surely hang separately.”  If we do not collaborate for the common good regarding this 
technology, it may lead to our demise. 
Consequently, bipartisan cooperation is essential to effectively regulate AI and 
ensure that the benefits are shared across all segments of society. The development 
and implementation of groundbreaking AI technologies transcend political ideologies 
and demand a unified approach. Law makers, policy makers, and citizenry from both 
sides of the aisle must collaborate to create comprehensive policies that safeguard 
public interests, promote innovation, and address potential risks.  We need to ensure 
that this technology works for the benefit of everyone and not just a select few.
Therefore, the AI action plan should encourage the continued operation and 
expansion of the “AI Task Force”. This task force should be encouraged to consider 
different perspectives regarding the topic from people of all walks of life. 
By continuing to have bipartisan effort in regulating AI we can bridge gaps, foster 
trust among stakeholders and citizenry, present a balanced perspective that 
incorporates diverse viewpoints, and bolster innovation. This continued cooperation will 
not only strengthen regulatory frameworks but also enhance the credibility and 
legitimacy of AI governance. By working together, we can create robust policies that 
protect privacy, prevent misuse, and promote ethical AI usage while fostering an 


7environment conducive to technological advancement, unification, and economic 
strength.
By collaborating on this significant issue, the bitter political divisions in the 
country may be reduced, benefits could be more widely experienced, and trust in 
government by the general public might be restored. AI is likely to transform our society.
This transformation should be one that unites us and benefits us all. 
The existing AI task force plays a crucial role in strengthening this bipartisan 
effort. Thus, it is imperative that the AI task force continue to operate. Said AI task force 
should be expanded to not just more members of our government, but to also bring 
together technologists, ethicists, sociologists, lawyers, policymakers and other experts 
to address the complexities of AI integration in society. Their collective expertise would 
ensure that the policies developed are well-rounded and represent all walks of life in our
society. Considering the multifaceted impact of AI on different sectors, this spirit of unity 
and collaboration is of the utmost importance. 
The existing task force should be encouraged to conduct thorough assessments 
of AI technologies, identifying potential risks, and recommending safeguards to prevent 
misuse. They should also be encouraged to be responsible for evaluating the ethical 
implications of AI applications and ensuring that technology aligns with our societal 
values, laws, and our Constitution. By providing a platform for continuous dialogue and 
collaboration, the task force can  help bridge the gap between rapid technological 
advancements and the slower pace of legislative processes. The task force can provide 
valuable updates to Americans who are seeking to be informed on the changes, and 
work together to address and legislate novel legal issues like the implications of AI on 


8intellectual property.  Additionally, the task force can help foster unity among the 
American people in some of the most divisive times we have seen. 
Moreover, the continued operation and expansion of a bipartisan AI task force 
could enhance transparency and accountability in AI governance. Regular reports and 
updates from the task force can keep the public informed about the state of AI 
development and its implications.  This transparency would foster trust among citizens, 
assuaging fears of unchecked AI deployment and reinforcing the government's 
commitment to protecting public interests and promoting human flourishing.
In summary, promotion and expansion of bipartisan cooperation in AI regulation, 
supported by our existing AI task force, would not only strengthen the regulatory 
framework but also ensure that AI technologies are developed and implemented in a 
manner that benefits all Americans. This collective approach would help harness AI's 
potential for the greater good, benefiting all Americans and maintaining the nation's 
competitive edge on the global stage in an ethical and legal manner.
III. Privacy, Transparency and Oversight
Artificial Intelligence systems can collect and monitor large amounts of data,
including sensitive personal information.  The AI Action Plan should ensure data is 
collected solely for the specific purpose of the AI system using it. This purpose, absent 
a compelling reason to keep it classified, should be published and readily accessible to 
the general public. Citizenry should understand both how AI systems work, and how 
they make decisions. Data usage by the AI system should fulfill its enumerated  purpose 
only and not be used for anything outside of that scope.  Absent a compelling reason, 
like national security, citizenry should be able to see the data that AI systems are trained


9on, and the data they collect in making their decisions. This will promote transparency 
and protect privacy interests.  To further protect privacy the task force mentioned above,
or another agency, should conduct regular audits of all AI systems used in government  
to assess that they are acting with respect to the privacy of the citizenry, and to ensure 
that the systems are not being used outside of the scope of their clearly defined 
purpose. Any data collected should only be collected if the user explicitly consents to 
said collection. 
Additionally, it is of the utmost importance that proper cybersecurity systems are 
put in place to protect the personal data of Americans from international enemies, 
hackers, and other bad actors who seek to improperly use it.
One idea in promulgating this policy is to open-source the datasets used by AI 
systems wherever possible. This would provide full transparency and allow for 
continuous improvement of the AI systems through public scrutiny and collaboration. In 
cases where open-sourcing is not feasible due to national security or privacy concerns, 
there should be stringent guidelines and oversight, perhaps by the “AI Task Force”,  to  
ensure the data is used ethically, legally and responsibly. Our government should 
prioritize open-sourcing to the greatest extent possible, and companies should be 
encouraged to follow suit. Through open sourcing we can create a culture of 
transparency, build trust and drive technological advancement that benefits all 
Americans. With that being said, some data should be kept confidential if it is found to 
pose a significant national security risk. This confidential data can be reviewed by 
certain members of Congress, perhaps the AI Task force, or an agency to ensure that it 
is not being misused.


10Another essential policy initiative is the establishment of benchmarking systems 
for companies and government agencies. These benchmarks would serve as standards
for evaluating the performance, accuracy, and ethical and legal compliance of AI 
systems. Regular assessments against these benchmarks would ensure that AI 
technologies meet the highest standards and operate within the defined ethical and 
legal frameworks. Benchmarking can also promote healthy competition among 
developers, pushing them to innovate while adhering to ethical and legal guidelines. 
Perhaps a body like the existing “AI Task Force” mentioned above could be responsible 
for creating these benchmarks and ensuring that they are being complied with. 
Incorporating these ideas into the AI Action Plan would significantly enhance 
transparency, accountability, and trust in government. Open-sourcing datasets and 
establishing benchmarks would create an environment where AI systems are 
continually evaluated and improved, while also ensuring they operate in a fair manner 
that benefits everyone. These measures would not only bolster public trust but also 
contribute to the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, 
maximizing their benefits while mitigating potential risks.
Moreover, National security agencies should be instructed not to create a mass 
surveillance state or engage in extensive personal data collection against the citizenry. It
is crucial that we balance the need for security with the protection of individual liberties, 
and individual privacy as outlined in the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees a 
reasonable expectation of privacy. AI surveillance technologies, if left unchecked or 
made to extensive, could lead to an erosion of trust between the government and its 
citizens, fostering a climate of fear and suspicion and a creation of a mass surveillance 


11state. Transparency, oversight, and strict limitations on data collection and storage  
should be established to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically within the 
national security framework. There should be a clearly enumerated purpose for each AI 
system used by our government. No data should be collected that falls outside of the 
scope of said purpose. For national security agencies it may not be feasible to publish 
this to the general public due to the need to keep some information confidential. 
Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that a detached impartial body, like the  AI task 
force, have access to this information and can oversee the data use to ensure that it 
complies with our individual rights. Thus, the AI action plan should emphasize that 
Human oversight is key in ensuring that AI aligns with the constitutional protections of 
privacy.
Private initiatives like Sam Altman's Worldcoin, which gather extensive personal 
data, should be discouraged as they threaten individual privacy. 
Worldcoin is a cryptocurrency project founded by Sam Altman, aiming to provide 
universal access to the global economy. Its mission includes distributing tokens to 
everyone in exchange for iris scans of the human eye. Biometric data collection like this 
is invasive, and a risk to individual privacy and security, as it involves storing sensitive 
personal information. Invasive practices like these should be discouraged from the 
private sector and entirely prohibited throughout our government. 
Furthermore, the use of AI in the criminal justice system should be kept to an 
absolute minimum, particularly in areas involving human value judgments, such as 
sentencing. Decisions that deeply affect an individual's life and liberty should not be left 
to algorithms alone, as they lack the capacity for empathy, understanding, and moral 


12reasoning that humans possess. Implementing AI in these sensitive areas could lead to 
biases and injustices, further undermining public trust in our criminal justice system. 
Even if it comes at the expense of less efficiency and more costly procedures, these 
judgments should be almost entirely left to human beings.
Prioritizing human oversight and judgment in these critical areas ensures that 
technology serves as a tool for justice rather than a replacement for human wisdom. By 
maintaining this balance, we can harness the benefits of AI while upholding our core 
Constitutional values and principles. In conclusion, humans must remain in control of AI 
technologies, ensuring that they are developed and implemented responsibly, 
transparently, and ethically, aligning with societal values, laws, and our constitution. 
Data collection and usage should be kept to a minimum and invasive collection of 
personal information should be limited as much as possible. 
IV. Environmental Protections and Cultural Preservation
AI data centers consume a significant amount of energy, drawn from vast amounts of 
electricity and water. If the physical development of AI systems is left unchecked, it may 
overpower our power grid, lead to drought, or result in other devastating environmental 
effects. Moreover, electronic waste from data centers, and mineral use and extraction to
power these data centers, can also harm our environment. All of this should be 
accounted for in the AI Action Plan.  Development and protection of our real world 
should always take precedent over the digital one.  For every investment made toward 
the digital infrastructure, there should be a similar investment made for the protection of 
our environment. 


13Innovation and advancement are good, but not if they come at the expense of the
destruction of our natural world. Thus, it is essential that the AI Action Plan encourage 
data centers to be built and operated only in areas where there are sufficient resources 
to support them. Additionally, there should be limitations on the number of data centers 
constructed, energy used, and electronic waste produced.
If we do not enact these measures, our natural world may become overrun, our 
power grid may fail, and pollution and drought may increase tremendously. This would 
have a devastating effect on the economy. As we create and invest in this digital world, 
we should also make investments in the real world. Our national parks, hiking trails, 
rivers, fisheries, farms and oceans should be approached with just as much emphasis 
as AI. It is crucial that we balance our desire to innovate and advance  with respect and 
effort to protect our beautiful natural country.
V. Technology Addiction
The impact of technology and AI on our daily lives cannot be overstated. Many 
Americans today feel like they spend too much time online. Technology plays an 
excessively large role in our lives, contributing to anxiety disorders, fear, depression, 
addiction, and the dissemination of fake information. Thus, I believe the AI action plan 
should emphasize balance between the real world and the digital one.
AI should make us all more efficient, ideally freeing up more of our time. With this
free time, the government should promote "unplugging" from screens and engaging with
the natural world. This can be done through encouraging citizens to reduce their 
reliance on technology in their daily lives, promoting a balanced and healthy lifestyle. 
Campaigns can highlight the importance of taking breaks from screens, while health 


14agencies can publish reports and conduct studies on the harmful effects of excessive 
internet usage, and recommend non-digital alternatives to promote better mental health.
Additionally, government programs can actively promote the benefits of physical 
exercises, outdoor activities, and face-to-face interactions, encouraging citizens to take 
advantage of the natural beauty and resources available to them. Promoting our 
amazing National Parks and the tremendous opportunities for recreation that this great 
country has to offer, such as hiking, fishing, and simply spending time outdoors, can 
contribute to better mental health, physical health, and overall well-being.
Furthermore, educational institutions can play a pivotal role in addressing 
technology addiction. Schools and universities could integrate curricula that teach 
students about the responsible use of technology and the importance of maintaining a 
healthy digital balance. Workshops and seminars on digital detox strategies and 
mindfulness practices can help students understand how to manage their screen time 
effectively. Further instruction can be provided to help individuals distinguish real 
content from fake AI generated content.
Community centers and local organizations can also create programs and 
initiatives that encourage social engagement and physical activities. Hosting events like 
"tech-free" weekends, outdoor festivals, and group exercise classes can foster a sense 
of community and promote healthier lifestyles.
Employers can contribute by promoting a healthy work-life balance for their 
employees. Encouraging regular breaks, limiting after-hours emails, and promoting 


15wellness programs can help reduce digital fatigue and enhance overall productivity and 
job satisfaction.
By emphasizing these points, we can disconnect from excessive use of technology and 
instead connect more with the real world, ensuring that technology serves us rather 
than controls us.
