General Comment
I am  writing this to say that I am  against the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. AI steals from  real artists and rob them  out of jobs where
their talents can flourish. AI should never m ake the talents of real people obsolete, especially when the AI's work is never truly there own
to begin with. I do not want Am erica to becom e the leader in AI technology and to m ake AI itself m ore powerful and dangerous for real
people. Hard work and talent should be done by real people, not an AI that can only m im ic others. That is why I am  against the Artificial
Intelligence Action Plan and request that this law is never accepted.
