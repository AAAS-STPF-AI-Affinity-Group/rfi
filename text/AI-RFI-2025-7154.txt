General Comment
I am  noting m y strong rejection of an AI Action Plan, especially a plan that shields AI com panies from  the harm  they do via this
technology. Generative AI consum es a high am ount of electricity and water to produce m ediocre, flattened, and averaged copies of
hum an-created work. Along with its unethical training process that steals copyrighted work, this technology does not fill needs other than
creating a new m arket for certain com panies. Stop giving preferential treatm ent to this harm ful technology.
