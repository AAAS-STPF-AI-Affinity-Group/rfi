General Comment
Millions of creatives around the globe rely on art across m ultiple m edium s for their livelihood. To take their work without their perm ission
and without com pensation, and use it to then create new "works" so that shareholders and com panies (who already m ake hundreds of
thousands of dollars or m ore a year) even m ore m oney that they do not need. Meanwhile, tens of thousands go hom eless and starve.
AI could be a powerful tool but as it is being im plem ented now, it is financially, socially, and environm entally destructive for m illions of
people. All AI m odels m ust be built upon data for which the creators have fairly paid.
