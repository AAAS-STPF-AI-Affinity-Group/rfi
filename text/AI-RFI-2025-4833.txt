General Comment
AI runs on the sam e ideologies of a cancer cell and a robber baron. It is a disgusting, thieving, gluttonous m ess of overhyped garbage run
by con artists which wants to take the soul of hum anity and turn it into grey blobby slop, stealing art from  the people, and force us to serve
as feudal serfs solely in hard labor.
AI should be taking care of tasks like production lines and laundry. It should not be stealing writing, m usic, and visual art. And that is what
the foul, soulless goons at OpenAI want.
