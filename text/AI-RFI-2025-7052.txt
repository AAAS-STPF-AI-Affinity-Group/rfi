General Comment
If we are not pursuing "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Developm ent and Use of Artificial Intelligence" then we shouldn't be doing it at all.
It is crucial that the developm ent of AI be done in consultation with groups like https://www.dair-institute.org/ and https://www.hum ane-
intelligence.org/ to ensure that it is used reliably and responsibly.
We also have to do what we can to m inim ize the clim ate im pacts that the m assive increase in energy consum ption of AI is causing :

If we don't address these issues as well, we will only be creating further disaster. Not to m ention the ways in which AI m odels have
benefited from  stealing content from  everyone online. Which also needs to be stopped.
