General Comment
Generative AI is rife with ethical issues and is a net negative for society. At m inim um , it should be better regulated. Since the tech cannot
be put back in Pandora's proverbial box, it should be treated like the threat to social order and real hum an livelihood that it is. It harm s
education, entertainm ent, it is riddled with sim ple errors and incorrect answers. It is a Disinform ation Agent's greatest asset, and it floods
our Internet with falsehoods and im m aterial junk.
Uncontrolled, it can do serious dam age to hum anity. Please take action accordingly.
