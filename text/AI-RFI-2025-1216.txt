General Comment
Cannot stress enough the need for a true open source AI so dedicated team s can help guide accurate data and algorithm  use for training
the AI and overcom e the clear bias found in m assive MSM and social m edia m aterial not to m ention the real risk of m anipulated outcom es
m ade to look accurate but are intentionally false and/or fabricated. This will also help ensure privacy concerns are m anaged in a healthy
way
Also need som e safety m easures and/or ability to unplug or otherwise turn off an AI that goes rogue and becom es a threat to persons, our
country and hum anity
