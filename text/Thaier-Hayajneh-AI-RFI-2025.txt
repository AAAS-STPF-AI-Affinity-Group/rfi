Introduction To ensure U.S. leadership in AI, we must establish strong foundational pillars, 
starting with early AI education, workforce development, and strategic research investments. AI 
is rapidly advancing, and the U.S. must prepare students early to d evelop the skills necessary to 
compete with other nations and lead in AI innovation. The following policy actions are critical to 
achieving this goal. Priority Policy Actions for AI Education & Workforce Development 1. Early 
AI Education as a National Prio rity Develop a standardized AI curriculum in K -12 education, 
ensuring students gain foundational AI, machine learning, and computational thinking skills. 
Expand AI literacy programs in elementary and middle schools, integrating AI concepts into 
math, scien ce, and technology education. Launch federal AI teacher training programs, 
equipping educators with the necessary knowledge and resources to teach AI effectively. 
Encourage public -private partnerships to provide AI learning resources, mentorship programs, 
and hands -on AI labs in schools. 2. AI Workforce Readiness & Global Competitiveness 
Implement AI apprenticeships and industry collaborations to transition students from academic 
learning to real -world AI applications. Establish federal AI upskilling initia tives, particularly 
cybersecurity, data science, and ethical AI governance. Create a national AI talent pipeline, 
ensuring a diverse, skilled workforce ready to compete in the global AI landscape. Priority 
Policy Actions for AI Research & Development 3. St rategic AI Investments for U.S. Leadership 
Increase funding for ethical AI research, including bias reduction, explainable AI (XAI), and 
adversarial AI defense mechanisms. Support AI research in cybersecurity applications, focusing 
on fraud detection, thre at intelligence, and national security. Establish federal AI innovation hubs 
to accelerate AI development in key sectors such as healthcare, defense, and finance. 4. National 
AI Security & Infrastructure Protection Strengthen AI -driven cybersecurity soluti ons, ensuring 
the protection of critical infrastructure and sensitive data. Implement a federal AI risk assessment 
framework, ensuring AI applications align with national security priorities. Enhance U.S. AI 
competitiveness through strategic partnerships w ith academia, government, and industry. 
Conclusion To establish the U.S. as a global AI leader, we must invest in early AI education, 
workforce development, and cutting -edge research. By building the foundational pillars of AI 
literacy, security, and innov ation, we can ensure the U.S. remains the leading nation of AI 
advancement.
