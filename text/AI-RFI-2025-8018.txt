General Comment
There is no place for artificial intelligence in the present, m uch less the future of the US. You know why? Because the energy it takes to
run artificial "intelligence" is resource-heavy to the point of being environm entally destructive. 
AI is not "intelligent," it is a plagiarism  cespool of unoriginal thought that offers no im provem ent to the quality of life of the Am erican public.
Why are you planning on feeding lim ited, valuable resources to som ething so stupid it cannot differentiate between a page of text vs a page
of text in colum ns? Any literate 8-yr-old can do this, but ai cannot. 
Since the existence of child labor laws isn't stopping you from  hiring 8-yr-olds, then what is? Is it their undeveloped ability to critically
think or plan? Because ai cannot do those things either, but an 8-yr-old is m ore creative and innovative than those dum b plagiarism
m achines who, even with thousands of years of hum an creativity fed into them  for the past decade, **STILL** can't create original work.
