General Comment
AI has, poorly, taken the jobs of m illions of Am ericans.
We didn't need poorly-coded copycat program s to m ake Am erica great before - and we don't need them  now.
Our country has incredibly talented artists, writers, engineers, scientists, and financial gurus - we don't need AI, we need Am erican
Intelligence.
