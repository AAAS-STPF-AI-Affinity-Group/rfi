General Comment
Generative AI is founded on theft and infringes upon copyrights of individuals, corporations and everyone in-between. There is no
creativity involved with generative AI and no value in its existence, being a waste of tim e, resources, and energy and adverse to the
foundations of artistry going back m ore than 2000 years. Furtherm ore, Generative AI is sim ply a ploy for com panies to be able to reduce
workforces, triggering a nationwide, potentially global, unem ploym ent spike and further underm ining any attem pts at uplifting the m iddle
and lower classes. 
There is no two ways about it: Generative AI should not exist. The above reasons are only the consequences we are aware of at this tim e.
There are so m any potential pitfalls and dangers associated with this grift of a technology that we do not know about. OpenAI, generative
AI, AI infrastructure should not stand.
