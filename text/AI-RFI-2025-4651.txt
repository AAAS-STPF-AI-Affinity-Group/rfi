General Comment
Under no circum stances should any apparatus, AI or otherwise, be allowed to circum vent the rights of creators to use their content
without perm ission or com pensation. AI represents an attem pt by tech com panies to legalize theft under the guise of national security and
tech developm ent and is woefully under regulated. The governm ent should be drafting legislation to protect creator's copyright from  AI,
not carving out exceptions for it. If AI com panies want to use the content from  creators, they should have to acquire perm ission via a
license with due m onetary com pensation.
