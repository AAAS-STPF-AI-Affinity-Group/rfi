General Comment
If this country truly cared about efficiency and saving m oney, we would not be spending a single dim e on m achines that require every law
to be broken to function, and who's only purported purpose is to put thousands out of work. Any plan for this "technology" is worth a
fraction of a fraction of the cost of the paper it is written on.
