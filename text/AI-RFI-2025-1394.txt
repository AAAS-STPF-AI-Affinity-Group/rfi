General Comment
I’m  going to m ake this quick. This is a terrible idea. Gen AI com panies like OpenAI and Midjourney have trained their program s off of art
stolen from  artists as well as words written by writers and others. Stop this at once. You are m aking a m istake. The people don’t like it,
it’s bad for the m edia, it’s bad for the environm ent, this stuff has already lost com panies billions and billions of dollars. If you want
Trum p’s approval rating to drop even m ore, this proposal is how you do it. No one wants this. The governm ent has no business shoving
AI in our faces. Stop it stop it stop it. This will not cause good things to happen. This is evil. Plus Gen AI generated m aterial looks
absolutely horrendous and feels m ore lifeless than a corpse.
