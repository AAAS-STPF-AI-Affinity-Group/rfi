General Comment
Protect the rights of Am erican creatives from  predatory Generative AI com panies. Generative AI operates by stealing the work of artists
and authors without com pensation or perm ission, scanning it for patterns, and replicating those patterns through an algorithm . It cannot
function without m assive copyright infringem ent and theft of intellectual property. It is a m assive, m assive risk to privacy and security.
From  large creators like Hollywood and m usic studios to individual independent artists, everyone's work is currently being stolen and used
to m ake a lower-quality product that attem pts to replace them  in their line of work. No consent is being given, and requests to have one's
data exem pted from  scraping are routinely ignored. Any laws passed that involve generative AI MUST include restrictions on scraping
and on training that require AI com panies to get consent from  and provide com pensation to the original, hum an authors or artists of any
data they wish to use to train their AI. This is the dem and of the Am erican people: keep our creators safe. Do not sell the people of our
great nation out. Additionally, it m ust be legally required of anyone posting or selling AI-generated content that they clearly label it as such,
and pretending that AI-generated content is hum an-m ade should be considered fraud.
