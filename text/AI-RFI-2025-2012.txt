General Comment
I feel that allowing AI to use m aterials without copyright reduces the power of the sm all business owners and independent creative behind
each work. The governm ent should NOT be able to regulate what AI can do, this should be the power of the PEOPLE. By passing this
we are no better than com m unist dictators. Please reject this proposal as there are m any alternatives to training AI that don't involve the
dissolution of Am erican citizen freedom s!
