General Comment
As an artist, creator, com puter technician, and person who has experim ented with existing AI m odels, i have rather specific insight on AI
and how it im pacts both sm all and big artists. AI is little m ore than a plagiarism  blender. AI can and will harm  all art and entertainm ent
industries, sm all and large alike, if it is allowed to continue on its current path. AI should never be im m une to copyright issues, as the only
way an AI can understand a copyrighted entity, is if it was initially fed into its training m odel.
