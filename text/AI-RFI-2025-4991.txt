General Comment
The usage of this A.I is an infringem ent on people's rights as creators whose hard work is uncredited and stolen for som e else's profit.
There is a reason we have copyright laws in place and it is to protect people just from  that. Also, A.I such as this is a speculative m arket
just waiting to pop and thus dangerous to the econom y.
