General Comment
Rem oving protections to allow the growth of generative AI is unethical & harm ful. Replacing hum an work with AI will degrade the quality
of inform ation, artwork, & technology at large. Generative AI requires the work of hum ans to train, why would we try to rem ove hum ans
from  the process? This plan should not pass.
