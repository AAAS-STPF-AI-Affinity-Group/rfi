General Comment
The plan developers m ust seek substantial, ongoing input from  the disabled com m unity - particularly those who use or could benefit from
assistive technology, disability advocates, higher education assistive technology professionals (such as Alternative Media Specialists), and
experts in creating accessible technology. Incorporating input from  public com m ents from  people of these fields is helpful, but is not
enough. It is necessary to invite people from  the groups referenced above as m em bers of the plan developm ent team , in order to ensure
the plan does not unintentionally exclude or discrim inate against the disabled com m unity. Som e recom m endations for where to solicit
qualified individuals to join the team : 
(1) The Disabled Students Program s and Services (DSPS) offices of State Chancellor's Offices for com m unity colleges and universities.
(2) AHEAD - Association on Higher Education and Disability.
(3) State-level higher education/disability organizations such as CAPED - California Association for Postsecondary Education and
Disability.
(4) National-level organizations for specific disabilities, such as NAD - National Association of the Deaf; ABF - Am erican Foundation for
the Blind; LDA - Learning Disabilities Association of Am erica; NCLD - National Center for Learning Disabilities; NAMI - National
Alliance on Mental Illness; etc.
