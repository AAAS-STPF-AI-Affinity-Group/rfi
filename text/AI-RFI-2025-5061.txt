General Comment
I've seen the dam age that AI has done to artists, anim ators, writers, creators in general. I have friends and fam ily m em bers who are
aspiring artists, and are afraid that they will not be able to have jobs, or careers in the future, due to being replaced by AI. This needs to
be stopped.
