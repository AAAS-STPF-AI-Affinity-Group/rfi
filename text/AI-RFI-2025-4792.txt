General Comment
I do not believe AI to be beneficial to our country, our industries, or hum anity as a whole. Generative AI is built off of m aterial hard
working Am ericans have labored to create. It profits from  theft and explicitly does not com pensate for any m aterial used in training AIs.
It’s in blatant opposition to copyright, which m any business and industries use to protect their works and creations. It’s a m arket with
dim inishing returns and lim ited use, and I believe any funding spent on AI is a waste of resources. The funds could go to dozens of other
projects and industries and see far m ore value and use than it would going into AI. I sincerely hope that Open AI is not given the m eans to
realize their goals, and I hope our governm ent places its focus on m ore im portant industries and projects than AI.
