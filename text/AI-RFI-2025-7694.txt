General Comment
AI is a thing that takes away the livelihoods of working Am ericans while also destroying the planet we live on. I do not believe it has a
place in the US when it creates a cultural environm ent where people do not know if the things they are looking at are real or not. People
including m yself want genuine experiences which AI does not provide.
