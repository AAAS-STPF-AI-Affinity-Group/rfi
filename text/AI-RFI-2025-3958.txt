General Comment
AI is an environm ent destroying m achine built on theft and plagiarism  that does not deserve the governm ent's attention or m oney. There
are far m ore im protant things to be focused on than seeing if these useless, resource draining data centers can produce even a m odicum  of
useful inform ation. Search results are often incorrect or based on lies. So called "art" is ugly, incoherent, and eye-rollingly bad. The text it
produces is inhum an and only fit for the driest of em ails to other bots that will sum m arize them  into garbage. Drop this ridiculous chain of
thought and fund things that are actually im portant, like libraries, m useum s, and other form s of art that hum ans create. This is a waste of
tim e.
