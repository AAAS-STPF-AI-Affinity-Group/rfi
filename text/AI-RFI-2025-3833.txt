General Comment
AI steals from  the livelihoods of m illions of Am ericans in im portant artistic and creative fields without credit or com pensation for the use of
their work. AI is overhyped, predatory, and a scam  that is fleecing the Am erican public. AI steals both jobs and m aterials from  the
Am erican people. AI also poses num erous significant environm ental threats, particularly with regards to water usage and energy
consum ption. I strongly do not believe that AI has a place in the future of the United States.
