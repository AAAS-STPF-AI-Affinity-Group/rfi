General Comment
AI/Generative AI will be the end of everything in term s of creative freedom  and hum an ingenuity. Legalizing wide scale theft for big
business sake will be one of the very first steps in the beginning of true death of the Am erican dream . It will kill the arts, it will kill freedom
of expression, and it will slowly kill off other industries. This is not progress, this is one of the worst large scale grifting schem es ever
conceived that has dangerous consequences that will be felt for years to com e by m ultiple generations.
