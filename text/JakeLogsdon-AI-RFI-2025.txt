My name is Jake Logsdon. AI is technology built on theft. Corporations train their models offof work stolen from hard working Americans, and even if it was useful, that is unacceptableand should not be a part of this country's future. AI is a bubble based on tech that doesn't existthat is being used to threaten American's jobs and livelihoods. Corporate bullying of theworking class is not something the government should endorse. It is used to cut artists out ofthe process of making art directly by ripping off their work. It's filth and it has no placeanywhere but the garbage.
