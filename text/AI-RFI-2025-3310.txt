General Comment
Over the past several years, the tech industry as a whole has proven willing to con and abuse people across the world again and again.
From  crypto rug pulls to NFTs to the m uch older act of gutting services in the nam e of m aking them  appear m ore profitable in the m onths
leading up to a sale, they have shown them selves to be entirely untrustworthy with the level of power and control they currently wield.
AI is m erely the latest of a long string of technologies that fail to deliver on their prom ises, or fail to serve any purpose at all. The idea that
we would not only allow them  to continue on their current course, but em power them  by gutting the protections of people's intellectual
property, is unconscionable.
