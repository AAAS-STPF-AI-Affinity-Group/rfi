I am writing regarding the supposed "Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan", and to voice my  
opposition to OpenAI's attempt to obtain immunity from lawsuits regarding its flagrant and serial violation of artists'  
rights. The AI companies are complaining about "unnecessarily burdensome" restrictions on their development?
How about the fact that they are a burden on our creativity and environment? I do not believe they or any other "AI"  
company or their snake oil technology holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from my livelihood and others  
as Americans and profits off of brazen theft. This technology is an overhyped and unwanted bubble and is being  
used to shamelessly fleece the American public. They must be stopped. It is not a matter of "National Security", or  
whatever other excuse they might employ. It is a question of the rights of American artists and citizens.
