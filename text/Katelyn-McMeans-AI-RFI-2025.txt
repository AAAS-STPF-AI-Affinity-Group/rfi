AI should not be able to take from creators without compensating and having contracts for
their work. AI is not human. It cannot be inspired. It brings nothing new to the table, no newinsights, no life experiences to add. It only takes, and mashes. People can read all the samematerial as AI, they can see all the same paintings, but people have lives outside of art. Theyhave friends and thoughts and parents and longings and opinions. They have embarrassmentsand fears and things computers cannot have on their own and cannot grasp. If someone createdart that was just a mash up of characters that exist in copyright it would be illegal. Lettingcomputers do this on a massive scale without permission should be illegal. It breaks the lawbut it also breaks the human contract of art, because art offers a take on the human experiencefor you to connect your human experience to. Both artist and observer must bring themselvesto the art. AI cannot do that. Do not let the arts turn into cheap knockoffs with only garbledregurgitations of humanity. Arts are vital and human.
