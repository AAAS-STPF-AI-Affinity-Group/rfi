General Comment
I do not believe that AI holds a place in our future, and I have great distaste for it as its m odels are based on the theft of non-consenting
Am erican creators, artists, writers, and m ore. AI is a sm okescreen with no m aterial value other than stealing other peoples' work, and
reproducing it at lower quality.
