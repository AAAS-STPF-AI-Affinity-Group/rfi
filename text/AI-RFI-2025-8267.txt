General Comment
Hello, I am  a student in Ohio about to enter psychological education. Generative AI concerns m e, given that it pulls inform ation from  the
Web with no real logic regarding reliable sourcing. This m eans m any of m y fellow students repeat false and inaccurate inform ation
uncritically on a regular basis. Whatâ€™s worse is that m any educators now seem  to be using Generative AI for their assignm ents and lesson
plans, norm alizing this behavior.
I fear that placing no restrictions on the AI industry will only ham per Am erican education and endanger the public good by creating a less-
inform ed populace.
