General Comment
It is im perative that copyright be preserved. Com panies like OpenAI claim  to need uniquely broad access to copyrighted works to
develop their products, but they're just after the right to take with im punity from  Am erican citizens, and use other's com m ercial works
without having to com pensate the owners in any way. The Chinese AI sector has seen enorm ous advancem ent in the past year without
any such uniquely perm issive access to copyrighted work. OpenAI and sim ilar com panies are sim ply lazy and looking for handouts,
lagging behind foreign AI sectors even when given m ore resources. 
Do not give the AI sector special carveouts or exceptions to established copyright law.
