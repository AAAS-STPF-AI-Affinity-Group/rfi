General Comment
I am  a writer and artist who has fam iliarized m yself with AI. While it can be a great tool in m any cases, such as running routine scientific
searches or writing repetitive coding, in creating new works it has proven tim e and tim e again to be a disaster. Many of the "papers" it has
produced have been inaccurate, leading people to incorrect and often dangerous conclusions about science, health, and a num ber of
topics. It hasn't developed the ability to tell a lie from  the truth. That is som ething a m achine isn't capable of right now. 
In the artistic field, it feeds on copyrighted work from  m any of today's great m inds to regurgitate item s that lack any sort of creativity while
not paying hom age to the work it stole from . All of this is while using a disproportionate am ount of energy and water. It has no place in the
arts and certainly has no place in our governm ent where the decisions m ade are often life or death for the inhabitants of this country. 
Thank you.
