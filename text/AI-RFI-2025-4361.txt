General Comment
I do not believe that Ai holds a place in the future of entertainm ent or the free m arket. While it can be utilized to m ass-produce m edia and
utilized for corporations to m ake m ore m oney, it will hurt the citizens in the long-run. Specifically artists who were previously hired to
work within the entertainm ent industry. This technology lifts from  their own work, and utilizes it unknowingly in order to train m odels that
are a plague on the environm ent. None of the artists who were scraped have consented to their work being taken from  them , and those
who have were forced to do so retroactively.
Giving Ai corporations free reign over the ability to copyright Ai spits in the face of the com m on artist who worked to gain the skills which
they have presently. The sm all artists who m ake their livelihood off of their work. It cheapens the value of art, and therefore our culture as
Ai cannot create works of proper m eaning. All it does is flood websites and forces a user-base who already dislikes it to engage with it.
