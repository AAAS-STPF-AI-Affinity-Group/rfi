General Comment
Lets not bail out the com panies that already stole copyrighted content. Who are now in litigation regarding their m isdeeds. If they get to
m ine other creators work effort and property for free, that is the equivalent of theft. You don't get to walk into a bakery and steal al the
produce and called it "fair use". You don't steal a factory's steel beam s, and call it fair use. This is a direct attack on an individuals right to
property and the right to earn a living through the fruits of their labor. 
This is sham efully greedy by these m ega corporation. And governm ent would be selling out the people they are supposed to protect and
represent.
