General Comment
The way ram pant use of AI has been ruining the potential careers and passions of artists and other creatives is sham eful. No person
should ever have their creativity in a work environm ent stunted, nor should they have to worry about being harassed, doxxed, sent death
threats and m ore that I've seen artists have to endure because of the way this has been operating and advancing over the last several
years.
It has to be regulated so that people don't have to fear their careers falling apart or fear pursuing a career if they feel they can accom plish it
just because they don't feel secure in the fact that any person could steal their work and upload it to a program .
It is sham eful that this has even m ade it this far unregulated. You have m ade the lives and careers of m any wonderfully creative people so
m uch harder and uncertain because you did not step up to protect them , and now you're trying to m ake it even worse for these people.
Absolutely sham eful, and I hope for their sakes that you do not pass this plan.
