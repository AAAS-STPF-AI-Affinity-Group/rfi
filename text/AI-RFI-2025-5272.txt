General Comment
AI is a powerful tool and therefore m ust be regulated with safeguards for the public. AI tools have been built with stolen data, use
excessive energy resources, generate dangerously incorrect inform ation, and m ake it easier for crim inals to create scam s to target the
vulnerable. 
Any plan regarding AI should prioritize hum an intelligence, knowledge, creativity, and safety; value hum an labor; and protect our
environm ent and natural resources. 
Thank you.
