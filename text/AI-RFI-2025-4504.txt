General Comment
AI has been proven to be a m edia of plagiarism , theft, and m isinform ation. People trust it less, as they should, as it hurts every aspect of
society. Stolen art m ay not be as cared about as it should; but every person in this country and beyond are only going to be harm ed by the
reckless advancem ent of the power of current AI. The econom ic repercussions of this; let alone the effect that will be felt on preservation
of the truth, are so im m ense that any person who values the present and the future should not allow it to pass.
