General Comment
The intellectual properties of writers, m usicians, and artists m ust be protected. Copyright law exists so these artists can benefit from  their
years of dedicated practice and refining of their skills. Generative LLM AI does not generate truly new m aterial. It regurgitates already
existing m aterial into a crude facsim ile without m eaning. If a person does this then they are liable to be sued for copyright infringem ent.
Why should a LLM AI m odel not be subjected to that sam e scrutiny? AI can only be helpful to people if it is heavily regulated.
