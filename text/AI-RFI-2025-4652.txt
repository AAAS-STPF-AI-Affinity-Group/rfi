General Comment
Am erica should never be allowing theft. This country stands for an individual's rights, and that should be overwritten for the "rights" of a
big com pany. AI stealing inform ation from  individuals and sm all businesses should never be legal, this will not help anyone but the
com pany behind the generative AI. Do NOT let this country becom e a safe haven for thieves in suits!
