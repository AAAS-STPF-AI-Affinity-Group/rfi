General Comment
Generative A.I., and the way that billionaire investors have sold it to o ur government, is a sca m. It is, at its core, nothing more than an  
advanced p lagiarism machine, stea ling the work of ot her human be ings and regurgitating it en masse. To allow it to tra in freely on a ll of the 
creative material publicly available is not only a clear violation of U.S. cop yright law, it is a violation of t he dignity of a ll Americans who 
create a nd share art. At a time when tech o ligarchs like Zuckerberg a nd Altman are e xtracting ever more from hardworking Americans, 
while lobbying our government to do less for us in return, they now seek to rob Americans of the very art t hey prod uce to escape t hat 
reality. To hell with them. Not o nly should the U.S. government block a ny requests from b ig tech to grant them unchecked a uthority to 
steal o ur intellectual property for their plagiarism machines, they should actively regulate the industry a nd estab lish, in law and in regulation, 
that training LLMs on cop yrighted material is no different than plagiarizing that material outright. If Open A.I. wants to use our art, o ur 
writing, they can do what any other party would have to â€” ask us, and then pay us. 
F&^% Altm an, f&^% open A.I., and f&^% the ol igarchs who want to steal our art for their prof it. They've already stolen 
everyth ing else; don't  let them steal th is to.
