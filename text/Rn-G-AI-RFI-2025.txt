I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of America.
After reading through this, I sincerely do not believe that "sustaining and enhancing America'sAI dominance" would successfully promote "human flourishing, economic competitiveness,and national security."Lifting restrictions on AI and improving its dominance wouldn't solve the problems we face inour every day lives, let alone solve what you "claim" to seek to achieve by doing this.Something like this will put creators and organizations that heavily depend on creative andcopyright laws into extreme danger as well as their livelihoods.Consider this me officially and completely opposing this Development of the ArtificialIntelligence (AI) Action Plan as well as similar plans.
