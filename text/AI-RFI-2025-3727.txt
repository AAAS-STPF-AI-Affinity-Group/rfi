General Comment
AI should not be exem pt from  copyright protections as the action plan would suggest, as it steals from  other people’s creative works in
order to train its algorithm . Copyright exists to protect artists and creators alike from  having their work essentially be stolen by other
people’s or corporate entities, and it is with these existing protections in m ind, they should not im plem ent this action plan.
