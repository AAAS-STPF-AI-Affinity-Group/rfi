 is extremely unacceptable and unappealing. There have been many instances of
my fellow artists being accused of AI with  little to no proof, and these claims have put their
creative careers at risk, if not jeopardizing it entirely. Many use their creative works as ameans of income, a means that AI can entirely uproot,
 due to its  nature and many not wanting
to support  it in a creative  space. Ai art takes away the integrity of art, and insults its meaning
as a whole. Art is something YOU create, not something  you can just ask a robot to make for
you. As some may have already mentioned, there is a very exploitable loophole present. If thecopyright and trademark laws become less lenient, then other places can feed their own AI's toaccess America's data and intellectual property, putting the U.S at huge risk. AI should beused in favor of us and what we
 struggle  to achieve, not against us and our aspirations and
livelihood.
