General Comment
"but following copyright law is haaaaaaaaaaaaard" isn't an excuse any other industry can get away with, and yet we're supposed to buy it
from  AI com panies because their visual-hallucination m achines are just SOOOOO im portant? Gim m e a break, they aren't that special and
they shouldn't get any kind of exception to laws.
If their technology is THAT am azing, THAT im portant, THAT revolutionary, THAT profitable, they can pay to license works like
everyone else is supposed to. There's not supposed to be a "but you have to let m e break the law, the thing I'm  doing is cool!" exception.
