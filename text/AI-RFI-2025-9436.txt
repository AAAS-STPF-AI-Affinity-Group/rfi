General Comment
Destroying copyright would not only rob average people and professional artists of their own copyrights, but would destroy the copyright
of corporations the seek to profit from  this very thing. Any short term  gains would be wiped out from  the destruction of the various
industries that rely on creative work and workers that would be effected by being replaced by AI. Our econom y, already in downturn,
would plum m et further from  these losses. There is no am ount of stolen data that will m ake AI into the prom ised product these snake oil
salesm en are selling. 
Defend us! Defend our ability to m ake art and own it, whether we're an individual or corporation. Do not let these com panies steal from
us what we have m ade!
