General Comment
As an individual who is supportive and adjacent to the tech industry, constant innovation is necessary. Advancem ents should not com e
from  sacrificing privacy and personal boundaries of individual Am ericans. The United States needs to be protecting its citizens, it's
foundation, and it's future from  threats, both foreign and dom estic. Allowing AI to use any and all inform ation with restrictions or guardrails
is opening up our country to expose state secrets and setting up to becom e vulnerable sitting ducks to be pillaged and plundered by other
nations who wish to do us harm . Keep our country and our citizens protected by allowing us to m aintain a level of privacy and authority
over our own data.
