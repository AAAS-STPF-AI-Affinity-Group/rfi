General Comment
I am  the Associate Director for the Global AI Frontier Lab at NYU. International cooperation and exchange for AI research is crucial, as
dem onstrated by m any critical international cooperative discoveries throughout recent history. In an increasingly isolationist international
landscape, it is im perative that the United States continues to recognize com parative scientific strengths throughout the world, and utilize
our alliances and global partnerships to bolster our scientific ecosystem s and enhance our AI capabilities. The wealth of potential
applications for the nascent AI field will only benefit from  a broad set of perspectives and inputs, and international partnership and
exchange am ong U.S. research institutions has a proven track record for success.
