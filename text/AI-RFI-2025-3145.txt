General Comment
I believe it is im portant to protect the rights of the individuals and organizations that create art. Using their work to train AI without
perm ission and/or com pensation will dam age the artist com m unity irreparably. Artists can only exist with enough com pensation that they
can live, and AI taking their work to regurgitate som ething else will eventually harm  everyone involved--The artist first, then the AI itself,
regurgitating its own prom pts at an unsustainable rate. I know the issue is m uch bigger than just this one concern. As an artist m yself,
though, that point is som ething that m atters to m e in particular.
