The government has been seized by white supremacists, their wealth shielding them from 
accountability as they dismantle the very institutions mean to serve the people. The billionaire 
class, led by Trump and his enablers, are looting the country in broad d aylight, cutting vital jobs, 
gutting essential programs, and consolidating power with impunity. The voices of the American 
people are ignored, our rights dismantled for the benefit of the wealthy few. They are no longer 
pretending. They are no longer hidin g their white hoods. The white supremacists are in the White 
House, and they are waging war on the most vulnerable among us. If this continues, we will no 
longer need to ask how fascism takes hold because we will be living it. This is not the nation we 
claim to be, we must scream from the rooftops that we will not accept this. Also, only slightly more 
than 30% of Americans voted for Trump. That means 60% did NOT get his vote. His agenda does not 
represent the will of all Americans, not even close.
