General Comment
I work in IT. I regularly deal with com puter, files, and m aintenance on those system s. I've worked with legal firm s, realtors, police
departm ents, city governm ents, printers, fabricators, welders, m echanics, librarians, taxiderm ists, restaurants, m arketers, artists,
photographers, writers, and countless other sm all businesses as well as private citizens.
Not a single one of them  has carte blanche rights to access and use anyone else's data without well defined processes.
In m y work, I've also seen the dam age unregulated and unrestrained Large Language Models and other AI system s have done. My own
job is far m ore difficult with these system s, with no regard for quality, inserting their output in to m y research. Instead of finding solutions
from  other "com puter nerds" like m yself, I'm  wading through pages of AI generated garbage all trained on the sam e incorrect data.
Not only does the data fed in to it need to be to the sam e regulatory standards as everyone else - that is, the copyright holder has given
explicit perm ission to allow the use - the com plete lack of regulation of the content m eans the output ranges from  useless to dangerous,
with the potential for loss of life.
I am  an adult, I've been around a bit, I like to think I can tell good inform ation from  bad, and I check inform ation from  m ultiple sources.
Most ten year olds don't.
Children will die if this isn't reigned in, if they haven't already.
