General Comment
I don't want art like m ine and others stolen by corporations that have m ore m oney than I'll ever have in m y lifetim e. It's unconsturional,
unfair, and im m oral that whatever I m ake for fun or for m y own profit will be stolen from  m e without m y knowledge or consent. I have
little to nothing in this life and the one thing that m akes m e feel hum an and alive (creating), and knowing people who don't know m e wants
to steal from  m e is incredibly unsettling, disgusting, and outright unlawful.
