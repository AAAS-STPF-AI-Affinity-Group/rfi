ChatGPT can barely handle giving people correc t information as is (w hich is why it’s a langua ge 
model and not an information model) and the only reason for developing it is to steal REAL jobs. 
Guess what? AI can’t remove invasive species, or cut down timber on federal lands. AI isn’t 
comprehensive enough to be trusted to do taxes, nor do Americans want their tax information fed 
into an AI generator. The federal government will use AI to spread government propaganda. $%
@! off.
