General Comment
I don't believe generative AI has a future in Am erica and should not be supported and given free reign like this. Major com panies are
already starting to pull back their AI integration because it is expensive and extrem ely resource intensive to run, while also being generally
unpopular with the consum er.
It is a waste of m oney. And resources to power it.
It will be a m assive waste of tax payer m oney to support this industry.
Please set this action plan aside and focus on providing m eaningful relief to the Am erican citizen who are struggling to m ake ends m eet.
Struggling to keep their children fed.
