General Comment
What OpenAI intends to do is a flagrant violation of existing US copyright laws- giving them  im m unity for "AI" technology is not the path
forward. AI training data m ust be ethically sourced from  sources which have given explicit perm ission, not scraped from  copyrighted
m aterial.
