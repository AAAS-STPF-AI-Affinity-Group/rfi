Hello,We need to accelerate AI to the greatest extent possible so that humanity can finally achieve
breakthroughs in the notoriously slow-moving medical field. Every day that AI is delayed results inthousands of lives lost to cancer and other diseases that AI can find a cure for. We should give tax breaksto companies involved in chip design, chip manufacturing, or AI to speed up progress, and we need toremove all copyright restrictions on medical and scientific texts so that they can be used to train AI. Thecure for cancer shouldn't be behind a paywall.
