General Comment
AI com panies should not be perm itted to train their m odels or program s on copyrighted content. AI com panies profit off of their m odels
and are m arketing them  as com petition for professional writers, and therefore training AI on copyrighted works is not fair use. It is theft of
people's rightful property. If a com pany wants to exist, it has to be able to pay it's costs, and AI is no exception. Also, AI is extrem ely
unreliable and a poor investm ent. Violating our laws for broken, inefficient, ineffective program s like AI is a fool's position. Make them
prove them selves on the open m arket first for real instead of giving them  a handout by letting them  cheat authors out of their copyrighted
work.
