General Comment
Generative AI m odels absolutely m ust not be allowed to freely steal content from  across the internet. Getting the content creator’s
perm ission ahead of tim e, respecting copyright and intellectual property are very im portant in this country, why would these com panies
one’s get a pass? If they cannot afford to pay for the content they’re using they don’t deserve to m ake the AI.
