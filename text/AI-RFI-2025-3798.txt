General Comment
Absolutely not. Why does a business get a free pass to steal from  everyone's property, but everyone else would get arrested for such
behavior? The only ones who would benefit from  this is Open AI and large corporations who already seek to look for reasons en m asse
to fire everyone in the nam e of giving m oney to shareholders. Copyrighted m aterial is there to protect the m ost vulnerable and giving it a
free pass opens up a can of worm s that eats everything and leaves nothing for others.
This is a terrible idea devoid of foresight and will even harm  other com panies whose only protections are their copyright protections. If
m ass people were and are punished by the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act, then why can't one com pany be held liable in the sam e way,
unless it's to support hypocrisy?
