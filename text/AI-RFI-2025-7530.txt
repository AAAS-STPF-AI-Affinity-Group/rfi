General Comment
AI Technology- and ESPECIALLY Generative AI technology, does not present a tangible benefit to the US, or any nation for that
m atter. It feeds off of the ingenuity, heart, soul, and intent of creations by hum an beings for its widespread theft, and is already being used
for excessively nefarious purposes. This is to say nothing of the resources wasted on this technology, whether it be energy, m aterials
(precious m inerals used for com ponents that allow the processing of generations), and real estate (for server farm s). All of these are things
that would be better suited to m ore im pactful advancem ents for our country and hum ankind. Allowing AI com panies to breach the
protections offered by copyright will inevitably lead to the stagnation of creativity, harm  m illions of people across the nation, as well as
cause m assive losses in revenue for tons of industries that rely on the ingenuity of hum an beings. Please do not let these com panies have
their way and send us beyond the point of no return.
