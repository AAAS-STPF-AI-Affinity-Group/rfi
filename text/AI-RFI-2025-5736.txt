General Comment
It's been said before by others, but this is a succinct sum m ary:
AI does not hold a place in the future of the US.
AI steals from  our livelihoods as Am erican creators and profits off of theft.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the resources of the Am erican public.
AI is a waste of energy, physically and em otionally.
AI devalues the legacy of inventiveness associated with Am ericans. Note I have to think on using "past legacy" to m ake the point how this
is poised to no longer be the case.
AI prom otes professional inaccuracy and lack of accountability and responsibility. If you think that that's a benefit, you need to ponder
your own uselessness.
