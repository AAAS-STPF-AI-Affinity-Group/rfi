General Comment
I do not think that Am y AI com pany should be allowed to train and thus profit from  copy written/tradem arked IP or anyone's work or
creations without express written perm ission from  the holder of those rights. This is propping up an over hyped tech bubble industry, with
Am erican assets for private gain. AI is not even that functional yet, even as it takes jobs it later needs hum an help to actually do.
