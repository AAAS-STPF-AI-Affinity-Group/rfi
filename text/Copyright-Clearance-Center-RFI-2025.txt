Response of Copyright Clearance Center to the Request for Information on the 
Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan.  
Introduction  
The strongest buildings need to be built on the best foundations. For AI systems to flourish, 
they need to be built on the best available content: content that has been validated, tagged, 
enriched and made machine ready. Fortunately, America’s leading publ ishers, collecting 
societies, and creators make such high -quality content available for AI licensing.  
We urge the OSTP to keep two key themes in mind as it develops its AI Action Plan. First, 
support for licensing and intellectual property at home and abroad are critical to defending 
the US creative sector’s contributions to US economic growth, job creatio n, and trade 
surplus and to the advancement of AI in the US. Second, governmental support for 
transparency obligations with respect to AI system development is necessary to enable and 
grow reliable AI systems for use by the US Government and US businesses while supporting 
intellectual property.  
About CCC  
With over forty-five years of expertise in copyright and information management, CCC 
designs and delivers innovative information solutions that power decision -making by helping 
people integrate and navigate data sources and content assets. We collaborate with our 
customers to accelerate discovery and progress by shortening the distance between data,

CCC was founded by publishers and users at the suggestion of Congress to facilitate 
copyright licensing for text during the time of the photocopy machine. We offer global 
corporate licensing on a fully voluntary, non -exclusive basis, plus academic licensin g 
services primarily within the United States. Most of the nation’s largest companies use our 
services. Our mission is to advance copyright, accelerate knowledge, and power innovation. 
CCC services include licensing, copyright education, library staffing, library and publisher 
software development, API development, persistent identifiers, and data/metadata services.

CCC supports AI in many ways. These include: our licensing and software solutions; 
collaborations with rightsholders, users and trade associations; ongoing development of 
persistent identifiers (PIDs), AI education, and support of FAIR data principles . Perhaps most 
importantly to this inquiry, we include AI rights in a number of licensing offerings, including 
our corporate annual copyright license , and we recently announced  the development of an 
external AI systems training license.  
We understand how important it is to help the AI journeys of users by enabling development 
of reliable and trustworthy AI systems  to further goals. We also understand how important it 
is to support rightsholders by ensuring adequate remuneration for their investments in the 
content that drives AI systems.  
Copyright and the US Economy  
The creative sector contributes to economic growth, employment, exports, and the digital 
economy. According to the most recent study , the total copyright industries added more 
than $2.9 trillion to the GDP, accounting for 12.52 percent of the US economy. In terms of our 
digital economy, the total copyright industries accounted for 52.26 percent of the US digital 
economy, contributing o ver 58.9 percent to the US digital economy employment. Copyright 
industries account for nearly 16.1 million workers, and the annual compensation paid to 
core copyright workers amounts to a 51 percent compensation premium over the average US 
annual wage. In  other words, these are good jobs.  
The sales of select US copyrighted products in overseas markets amounted to $230.3 billion 
in 2021, exceeding foreign sales of other major US industries such as agriculture.  
In its international engagement, the United States has led the way in calling for the 
protection of intellectual property, including copyright, in the context of AI. In the G7 for 
example, the Trump Administration was instrumental in driving key commitment s regarding 
IP protection in the digital environment. As the 2017 G7 ICT and Industry Ministers 
Declaration  underscored:  
…the role of intellectual property rights for promoting innovation, contributing to industry's 
productivity, growth and competitiveness in the digital economy and that IPR -intensive 
industries contribute more than other industries to increase GDP, employme nt and 
trade….The rise of IP infringements in the digital economy is of growing concern for 
governments, industries and consumers worldwide. Therefore, we recognize the need to 
have in place strong enforcement mechanisms for IP, including through internati onal 
collaboration, to the benefit of IP right holders engaged in both large and small businesses, 
in light of serious risk of economic loss stemming from IP infringement including

counterfeiting, piracy and misappropriation of trade secrets. [This includes the need to] 
strengthen capacity to protect and enforce intellectual property rights, also considering the 
impact of new digital technologies…  
Likewise, in 2018, the Trump Administration secured several critical commitments  from G7 
Leaders on AI including the need for effective protection and enforcement of IP. Thanks to 
these critical foundations, the G7 and other countries have continued to build on their 
commitments and other international fora to promote creators, protec t copyright and ensure 
transparency in the development, deployment and use of AI.  
Notably, in 2020 the Administration issued Artificial Intelligence for the American People , 
which consisted of five pillars. The fifth pillar, i.e., “AI with American Values,” reaffirmed the 
President’s commitment to protecting IP in the AI environment, stating “The United States 
has long been a champion and defender of the core values of freed om, guarantees of human 
rights, the rule of law, stability in our institutions, rights to privacy, respect for intellectual 
property, and opportunities to all to pursue their dreams. The AI technologies we develop 
must also reflect these fundamental Americ an values and our devotion to helping people.” 
Under this pillar, the Administration outlined its strategy for international leadership on AI 
consistent with the above values.  
AI Action Plan  
CCC is a member of the Copyright Alliance and supports its  detailed response to the OSTP 
Action Plan. In addition, we chose to amplify certain aspects of that response and herein 
add some relevant details.  
Global protection of U.S. intellectual property is imperative to ensuring U.S. economic 
competitiveness and sustained global leadership. Unfortunately, the development and 
deployment of generative artificial intelligence (“GAI”) in foreign markets has crea ted 
barriers to trade that put U.S. copyright owners at a disadvantage. These barriers are born 
out of (1) inadequate copyright laws, particularly where copyright owners are unable to fully 
exercise their rights; (2) inadequate and ineffective enforcement of existing copyright laws; 
and (3) market access barriers that inhibit the licensing and dissemination of copyrighted 
works.  
These barriers have increasingly arisen in the form of copyright exceptions for GAI, including 
exceptions for text and data mining (TDM), which is a base technology often used to train 
GAI. CCC has licensed text and data mining rights  on behalf of US and other publishers for 
more than a decade and we are directly impacted by these copyright exceptions.

Some countries (e.g., Singapore) have adopted broad exceptions for TDM that fundamentally 
weaken copyright protection and threaten the sustainability and competitiveness of 
America’s creative sector and its ability to contribute to U.S. economic growth and  job 
creation. Other countries, including the UK, are considering such exceptions with the 
express intention of luring jobs. In addition to harming U.S. creators and copyright owners, 
the adoption of such exceptions facilitates  the offshoring of the AI technology sector and 
expose vast amounts of data to foreign control, undermining American national security.  
We urge the Administration to champion the rights of American creators and copyright 
owners and support the protection of copyright globally through bilateral and multilateral 
engagement that advances human -centric and responsible GAI, promotes free market s and 
licensing, and ensures recordkeeping and transparency. We urge that any AI Action Plan 
includes opposition to foreign copyright exceptions for AI and TDM.   
Promoting Free Markets Through Copyright Licensing  
As mentioned above, CCC was founded to address licensing challenges arising from the 
photocopy machine. From then until now, we have been promoting free markets and a 
robust voluntary licensing ecosystem through fully voluntary, non -exclusive, market -driven 
licensing regimes.  
Copyright law enables creators and copyright owners to supply GAI companies with flexible 
and responsive solutions for training through tailored licensing and business models. CCC 
has added AI rights to our existing licenses for internal corporate reuse an d more recently 
announced the development of a collective license for external GAI systems training.  
The ability of creators and copyright owners to create works and enforce their rights in those 
works is crucial. It incentivizes the further creation and proliferation of high -quality creative 
and scientific works which form the basis for GAI development. Without copyrighted works, 
many GAI technologies cannot generate high -quality output.  
Since the rise of GAI technologies a few years ago, the number of licensing agreements  
between copyright holders and users has steadily increased. This shows that the market is 
working, and that copyright and GAI can continue to progress successfully together without 
changes to copyright law.  
No policy should be adopted by the US Government that interferes with this free market or 
the freedom to license. The marketplace should continue to properly value and incentivize 
creativity, and policies developed through the AI Action Plan should ensure the right of

copyright owners to choose wheth er to license, or not to license, their works for GAI 
purposes, and on what terms.  
The Need for Transparency 
CCC’s clients include the larges t US-based companies in fields as diverse as food, fuel, 
pharmaceuticals, finance, engineering, and aerospace. Through our work with these 
businesses, we know that high stakes AI applications require transparenc y of input. This is 
just another version of responsible supply chain management. The US Governm ent should 
not risk the securit y and health of its citizens by using AI systems developed wit h incomplete 
documentation.  
Adequate transparenc y regarding ingestion of works also helps ensure that copyright 
owners’ rights are respected. When developers of GAI models ingest copyrighted works 
owned by third parties without a license, they should be required t o satisfy transparency 
standards sufficient to enable creators t o know if their materials were used, and ho w they 
were used.  
Best practices already exist that enable users of AI systems or those affec ted by its outputs 
to know the provenance of those outputs. There is no reason these same responsibilities 
should not also apply to GAI ingestio n of copyrighted works. Any AI Action Plan should 
include reasonable transparenc y requirements. 
Conclusion 
It is essential that the AI Action Plan respects the rights of creators and copyright owners. 
Likewise, the AI Actio n Plan should improve AI reliabilit y, safety, security, and licensing 
through, among other things, transparenc y obligations. Finally, the U.S. economy should be 
secured b y the promotion, protection, and enforcement of copyright globally.
