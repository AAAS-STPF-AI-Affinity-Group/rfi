General Comment
This is blatantly hostile to skilled artists. Encouraging the use of generative AI encourages the stealing of labor; whether it be by training
these AI on artists' work to replicate without the application of skill or perm ission of the artist, or be it by replacing jobs in creative fields
with program s that m erely respond to prom pts without an understanding of what m akes art truly art. This plan appeals only to the egoistic
entrepreneur who thinks that AI is a get-rich-easy tool, and that paying artists fairly is an inconvenience.
