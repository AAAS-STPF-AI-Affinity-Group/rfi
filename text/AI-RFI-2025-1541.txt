General Comment
AI needs strong regulation and laws in place to even think about considering investm ent in AI. The last few years have been a m ess of
fake im ages, deepfaked porn, fake art, and fake audio. I have no faith in the adm inistration's ability to handle such a dangerous and
harm ful technology. Nothing has been done within the past few years and especially not the last few m onths. How can com panies protect
their IPs and Copyrights if anyone can fake im ages or leaks to m anipulate social m edia and the free m arket? The US is woefully
unprepared for such dangerous technology that they have greatly ignored until recently. This will ruin jobs, this will ruin lives, this will ruin
com panies, this will ruin this country.
I strongly oppose the use and adoption of AI as it's aspirations are built upon sheer greed and carelessness.
