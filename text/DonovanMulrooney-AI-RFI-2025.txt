Hello,
Iâ€™ve recently heard about the AI action plan and am personally concerned. I believe this
document will do harm and would like for it to not pass.  
On the greater subject of AI usage, I personally find it harmful to not just artists, but anyperson in general. It does not have the capacities that regular human artist have in creatingthings, and never will.

Have a good night,Donovan
