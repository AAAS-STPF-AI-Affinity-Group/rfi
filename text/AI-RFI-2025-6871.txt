General Comment
Benefiting and profiting off others' intellectual property without any form  of perm ission or com pensation is a form  of theft, one that will
severely hurt the livelihood of countless am ericans. It is unacceptable for the US goverm ent to allow com panies to steal other's property,
all in the nam e of furthering a technology that will in no way offset the dam age done to those affected by such theft. This Plan betrays the
principles this nation was built upon, and it threatens the stability of its econom y, its international reputation and the lives of its people.
