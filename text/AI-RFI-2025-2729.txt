General Comment
Generative AI technology as it exists today serves no purpose in aiding the US in any national security front. Right now it is a purely
exploitative technology being used by large tech corporations to replace workers and use creatives work without their perm ission to
essentially replace them  in the work force. Many countries including China recognize this and are looking for ways to regulate this
exploitation to m itigate harm , so should the US.
