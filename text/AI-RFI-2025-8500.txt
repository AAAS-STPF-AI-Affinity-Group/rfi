General Comment
AI is overhyped, inefficient, ineffective, wasteful, harm ful, and unethical. Generative AI in particular does not and cannot do the vast
m ajority of what the com panies building it and selling it say it can do, and it consistently costs far m ore to build and run than it is worth to
anyone, even though the AI com panies stole and continue to steal the work of m illions of people rather than pay fairly for the use of the
writing and im ages they train their m odels on. Do not throw away what protections artists and writers have to feed the AI beast that is
fleecing our society. We should be regulating AI com panies m ore strictly, not less, and hold them  accountable for their theft and
exploitation of the Am erican people and their em ployees and contractors around the world. We should require them  to pay for the work
they have stolen to train their m odels and stop using work they have not legitim ately licensed, pay their data workers fairly and provide
adequate psychological support, and require AI com panies to power their data centers with renewable energy and ensure they do not
deplete water supplies. We should require honesty in advertising - they m ust stop lying about the capabilities of the technology. We need
m ore and stronger guardrails around the developm ent of AI and its real, tangible harm s, not less.
