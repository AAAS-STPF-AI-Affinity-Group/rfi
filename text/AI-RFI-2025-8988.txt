General Comment
To do this would set a precedent that destroying countless jobs m eant for hum anity to pursue in the form s of art, m usic, and other creative
outlets is now the norm  and readily accepted by the governm ent. Machines were m ade to serve the people, not to further em power greed
by destroying the very creative outlets we were prom ised we would be able to spend m ore tim e pursuing while m achines toiled away at
m ore labourious work.
