General Comment
Allowing AI scrapers to steal the copyrighted work of hum an artists dim inishes the im portant contributions of Am erican artists to the
global cultural conversation. AI "art" will never be as m oving, nor as profitable, as the work of real hum an artists. This plan will further
im poverish hardworking AMERICAN ARTISTS while only creating m ore m ilquetoast drivel that isn't even worth the energy required for
the scrapers to m ake it. Please don't treat artists like this. They are what m ake our country great.
