To whom it may concern:
I oppose the use and expansion of AI on grounds of national security, theft of
ideas and labor, technology security, and market vulnerability. AI makesAmericans less safe at home and abroad, including deployed military. It destroysjobs in creative and tech sectors. Because it is prone to errors, it will causeexpensive coding issues that will lose corporations and individuals money. AI hasthe potential to destabilize entire economies.
Instead of seeing it as a panacea, we must envision the many ways it can ruin
companies and families and establish failsafes before unleashing it further.
Thank you.
