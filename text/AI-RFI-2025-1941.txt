General Comment
As an artist, I find the idea that the governm ent wishes to rem ove what little protections there are against generative AI's plagiarism  and
environm ental harm  extrem ely concerning. The governm ent will be de-incentivizing Am erican innovation and progress in creative fields,
actively taking away jobs, and harm ing the towns that house the com puters that run generative AI if it rem oves what m eager protections
exist to prevent these greedy, im m oral generative AI com panies from  harm ing our country. Instead, the governm ent should be im posing
m ore lim itations on these com panies. If the generative AI industry in the USA were to die, it could only be a good thing. Instead of racing
China to see who can destroy their creative industries the fastest, the governm ent should be protecting and encourage the artists that
nourish the spirits and m inds of this country's citizens.
