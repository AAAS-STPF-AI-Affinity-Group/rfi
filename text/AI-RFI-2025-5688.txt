General Comment
Think of the children - in a world ravaged by the insane energy cost of generative AI, where people no longer respect intellectual
property, you are stifling creativity, innovation, and critical thinking. 
Please put sensible m easures in place to ensure ethical and hum an-focused developm ent of AI. In all the hyped workshops for AI I have
attended so far, I am  only hearing people out to m ake a buck selling how m uch 'easier' and 'm ore efficient' AI can m ake one's work
without offering what the actual cost is to do it.
