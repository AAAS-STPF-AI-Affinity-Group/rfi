General Comment
Generative AI will not m ake Am erica great. All it has m anaged to create since its introduction years ago is an industry of lowest-com m on-
denom inator slop of no actual value to the Am erican people, an industry built off theft and lies. Not even Apple can use generative AI to
push sales. WE THE PEOPLE do not want generative AI pushed down our throats any m ore.
