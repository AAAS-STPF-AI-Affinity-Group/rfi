General Comment
So Essentially what you are trying to do is let these people just go ahead and use the internet to steal the work from  hard working artist,
photographers, Videographers, and so m any people who post content on the World Wide Web. I am  begging you to please, do not let
them  have fair use because all they are doing. Is taking from  im ages, and reform ing them  into a "new im age". You are opening a cesspool
for dam aging the arts or hum anity and I think it will dam age quality. Again do not loosening the stuff on AI, protect your artists, your
actors, PROTECT THE PEOPLES WORK
