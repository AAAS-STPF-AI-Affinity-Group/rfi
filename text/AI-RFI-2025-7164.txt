General Comment
I am  a freelance artist writing to voice m y opposition to the AI Action Plan, which would let OpenAI use copyrighted m aterial to train their
AI m odels. Sim ply put, this is theft and would let OpenAI and com panies like it essentially pretend that US copyright laws don't exist,
profiting off of stolen m aterial in the process. They have no m echanism s in place to financially com pensate the original creators of the
works they are training on, let alone credit those original creators. The AI Action Plan would put m y livelihood as an artist in danger, and
frankly, it has no place in this country's future.
