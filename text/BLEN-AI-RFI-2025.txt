Small Business Advantages in Federal AI Innovation 
Small businesses bring unique and valuable contributions to federal AI development that 
complement capabilities of larger firms: 1. S pe cia liz e d In n o v a tion  Ef f icie n c y: Small firms produce more patents per
employee than larger firms, and these patents are associated with higher impact,
growth, and profitability.1 In AI specifically, small businesses excel at translating
cutting-edge research into practical applications, bringing agility to
implementation.
2. Econ om ic F or ce  M u l tiplie rs: Small businesses contribute approximately 44% of
U.S. GDP and create roughly two-thirds of net new jobs.2 Integrating small AI firms
into federal initiatives amplifies economic impact while diversifying the AI supply
base beyond a handful of tech giants.
3. Nim ble  S olu tion  De v e lopm e n t: Small businesses can experiment rapidly and take
risks that larger organizations might avoid. This ability to pivot quickly allows them
to develop specialized AI applications that address specific government challenges
with greater precision and contextual understanding.

4. C om m e r cia liz a tion  A cce le r a t ors: Small firms excel at bridging the gap between
research and practical applications. They effectively transform academic concepts
into deployable solutions, a critical factor for government agencies seeking to
implement AI innovations.
However, small businesses face significant challenges when contributing to federal AI 
initiatives: 
1. P r ocu r e m e n t B a r r ie rs: Lengthy timelines and complex compliance requirements
deter many small AI companies from pursuing government contracts.3 Current
procurement processes favor established contractors with specialized government
business units.
2. R e sou r ce  Lim it a tion s: The exponential increase in computing requirements for
advanced AI development disproportionately impacts small businesses. Since
2012, computing requirements for leading AI models have doubled approximately
every 3.4 months.4
3. Da t a  A cce ss C on str a in t s: Many small AI developers struggle to access large,
high-quality datasets needed for model development, particularly in specialized
government domains.

Recommendations for the AI Action Plan 
Based on research evidence and our experience with successful collaborative models like 
the Veterans Health – MIT Hacking Medicine program, we recommend the following 
actions to enhance America's AI leadership through small business integration and 
public-private partnerships: 
1.Streamline Federal AI Procurement
R e com m e n da tion  1. 1: Expand and institutionalize small business-friendly
contracting programs across federal agencies.
Federal agencies should simplify solicitation requirements, shorten award
timelines, and carve out pilot project funding specifically for emerging AI firms.10
The DoD's Joint AI Center's Tradewind acquisition platform provides an excellent
model, enabling the award of prototype AI contracts in under two months—a
dramatic improvement over traditional timelines.11
R e com m e n da tion  1.2: Create civilian equivalents of successful DoD AI acquisition
vehicles.
The AI Action Plan should establish civilian counterparts to programs like DoD's
Tradewind and the Defense Innovation Unit DIU to streamline AI acquisition for
non-defense agencies. These mechanisms help match mission needs with
commercial technology providers while reducing participation barriers for small
companies.12
R e com m e n da tion  1. 3 : Strengthen SBIR/STTR funding for AI initiatives.
The Small Business Innovation Research SBIR  program provides a proven model
for small business inclusion. The AI Action Plan should direct agencies to increase
12 "Another initiative, the Defense Innovation Unit DIU, helps match DoD's mission needs with 
commercial technology providers, reducing the cost and effort for small companies to partner with 
the military." Source: Empowering Small Businesses in AI Development and Supply, p. 2.  11 "The Department of Defense's Joint AI Center launched Tradewind, an AI-focused acquisition 
platform that revamps the procurement process for AI solutions. Tradewind gives DoD experts 
quick access to tech innovators and enables awarding prototype AI contracts in under two 
months." Source: Empowering Small Businesses in AI Development and Supply, p. 2. 10 "Adopting agile procurement methods (like other transaction authorities or challenge-based 
acquisitions) can lower entry barriers for startups." Source: Empowering Small Businesses in AI 
Development and Supply, p. 2.

SBIR/STTR funding for AI topics and streamline the application process to enable 
more startups to contribute to federal research priorities.13 
2.Reduce Technical Barriers for Small AI Businesses
R e com m e n da tion  2. 1: Accelerate implementation of the National AI Research
Resource NAIRR .
The NAIRR will provide AI researchers—including those in startups and small
firms—access to computing resources, high-quality data, and test environments.
The AI Action Plan should fully fund and expedite NAIRR implementation, with
small businesses designated as a key user group.14
R e com m e n da tion  2.2: Create incentives for infrastructure sharing.
The government should incentivize existing infrastructure holders in industry and
academia to support startups. Tax incentives could encourage cloud providers to
donate or discount compute time to small AI companies,15 while agencies could
broker partnerships with national laboratories and universities to open
supercomputing resources during off-peak times.16
R e com m e n da tion  2. 3 : Expand federal data availability for AI development.
The Administration should prioritize full implementation of the OPEN Government
Data Act, with clear guidance to agencies on releasing useful datasets for AI R&D.
Government data—from scientific research to transportation, health, and economic
information—should be made openly accessible in machine-readable formats to
enable model development without costly proprietary data collection.
16 "Likewise, agencies can broker partnerships with national laboratories and universities to open 
up supercomputers to startups during off-peak times or through grant-supported allocations."

3.Foster Public-Private Partnerships for AI Innovation
R e com m e n da tion  3 . 1: Develop a nationwide AI hackathon program modeled after
Veterans Health – MIT Hacking Medicine.
The AI Action Plan should establish a coordinated program of agency-specific AI
hackathons following the successful Veterans Health – MIT Hacking Medicine
model.17 These programs should unite federal agencies with academia, small
businesses, and technology partners to rapidly address specific mission
challenges through AI innovation. The program should include funding for
follow-on "makeathon" phases to transform winning concepts into working
prototypes and programual production systems.R e com m e n da tion  3 .2: Establish cross-sector AI innovation collaboratives.
Create formal collaborative bodies—comprising federal agencies, small
businesses, academic institutions, and technology partners—that meet regularly to
identify AI implementation opportunities, exchange knowledge, and co-develop
solutions. These collaboratives should operate with streamlined partnership
agreements that enable small businesses to participate without prohibitive legal
barriers.
R e com m e n da tion  3 . 3 : Launch targeted AI grand challenges for small businesses.
The AI Action Plan should fund grand challenges in key areas (for example,
trustworthy AI in healthcare diagnostics or AI for disaster response) where
numerous startups can compete for significant contracts or milestone-based
funding. Such competitions spur innovation while providing winners a springboard
for broader commercialization.
R e com m e n da tion  3 .4: Establish regional AI innovation hubs focused on small
business participation.

Currently, over 90% of high-tech growth is concentrated in a few metropolitan 
areas on the coasts.18 The AI Action Plan should invest in regional AI hubs through 
a competitive selection process to seed tech ecosystems across the country, 
providing local startups with infrastructure, networking, and investor connections. 
4.Address AI Talent Development Through Small Business
Partnerships
R e com m e n da tion  4 . 1: Establish an "AICorp" program modeled after PeaceCorps.
Create a national AICorp program that recruits and trains AI specialists to serve for
23 year terms implementing AI solutions across federal agencies and
underserved communities. This program would:
-Provide stipends and educational benefits similar to PeaceCorps
-Place AI specialists in teams at federal agencies to implement specific AI
initiatives
-Partner with small businesses to provide technical mentorship and project
guidance
-Create pathways for participants to transition to permanent government or
private sector roles
-Build a network of AI practitioners with direct experience in public service
applications
This initiative would simultaneously address federal AI talent shortages while 
creating a cadre of technologists with deep understanding of government 
challenges and public service motivation. 
R e com m e n da tion  4 .2: Create specialized immigration pathways for AI talent. 
Implement the White House AI Executive Order's direction to streamline visas for 
experts in critical fields like AI.19 Prioritize AI-related talent in visa categories and 
reduce administrative backlogs to help startups recruit specialized personnel, with 
pathways to integrate international talent into the AICorp program.

R e com m e n da tion  4 . 3 : Develop AI talent exchange programs between government 
and small businesses. 
Create pathways for temporary assignments between government agencies and 
small AI businesses to cross-pollinate expertise and build relationships that 
facilitate future collaborations, modeled after the success of hackathons like the 
Veterans Health – MIT Hacking Medicine program. 
R e com m e n da tion  4 .4: Fund small business AI apprenticeship programs. 
Direct funding to small AI businesses to develop specialized training and 
apprenticeship programs that build practical AI implementation skills, with 
particular emphasis on diverse candidates and underrepresented communities. 
These apprenticeship programs could serve as feeder programs for the AICorp 
initiative. 
In Summary 
Small businesses play a critical role in America's AI innovation ecosystem, bringing agility, 
specialized expertise, and entrepreneurial energy to federal initiatives. The AI Action Plan 
represents a unique opportunity to strengthen America's AI leadership by integrating 
small businesses throughout the AI supply chain and fostering collaborative public-private 
partnerships. 
The Veterans Health – MIT Hacking Medicine program demonstrates the transformative 
potential of bringing together diverse stakeholders—federal agencies, academic 
institutions, large technology companies, and small businesses—to address complex 
challenges through AI innovation. By expanding this model across government, the AI 
Action Plan can accelerate the development and deployment of AI solutions that advance 
agency missions while creating opportunities for small business participation. 
By adopting the recommendations outlined in this comment, the AI Action Plan can 
harness the innovative potential of small businesses while addressing key challenges in AI 
procurement, infrastructure access, public-private partnerships, and talent development. 
The collaborative hackathon approach, combined with streamlined procurement 
pathways and infrastructure access, provides a practical framework for implementation. 
Incorporating these recommendations will not only enhance America's AI capabilities but 
also distribute economic benefits more widely, create tech growth in diverse 
communities, and foster a competitive AI marketplace that reflects American values of
