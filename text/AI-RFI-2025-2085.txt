General Comment
With so m any com panies already backing away from  using AI in their workplace, be it because it's inefficient or does not appeal to their
intended audiences, it would be foolish of the US to essentially double down on technology which relies on both an im perfect past without
considering the future and nuances in its creation (let alone safety), and infringing on the copyrights of even larger com panies and studios.
