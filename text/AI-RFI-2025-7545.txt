General Comment
If AI cannot continue without com m itting theft they should not be allowed to continue. AI com panies have only provided harm  and m ade
services worse. It provides no benefit to the country. AI is just the latest in a series of grifts and it needs to be m oved past. Absolutely do
not do this.
