General Comment
I am  a voice actor who used to do visual art. Seeing the tech sector ravage not one but two disciplines I have poured years of study into
over the past handful of years has been horrifying. These m odels have trained off of m y friends' and colleagues' work against their will
without their consent and without giving them  any com pensation to even m ake up for the loss of work involved. 
SAG-AFTRA has had to go on strike m ultiple tim es to protect actors from  studios taking advantage of this technology to replace them
with uninspired, soulless replicas. 
Form er president John Adam s once fam ously said, "I m ust study politics and war that m y sons m ay have liberty to study m athem atics and
philosophy. My sons ought to study m athem atics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, com m erce and
agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, m usic, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain." We were
not given the right to study the arts through the sacrifices of our forefathers for those fields of study to be rendered obsolete by m achines.
AI, if it m ust exist, ought to be doing m enial drudgery so as to free our tim e up so that m ore of us have the right to pursue creative fields,
not steal those creative fields so hum ans are stuck with nothing to look forward to but m enial drudgery. 
Generative AI has no place in any artistic field. Please stop shoving it into everything. Thank you.
