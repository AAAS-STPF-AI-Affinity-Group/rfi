General Comment
Dear Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and NITRD NCO Team ,
As I em bark on m y entrepreneurial journey with SavvyTechGirl, I aim  to be a trusted voice in technology, ensuring innovation serves
people, not just corporations. AI is at the forefront of technological advancem ent, shaping industries, policies, and the future of work.
While SavvyTechGirl’s m ission spans m ultiple areas of technology, AI’s rapid evolution m akes it critical to ensure policies encourage
ethical innovation, accessibility, and support for independent tech professionals and sm all businesses.
AI policies m ust foster responsible developm ent while ensuring opportunities in AI rem ain open and inclusive for all. Large corporations
dom inate the conversation, yet sm all businesses, independent innovators, and everyday users are equally im pacted by AI’s growth. For
AI to truly benefit society, we need policies that:
1. Support Sm all Business Innovation – AI regulations should not create barriers
that lim it access for startups and independent developers. A balanced approach 
should encourage innovation at all levels, not just in m ajor tech firm s.
2. Ensure AI Transparency & Ethical Use – AI-driven decisions should be
explainable, fair, and aligned with ethical principles that protect both 
businesses and consum ers.
3. Invest in AI Literacy & Workforce Readiness – As AI transform s industries,
education and retraining program s m ust be accessible to ensure a workforce that
can adapt and thrive alongside technological advancem ents.
The AI Action Plan is a step in the right direction, but its effectiveness will depend on how inclusive and forward-thinking these policies
becom e. I encourage the adm inistration to work toward an AI fram ework that not only advances innovation but does so in a way that is
ethical, accessible, and beneficial to all stakeholders in the tech ecosystem .
Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this conversation. I look forward to seeing how AI policies evolve and im pact the future of
technology.
Sincerely,
Sandra Griesm an
Founder, SavvyTechGirl LLC
