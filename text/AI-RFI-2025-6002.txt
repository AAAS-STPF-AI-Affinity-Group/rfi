General Comment
AI as it currently exists needs m assive troves of knowingly stolen work to function. Every book, song, or m ovie you like- where the
creators would get residuals if it were stream ed or bought - these m edia are already stolen to be used as parts of the dataset.
If a business needs to steal it's not a working business. Do not allow theft to m ake room  for hypothetical profit.
