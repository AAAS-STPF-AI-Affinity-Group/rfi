General Comment
Gen AI is a waste of m oney and we shouldn't be using tax dollars to fund it. It would not work if they hadn't stolen m illions of works from
the internet and the creators refuse to pay the people they are profiting on. It's the biggest scam  of this century. It's a m agic 8 ball that
produces results that m ay be right som e of the tim e. The fact that the governm ent t wants to im plem ent it into our system  is a huge security
risk. We need m ore AI regulations so it can stop being forced down consum ers' throats when the technology is less than useless as it is.
