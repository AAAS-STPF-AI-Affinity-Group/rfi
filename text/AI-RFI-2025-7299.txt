General Comment
AI is overhyped and has little benefit for the United States. It steals from  the livelihoods of creative artists and writers across a wide range
of m edia and disciplines. In short, it profits off of theft of people's work. Further, AI's disastrous im pact on environm ental resources vastly
outstrips any possible benefits to further developm ent of AI.
