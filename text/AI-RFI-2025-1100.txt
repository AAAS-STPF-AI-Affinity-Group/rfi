General Comment
Deepfakes are a serious problem  and are only going to get worse. If you want good publicity and a bipartisan initiative to bolster support,
why not create legislation banning them  or lim iting them  in som e way? I am  a dem ocrat but still tentatively see som e of what the Trum p
adm inistration is doing as positive. The dem ocrats are angry because the Trum p adm inistration has ripped out the guard rails around AI.
This could be a free way to lessen the hatred from  dem ocrats towards the Trum p adm inistration. When selling the legislation, use
exam ples like deepfakes used to exploit wom en, especially underage girls, and to exploit the financial m arkets by im personating influential
people. No respectable person is going to vote against this legislation except under the guise of freedom  of speech. However, there are
already hate crim e laws, so there is leeway in this area.
