General Comment
No. I do not consent to MY intellectual property being stolen and used in an AI generator of any type. What is the point of copyright,
patents, tradem arks and the like if this gets approved? It will screw over people outside of artists and writers. Got coding you want to
keep for your com pany? Sorry! It can all be stolen and used in AI. No one needs this. I am  against this. And so should every big
com pany out there, if they don't want to get screwed out of their intellectual property. 
NO to this garbage proposition.
