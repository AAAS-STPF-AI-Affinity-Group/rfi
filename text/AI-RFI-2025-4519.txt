General Comment
AI is theft of act ual work.
AI IS W RONG 60% of t he time 
It uses too much energy 
It puts peop le out of work
Unless there is a huge amount of universal bas ic income coming it will continue to destroy e verything we as Americans value 
It is a scam perpetrated by an industry out of ideas so they create a false god
Itâ€™s pure &^%
