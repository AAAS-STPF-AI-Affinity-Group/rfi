It is imperative that there are safeguards put in place to ensure that AI does not get self aware and 
also does not have access to fully control. AI should be used as a date point, but must be checked 
against and can not be the be all and end all. It is important that protocols are put in place to 
ensure AI does not have full control and that AI has checks and  balances to ensure we are not fully 
relying on it for our information.
