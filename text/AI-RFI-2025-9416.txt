To Whom  It May Concern,
I am  writing as a concerned citizen who has witnessed firsthand the growing threat posed by the unchecked developm ent and deploym ent
of AI system s by Big Tech com panies like OpenAI (Microsoft) and Google. These com panies are pushing for changes to copyright law
that would underm ine the rights of creators and sm all businesses across the country, jeopardizing livelihoods and stifling innovation.
AI system s are only able to function because they are trained on vast am ounts of creative work produced by individuals. This work—
created through years of skill developm ent, hard work, and dedication—has been taken without consent, com pensation, or credit, and fed
into these AI system s. These system s then reassem ble and reproduce the work, selling it back to the sam e m arkets that creators rely on
for their incom e. In doing so, they directly com pete with the very people whose work they exploited, cutting creators out of the
m arketplace entirely.
Now, these Big Tech com panies are lobbying for special carve-outs in copyright law to legitim ize this practice. They argue that if a
m achine ingests and reproduces copyrighted m aterial, it should be considered “fair use.” This is a dangerous precedent. It suggests that
anything and everything on the internet—regardless of who owns it—should be free for Big Tech to take and profit from . They claim  that
without these exem ptions, Am erican innovation will be stifled.
The truth is the opposite. The purpose of copyright law is to protect the incentive to create and innovate. If creators cannot own their
work, and if everything they produce online can be freely taken and m onetized by Big Tech, what incentive will there be to create? Why
would anyone invest tim e, energy, and resources into developing new ideas, designs, or innovations if they know their work will be
im m ediately exploited by corporations like Google and Microsoft?
To truly protect Am erican innovation, we m ust protect Am erican creators. This adm inistration’s AI Action Plan should not prioritize the
interests of Big Tech com panies at the expense of creators. Instead, it should focus on ensuring a fair and com petitive m arketplace that
respects the rights of individuals and sm all businesses.
Here are three key steps the AI Action Plan should take:
1. Require Effective Consent: Creators m ust have the right to decide when and how their work is used by AI system s. No work should be
ingested or reproduced without explicit perm ission from  the original creator.
2. Encourage a Licensing Marketplace: A robust licensing system  should be established to ensure that creators are fairly com pensated for
the use of their work. The econom ic value generated by creative work should benefit the creators, not just Big Tech com panies.
3. Ensure Transparency: Big Tech com panies m ust be required to disclose what m aterial is included in their training datasets and clearly


label AI-generated content. This transparency is essential for accountability and fairness.
I want to be clear: I am  not anti-technology or anti-AI. These system s have incredible potential and can be powerful tools for innovation.
However, we cannot allow their developm ent to com e at the expense of hardworking Am ericans. Rewriting copyright law to benefit Big
Tech at the expense of creators is not the path forward.
Thank you for the opportunity to com m ent on these critical issues. I urge you to prioritize the rights and livelihoods of creators and sm all
businesses as you shape the future of AI policy.
Sincerely,
Alex Starbuck
