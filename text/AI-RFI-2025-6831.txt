General Comment
Generative AI does not hold a place in the United State's future. It is an overhyped, dangerous blight built on theft that threatens not only
the livelihoods of m any Am ericans but leaves a devastatingly large environm ental footprint. It is being pushed so forcefully because
corporations are flailing to get a return on the fortunes they've sunk into an inherently predatory and problem atic system . 
It has even m ore ruinous potential if granted wholesale use of copyrighted works, particularly anything that m ight allow genAI platform s to
create and perpetuate falsified photos, videos, etc. Beyond that, its capacity for the spread of m isinform ation is m assive and studies are
showing that it can "inhibit critical engagem ent with work and can potentially lead to long-term  overreliance on the tool and dim inished skill
for independent problem -solving" (please see attached file).
