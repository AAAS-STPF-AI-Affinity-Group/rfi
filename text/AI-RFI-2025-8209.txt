General Comment
This is highly dangerous for the intellectual property rights for Am erica's writers, artists, and sm all business owners. Training AI is not a
com pelling enough reason to violate copyright law. Businesses large and sm all will be afraid to publish any work in the US for fear of
having it stolen. 
The com m ent period on this has been too short as well. The public deserves a right to weigh in.
