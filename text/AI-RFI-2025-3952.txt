General Comment
Generative AI steals jobs and harm s our society. The com panies developing it do not care about citizens or even the well-being of this
country, only filling their own pockets. AI is used for m isinform ation & lies as well, m any slanderous things are m ade about politicians,
celebrities & regular people. AI is largely used for evil sexual harassm ent acts, including towards children. AI is often used for scam m ing
people as well, especially elderly that cannot tell the difference. One can go on any social m edia and see the absolute m ountain of garbage
and scam s it has. Do not fund AI, it is used as a tool of propaganda, theft and m isinform ation. The only thing we should be using it for is
how to destroy other countries looking to flood us with it. We shouldn't be trying to beat China in the race towards better AI, we should
be trying to poison the pool and m ake it so other countries don't want to use it.
