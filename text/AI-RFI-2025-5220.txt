General Comment
Generative AI is horrific, creepy, destroying internet search results, spreading false inform ation, and only satisfies those that want instant
gratification. Why in search would you want som ething like that to be able to steal and copy whatever it wants and produce it in a
cheaper, crappier way. It’s a fad, just like NFTs before them . Generative AI has not done one good thing since it’s inception, and China
has a better version of it anyway, you’re not being innovative here.
