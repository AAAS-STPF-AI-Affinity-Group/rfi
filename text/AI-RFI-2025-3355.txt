Ai is not cool it is basically stripping the joy and creativity from  actual artists and people can just type in a few characters and boom  a
im age pops up and people say they created it and I don't know for sure but it probably is taking others art and putting it though som ething
else and when new people try to m ake som ething they saw on there and follow the steps for it, it doesn't even turn out CLOSE to what
they saw and they would probably feel discouraged or feel angry or upset at them  selfs and it's because they can't recreate som ething that
a ai m ade and they did not know it it's ruining artist because they don't feel acknowledged for the tim e and effort they put into som ething
and they people who just used ai is getting m ost and probably all the credit and if they keep doing that it will probably ruin the life's of
people who m ake and sell art for a living will get there life's ruined and newbies who want to try it out will get discouraged so please try
yalls best to rem ove it, it's hurting m ore people. Thank you for reading and understanding this
