It is imperative to be on the forefront of AI. Further safeguards for American citizens needs to extend 
in relation to AI regulations. There are foreign adversaries that will use AI negatively. I therefore 
suggest social security cards issued as nfts to an  individual upon their birth (and retroactively), 
allowing a clear view of the use of their social security number. These regulations need to go even 
further that the government needs to secure that everyone has access to their nfts, a wallet if you 
will. And this will further assist in the security of digital currency attributed to one person for all tax 
purposes.
