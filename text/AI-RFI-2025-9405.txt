I am  an independent freelance illustrator and have been for five years. I've been working towards bigger goals, but AI program s are a
m ajor hindrance. Not only do they affect m e, but they affect artists with a larger online platform , and artists working in the professional
anim ation, video gam e and illustration industry.
Google, Microsoft, Meta, and so m any other big tech com panies with AI system s and investing in AI are directly harm ing artists big and
sm all as all of them  rely on copyrighted data for training. To take the artworks of an artist-who spent their whole lives developing their
craft, likely went to school to hone their craft, and took that years of learning and skill and put it into the tim e it took into said artwork-and
use it to train data so that artist can be replaced is abhorrent. It is cruel to put that artist out of work. It is cruel to replace artists. It is cruel
to replace hum an creativity for the sake of saving m oney.
Copyright is m eant to protect the creations of artists. If artists do not own their works, what is the point of any copyright? Who owns
anything? This is not just deregulation, it is theft. It is letting big tech com panies get away with theft from  individual artists and their legally
owned, copyrighted artworks.
This ruling could ruin the m eaning of copyright in it's entirety. Do Not Let Tech Com panies Take The Copyrighted Works Of Individual
Artists To Train AI.
Do Not Let AI Steal Art.
