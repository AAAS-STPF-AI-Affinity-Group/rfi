General Comment
This is does NOTHING to benefit the Am erican people. This is Sam  Altm an begging the current adm inistration to give him  im m unity to
existing copyright laws and a heaping spoonful of federal funding because he knows his com pany is not even the slightest bit sustainable.
OpenAI hem orrhages m oney as its shareholders only understand "Buy m ore servers. Need m ore power," instead of m aking it m ore
efficient. This results in a horrendous im pact on local power grids, such as fluctuations and blackouts.
