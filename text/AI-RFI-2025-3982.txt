General Comment
As an artist and creator, I vehem ently oppose the use of AI system s. It is blatant theft and will destroy the creative industry and jobs that
exist within it. AI """art""" is nothing but exploitation and the draining of hum anity out of the m ost hum an action there is - creating art.
