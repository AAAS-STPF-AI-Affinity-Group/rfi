The AI action plan will not benefit the united states, if it is allowed that open ai have access to
copyrighted items without fear of lawsuits, it will not benefit the common man, it will notbenefit the middle man, it will not benefit anybody besides the few corporate executives thatwill proceed to profit majorly off of the added contents, it will not improve the ai in a way thatis tangible or feasible, and it isn't a bridge into the future. All it is is allowing one company tosteal and commit fraud on thousands of works without concern, and if the government has anyinterest in not being a slave to corporate greed, it will work against this plan.
