General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US because all it has done so far is serve as a plague. The upkeep alone used to
m aintain it is actively destroying our world, not only that, but it just steals and steals from  hard working people, m yself included. And if you
think you are im m une to the dangers this ai presents, you will find yourself m istaken. It m ust be held accountable for EVERYONE'S sake
