General Comment
Any plan for AI usage by the Federal Governm ent m ust include a detailed outline of how the governm ent plans to incorporate FAIR and
CARE principles. These standards and best practices m ust be incorporated sym m etrically. By sym m etrically I m ean that it is not sufficient
to require data and language producers to incorporate open science and open data practices into the work that feeds AI program s; the
outputs of LLMs, m achine learning, and other artificial intelligence m ust also give credit and openly cite their sources. This gives users the
ability to trace the sources of AI outputs and it gives credit to data producers.
Also, no AI program s should m ake decisions about people, including em ploym ent, healthcare, benefits, or law enforcem ent. These actions
require hum an input and em pathy to ensure that no Am ericans are harm ed by non-hum an decision m akers.
