General Comment
This is a very bad idea for the Am erican public. As it is, AI has already done significant dam age to the publicâ€™s ability to access accurate
and verifiable inform ation and this request will only worsen this. Many Am ericans have requested inform ation from  openAI that is
probably false. Additionally, AI is taking jobs from  every industry and this will quicken that process, stealing inform ation from  the
Am erican public so that it can replace them  with cheaper labor that will provide exceedingly lower quality work. This action will im pact
every Am erican, replacing their jobs and spreading m isinform ation quickly and efficiently.
