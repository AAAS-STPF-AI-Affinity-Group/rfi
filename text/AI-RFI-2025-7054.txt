General Comment
Copyright laws exist for a reason, and we should do all that we can to protect the hard work of artists, m usicians, and creators. If the AI
private sector cannot innovate without stealing the work of others to feed into their abhorrent m achines, then it should die. Pick up a pencil
or instrum ent and create som ething for once in your sad life.
