General Comment
These m ajor com panies with so m uch m oney are dem anding the governm ent to step in and m ake it legal to steal the work of artists of all
varieties and backgrounds, sim ply because of a hypothetical foreign threat? 
How is it that our work isn't considered valuable, but is som ehow worthy of having a governm ental body force it to be given away? This
isn’t som e great voluntary action for the betterm ent of m ankind; This is sim ply theft for their profit off our hard work without so m uch as a
please or a thank you. 
We don’t m ake content for free use. If we WANTED to do that we sim ply would and there would be dialogue being had. Instead, this is
just forcibly ripping off our own m aterial from  our hard work, and giving it to a giant corporation to m ake uninspired nonsense with; and
being told that we have no right as artists to be upset about it. 
Honestly it's beyond insulting, and a spit in the face to artists to have their lively hood be taken advantage of by corporations who are too
lazy to put in the work them selves; and require stealing from  others in order to m ake m oney.
