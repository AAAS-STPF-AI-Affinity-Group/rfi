General Comment
Do not allow AI to freely be used by com panies, agencies, providers, governm ent, etc. without regulation. There needs to be regulation
and protection against the use of AI. AI is NOT the future of the state, country, or the world. AI can be used for assisting in achieving a
greater product, not for creating products. AI can be used as a substitute; not as a replacem ent for work. There are also artists of m any
m edium s that will be affected if this takes place, it m eans no one can get work done and this will NOT cut costs of the the econom y, it will
kill the econom y due to fact no one will be paid, and thus businesses will not flourish and no em ployee will be paid, resulting in a hard
crash. This statem ent applies to m usicians as they are a part of being an artist. Please take into consideration of this regulation and do not
proceed forward with this action. Please review and take tim e to research the im pact of AI use and the products out of it. The com m unity
will be relieved and will be happy if this does not proceed forth. I have said m y peace. Have a wonderful day.
