General Comment
I am  a professional writer. I work hard, every dam n day, to create what I do. I do not want m y hopes, m y dream s, m y words, gobbled
up by som e soulless com puter only to be spit back out again devoid of any body or soul. 
I dont believe greedy assholes should be able to use m y work for free to train their m achines- m achines they are training to replace m e
and what I do. 
AI is m eant to m ake our lives better. To do the m undane work so that we can be better hum ans - freeing us to wonder about the universe.
To m arvel in its beauty. To create m asterpieces that m ove people to tears. To create silly little stories that m ake people laugh. 
AI is not m eant to output art. Not m eant to destroy the world we live in. Destroy lives by replacing hum ans in order to save a buck. 
AI does not belong in creative places. And it certainly should not be trained on copyrighted works.
