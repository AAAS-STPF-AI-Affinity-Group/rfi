General Comment
AI is theft. It does not provide a service for the Am erican public good--it plagairizes from  others' livelihoods and splices those words
together to m ake likes. It has done nothing but waste water and m ake internet search engines unusable. No copyright infringem ent for the
purpose of churning out lies with fake citations.
