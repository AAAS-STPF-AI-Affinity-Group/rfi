General Comment
AI has no true value. It's a scam  designed to fleece good people who didn't grow up with technology and don't realize that all AI is is a
sham  that generates lies from  stolen content. It's unpopular, unprofitable, and unusable. Support the hum ans who live in this great country,
not som e hallucinatory m achine.
