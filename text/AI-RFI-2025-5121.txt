General Comment
Iâ€™m  a writer and do not want m y published work being m ined as that destroys m y business and ability to support m yself and m y fam ily. I
also think AI devours too m uch energy that can be better devoted to worthier projects. Preserving copyright is critical to individuals and
businesses engaged in creative innovation. Underm ining these protections would destroy critical sectors of society.
