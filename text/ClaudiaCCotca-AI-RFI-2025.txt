oStrategies for Accelerating Drug Discovery through AI .
•Facilitate the growth of  digitization, bioconvergent, and  AI startup s, particularly in small
business entity format through government subsidized or unsecured infusion capital with
easy access,  by streamlining grant processes and improving access to computing
resources, thereby reducing bureaucratic challenges.
4.Regulatory Framework and Governance
Given the ethical problems with AI, it seems clear that regulation should promote innovation 
while ensuring responsible deployment. Recommended actions include:  
•We encourage the development of a proactive prevention strategy aimed at reducing
potential risks associated with digitization, bioconvergent and AI systems. This includes
addressing its possible disruptive effects on human dignity, social stability, legal
frameworks, ethical standards, personal privacy, and overall public safety.
•It is essential to establish well -defined, risk -based regulatory guidelines for artificial
intelligence that thoughtfully differentiate between low -risk consumer applications, such
as chatbots, virtual assistants, and social robots, and high -risk applicati ons, including
self-driving vehicles, military AI systems, and AI -assisted surgeries. A human controlled
at all times approach will ensure safety and promote innovation in the development of AI
technologies.
•It is essential to consider providing guarded, boundary set by faith based ethics and
Hippocratic Oath legal protections and regulatory exemptions for digitization,
bioconvergent, and AI developers engaged in critical national interest sectors, including
healthcare and biotechnology. For instance, facilitating expedited pathways for FDA
