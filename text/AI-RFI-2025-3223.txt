General Comment
As an Am erican Citizen, I do not see how 'AI', as is used m ost by such corporations as OpenAI and Google, has any m eaningful place in
our world or laws. Especially not when it relies on stealing the independant works of so m any not just within the U.S, but around the
world, and consequently their livelihoods. Even outside the realm s of data harvesting, applications such as writing, voicework, m usic, all
perform  the sam e or sim ilar harm s with 'AI'. All of this without even m entioning the serious dangers it poses for environm ental health.
