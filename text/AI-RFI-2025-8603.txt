General Comment
AI m ust be regulated to ensure basic protections for Intellectual Property and individual identity are protected. AI is being developed to
steal IP, art, m usic of all kinds, plagiarize copyrighted writings and literature works without com pensation. This is plainly "stealing".
OpenAI and other corporations m ust not be allowed to steal from  other citizens and corporations who own their own work product.
