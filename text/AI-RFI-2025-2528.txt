General Comment
Creatives deserve to have their work, created with their skills which were acquired based on their tim e investm ent and physical labor,
protected. Com panies have no right to profit off of any artists work, and they have no right to train their AI on it, without positive, opt in
consent and appropriate com pensation. Copyright law m ay be flawed but it is the only protection creatives currently have for their work
and m ust be respected. If com panies want to train “AI”, they need to buy the license to this work. Posting som ething online does not
autom atically m ake it part of creative com m ons.
