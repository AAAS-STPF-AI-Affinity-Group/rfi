Re: Request for Information (RFI) on the Development of an Arti ﬁcial Intelligence 
(AI) Action Plan (“Plan”) 
Introduction 
Today, America stands at a critical in ﬂection point in the global arti ﬁcial intelligence 
race. As directed by Ex ecutive Order 14179 (Removing Barriers to American 
Leadership in Arti ﬁcial Intelligence), establishing an e ﬀective AI Action Plan requires 
leveraging the complementar y strengths of both public and private sectors while 
acknowledging current market dynamics. The private sector has established a 
signiﬁcant lead in AI development capabilities that government e ﬀorts should 
strategically harness, rather than duplicate. 
WindBorne Systems proposes a framework that positions the Federal Government as 
the world's most sophisticated AI customer while driving American technological 
leadership through four core principles: 
 1 


 WINDBORNE - RFI on the Development of an AI Plan  UPDATED MARCH 2025 
1.Strategic Resource Allocation:  The Federal Government should redirect
resources from internal AI model development toward streamlined procurement
pathways for private sector AI solutions, closing capability gaps through
strategic acquisition rather than parallel development.
2.Performance-Based Evaluation:  All Government AI procurement must require
rigorous live product demonstrations with standardized evaluation protocols,
ensuring taxpayer resources support genuinely eﬀective technologies that exist
today, rather than lengthy, duplicative development e ﬀorts.
3.Transformational E ﬃciency Metrics:  Government implementation of AI should
be evaluated based on measurable e ﬃciency multipliers, recognizing  that
properly deployed AI can deliver order-of-magnitude improvements beyond
incremental gains.
4.Establishing Required Infrastructure: AI solution implementations will have
massive compute requirements beyond the already extensive technical
infrastructure supporting existing programs. Used eﬀectively, AI advancements
that enable e ﬃciencies in execution can also enable e ﬃciencies in operation.
By adopting these principles, the AI Action Plan can establish a procurement 
ecosystem that accelerates America's AI advantage, provides superior capabilities to 
government agencies, and ensures U.S. leadership in the broader technological 
revolution.

 WINDBORNE - RFI on the Development of an AI Plan                                            UPDATED MARCH 2025 
 
Current AI Landscape and America’s Competitive 
Position 
The global AI landscape has fundamentally transformed over the past ﬁve years, 
creating new competitive dynamics between nations  and rede ﬁning public-private 
sector relationships. America's private sector leads in foundational model 
development, with companies investing tens of billions in research infrastructure and 
talent acquisition. This investment substantially exceeds public sector capabilities, with 
leading AI ﬁrms deploying computational resour ces that surpass those available to 
most Government agencies by orders of magnitude. 
The economics of AI development have reached a critical threshold: expertise, data, 
and computational capacity have consolidated within the private sector to a degree 
that makes Government-led frontier model development increasingly challenging from 
both resource and talent perspectives. Unlike previous technological revolutions where 
Government-led research preceded commercial applications, the innovation ﬂow in AI 
has signi ﬁcantly evolved within the commercial sect or over the past decade while 
Government agencies have had slower rates of development and adoption, or in some 
cases none at all. 
Global Competition: America’s Strategic Opportunity 
While American commercial companies lead the world in core AI innovation, 
governments in both China and the European Union have implemented approaches 
that challenge our nation’s long-term advantage.  
China has integrated AI development into its national strategy, fostering tight 
coordination between state entities and technology companies through favorable 
regulatory environments and data access policies. Rather than developing 
government-exclusive models, China has created symbiotic relationships where 
government needs drive private sector development, accelerating deployment across 
strategic sectors. The European Union, despite regulatory caution evidenced in the AI 
Act, has pivoted toward selective procurement and adaptation of private sector models 
for public use. European governments increasingly focus on creating interoperability 
standards and regulatory frameworks that allow government entities to leverage private 
innovation while maintaining European values and governance. These contrasting 
  3 


 WINDBORNE - RFI on the Development of an AI Plan  UPDATED MARCH 2025 
international approaches demonstrate that e ﬀective national AI strategies  recognize the 
complementary roles of public and private sectors rather than attempting to duplicate 
capabilities across both domains. 
The United States faces a profound strategic choice: continue pursuing increasingly 
resource-intensive Government-led AI development or implement procurement 
strategies that harness private sector innovation while ensuring Government 
requirements are met. Evidence strongly suggests the latter approach oﬀers the most 
viable path to maintaining American leadership. The U .S. is alr eady behind and the 
luxury of time to develop bespoke solutions does not exist. Fortunately, the need for 
bespoke solutions can be comprehensively met with commercial solutions that are 
operational today. 
This does not diminish Government's critical role but represents an opportunity to 
refocus resources where public sector involvement remains essential: 
●Establishing comprehensive evaluation frameworks
●Ensuring robust security standards
●Facilitating responsible innovation
●Directing private sector development toward national priorities through strategic
procurement
The most successful international models demonstrate that governments achieve 
maximum impact by establishing clear requirements, creating favorable development 
environments, and implementing performance-based procurement processes that drive 
private innovation toward public needs. By shifting from development to strategic 
acquisition, the Government can leverage America's private sector advantage as a 
national asset to power continued American dominance worldwide. 
Framework for Government AI Procurement 
The Federal Government's approach to AI acquisition requires fundamental 
restructuring to capitalize on America's private sector innovation advantage. Current 
procurement processes—designed for traditional software and hardware 
acquisition—are misaligned with the rapid development cycles and unique evaluation 
requirements of advanced AI systems. We propose a comprehensive framework that 
prioritizes capability validation, deployment speed, and strategic value creation. 
 4 


 WINDBORNE - RFI on the Development of an AI Plan  UPDATED MARCH 2025 
From Parallel Development to Strategic Acquisition 
Federal agencies should position themselves as sophisticated customers of America's 
world-leading AI ecosystem rather than attempting to replicate capabilities internally. 
This approach recognizes that the most advanced AI capabilities will emerge from 
private sector innovation, with Government agencies focusing on eﬀectively directing 
and harnessing these capabilities  toward public objectives. 
Our recommended procurement framework is organized around three principles: 
1.Capabilities Validation Through Demonstration
The gap between claimed and actual AI capabilities necessitates a 
demonstration-centered evaluation approach. Unlike traditional software where 
speciﬁcations can be veri ﬁed through documentation review , AI systems require 
practical performance testing in realistic environments. Federal procurement should 
require: 
●Live capability demonstrations in environments that accurately represent actual
Government use cases, with standardized evaluation protocols speci ﬁc to each
application domain
●Extended evaluation periods (4-8 weeks) for mission-critical systems to assess
performance stability and adaptation to real-world data variations
●Benchmark comparison against current Government processes to quantify
eﬃciency improvements
●Blind adversarial testing to verify system performance against unanticipated
inputs or deliberate manipulation attempts
By centering evaluation on demonstrated rather than documented capabilities, 
agencies can make procurement decisions based on actual performance rather than 
theoretical speciﬁcations. 
2.Accelerated Acquisition Pathways
Current Federal acquisition processes operate too slowly for the AI development cycle. 
By the time traditional procurement procedures complete, innovative underlying 
technologies will have undergone multiple iterations, meaning the version actually 
procured is stale on day one. 
 5 


 WINDBORNE - RFI on the Development of an AI Plan  UPDATED MARCH 2025 
To address this misalignment, we recommend: 
●Expanding Other Transaction Authority (OTA) usage across civilian agencies for
AI procurement, following success within the Department of Defense
●Creating AI-speci ﬁc Federal Supply Schedule categories  with pre-negotiated
terms and simpli ﬁed ordering procedures
●Establishing Government-wide AI Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) that
pre-qualify vendors while allowing ﬂexible deployment options
●Implementing phased procurement approaches that begin with rapid pilot
deployments before scaling to enterprise implementation
●Raising simpli ﬁed acquisition thresholds speci ﬁcally for AI technologies to
enable fast er purchasing decisions
These mechanisms would allow agencies to move from initial AI solution identi ﬁcation 
to operational deployment in months r ather than years, aligning government 
procurement timelines with the pace of AI advancement. 
3.Values-Based Contracting Models
Traditional Government IT contracts focus primarily on cost and compliance with 
predetermined speciﬁcations. This approach fundamentally  misaligns incentives for AI 
procurement, where value derives from performance improvements rather than feature 
checklists. The result is that often the most eﬀective technical solutions ar e disquali ﬁed 
from procurement because of overly pr escriptive requirements laid forth by those who 
are experts in the technological gaps needing to be ﬁlled rather than the possible 
solutions that can ﬁll them.  To facilitate the Federal Government’ s procurement of the 
most e ﬀective, e ﬃcient, and advanced solutions, we suggest: 
●Outcomes-based contracting that ties compensation to measurable
improvements in Government operations (e.g., processing time reduction,
accuracy improvements, resource savings)
●Shared savings models where vendors receive a percentage of veri ﬁed cost
reductions achieved through  AI implementation
●Scale-based pricing that reduces per-transaction costs as system utilization
increases, incentivizing both Government adoption and vendor performance
●Performance incentive payments linked to exceeding baseline e ﬃciency
requirements

It is critical to realign incentives, encouraging vendors to maximize Government 
operational improvements rather than merely delivering compliant systems. 
Institutional Infrastructure for E ﬀective Implementation 
Successfully implementing this framework requires new institutional capabilities and 
structures within the Federal Government: 
● Establishing AI Solutions O ﬃces within Federal agencies t o provide technical 
expertise and contract vehicles relevant to implementing the Federal AI Action 
Plan 
● Creating agency-speci ﬁc AI procurement t eams with solutions o ﬃces that 
combine technical specialists, pr ocurement o ﬃcers, and program managers  
● Developing standardized procurement language and templates for AI 
capabilities that focus on performance metrics rather than technical 
speci ﬁcations 
● Implementing mandatory cross-agency knowledge sharing of AI implementation 
successes and lessons learned 
Technical Infrastructure for Operational E ﬃciency 
AI implementations will require compute infrastructures across the Federal Government 
that far exceed the computational capabilities currently available. However, AI 
innovations extend far beyond user-facing insights and eﬃciencies, and in many cases 
AI-based solutions can close  the computational  gaps that may be created by model 
implementation. To ensure AI solutions are implemented on a near turn-key basis within 
the Government, Federal agencies must seek not only front-facing AI solutions, but 
also backend processing innovations.  
Addressing Implementation Barriers 
Several barriers currently impede e ﬀective Government AI adoption and must be 
addressed syst ematically. Legacy system integration requirements signi ﬁcantly 
complicate deployment of advanced AI capabilities, often for cing innovative solutions 
to be watered down to accommodate outdated infrastructure. This is compounded by 
a risk-averse acquisition culture that prioritizes compliance over capability, creating 
evaluation frameworks that favor documented speciﬁcations rather than demonstrat ed 
  7 


 WINDBORNE - RFI on the Development of an AI Plan  UPDATED MARCH 2025 
performance. Furthermore, limited technical expertise among procurement 
professionals evaluating AI solutions leads to di ﬃculty distinguishing between genuine 
innovation and mark eting  hyperbole. By speci ﬁcally targeting these barriers through  
policy reform, training programs, and institutional adjustments, the federal government 
can dramatically accelerate its ability to harness private sector AI innovations while 
ensuring taxpayer resources support technologies that deliver measurable operational 
improvements. 
Transformational E ﬃciency Through AI 
Implementation 
The transformative potential of AI in Government operations extends far beyond 
incremental improvements. When properly evaluated and deployed, AI systems can 
deliver order-of-magnitude eﬃciency gains across federal functions.  
Current Government operations frequently involve substantial manual processing, 
resource-intensive computational tasks, and complex decision-making processes with 
limited technological support. The strategic implementation of AI can fundamentally 
transform these workﬂows by: 
●Accelerating processing speeds while maintaining or improving accuracy,
allowing agencies to clear backlogs and respond more rapidly to emerging
situations●Dramatically reducing infrastructure requirements through more e ﬃcient
computational approaches
●Enabling previously impossible capabilities by automating complex cognitive
tasks that were previously beyond the scope of technological assistance
Measuring Transformation: E ﬃciency Multipliers 
To realize similar e ﬃciency multipliers across government oper ations, federal agencies 
should implement a consistent framework for evaluating AI solutions based on 
quantiﬁable e ﬃciency metrics: 
1.Baseline Current Performance: Prior to AI implementation, agencies should
document existing process throughput, accuracy, resource requirements, and
operational limitations to establish clear performance baselines.

2. Deﬁne Comprehensive Metrics: Agencies  should develop metrics that capture 
both performance improvements (e.g., speed, accuracy, capability) and resource 
reductions (e.g., infrastructure, energy, personnel time) to calculate true 
eﬃciency multipliers. 
3. Require Quanti ﬁable Demonstrations: V endor demonstrations should provide 
concrete evidence of e ﬃciency gains through  live system operation with 
representative agency data and work ﬂows. 
4. Calculate Total E ﬃciency Impact: Evaluation should consider  the combined 
eﬀect of performance improvements  and resource reductions to determine the 
total e ﬃciency multiplier o ﬀered by proposed AI solutions. 
5. Implement Veri ﬁcation Procedures:  Post-deployment veri ﬁcation should 
conﬁrm that promised e ﬃciency gains ar e realized in actual operations, with 
contractual remedies if targets are not achieved. 
Case Study: WindBorne’s AI Weather Intelligence Systems 
WindBorne Systems demonstrates how private sector AI solutions can deliver 
transformational eﬃciency improvements  to Government operations using our 
advanced weather intelligence platforms. These systems exemplify the principles 
advocated throughout this response and stand ready for rigorous demonstration and 
evaluation. 
WeatherMesh: AI-Based Numerical Weather Prediction 
WindBorne's WeatherMesh fundamentally transforms weather forecasting through 
advanced AI techniques. This system consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based 
global models on multiple benchmarks—including those from Google, Huawei, 
ECMWF, and NOAA's GFS—while requiring a fraction of the computational resources. 
The computational e ﬃciency gains achieved by W eatherMesh exemplify the 
order-of-magnitude improvements possible through AI implementation. Traditional 
physics-based forecasting systems require massive supercomputing infrastructure 
costing hundreds of millions, or billions, in infrastructure and millions in annual energy 
consumption. In stark contrast, WeatherMesh executes a complete 10-day global 
forecast in under 60 seconds on a single GPU—representing a computational 
eﬃciency improvement e xceeding 140,000x compared to traditional approaches. This 
dramatic reduction in computational requirements doesn't come at the cost of

accuracy; instead, WeatherMesh delivers comparable or superior forecast quality while 
fundamentally transforming the economics and accessibility of advanced weather 
prediction capabilities. 
Figure 01: WindBorne’s arti ﬁcial intelligence numerical weather pr ediction (AIWP) 
model outperforms GFS and IFS in RMSE across all the above variables, where 
the WeatherMesh margin for error is represented in green. 
WeatherMesh provides ensemble model forecasts on a 0.25-degree global grid for 14+ 
days, predicting surface and atmospheric variables including temperature, wind, 
precipitation, and cloud cover at arbitrary resolutions.  
WindBorne Catalyst: Infrastructure Optimization 
WindBorne's Catalyst system demonstrates how AI can simultaneously improve 
performance while reducing resource requirements. This integrated hardware and 
software solution provides continuous forecasting with new global predictions every 10 
minutes, rather than the traditional 6-hour cycle, achieving a 36x improvement in 
update frequency. It features a reduced infrastructure footprint to approximately half of

a standard 42U server rack, replacing the room-sized traditional installations that 
typically house conventional forecasting systems.  
 
Figure 02: Catalyst can be implemented with WeatherMesh in tandem or as a standable 
hardware solution to augment traditional NWP systems. 
Additionally, Catalyst achieves dramatically lower energy consumption compared to 
traditional forecasting systems, supporting Federal sustainability goals while delivering 
superior performance. Procuring WindBorne Catalyst carries approximately 1/100th of 
the cost of super computers used to support existing Federal weather forecasting 
operations. This implementation demonstrates how properly selected AI solutions can 
transform Government operations while simultaneously reducing costs and 
environmental impact.  
Alignment with National Security and Economic 
Leadership This procurement-centered approach directly enhances America's national security 
posture by accelerating deployment of advanced capabilities to defense and 
intelligence agencies, closing capability gaps with potential adversaries. It enables 
more rapid identiﬁcation of adversarial AI capabilities  through continuous performance 
evaluation in realistic scenarios. The approach strengthens industrial base resilience 
  11 


 WINDBORNE - RFI on the Development of an AI Plan  UPDATED MARCH 2025 
through diversi ﬁed AI suppliers and consistent assessment standards, while ensuring 
security requir ements are integrated into AI procurement from the earliest stages, and 
not added as afterthoughts. 
Simultaneously, it drives economic competitiveness by creating clear market incentives 
for private sector AI development aligned with national priorities. The framework 
establishes objective performance standards that reward genuine innovation rather 
than marketing claims, supporting American AI companies competing in global 
markets through references and proven performance metrics. By accelerating 
beneﬁcial AI applications across government ser vices, this approach improves citizen 
experiences while demonstrating American technological leadership in practical 
applications that can be emulated worldwide.  
Conclusion 
The arti ﬁcial intelligence revolution  represents both the greatest economic opportunity 
and the most signi ﬁcant competitive challenge America has faced in a generation. The 
Federal Government's response will fundamentally shape whether the United States 
maintains its position as the world's leading technological innovator or cedes this 
advantage to strategic competitors. 
The Federal Government's AI strategy must recognize market realities while leveraging 
America's unique advantages. By positioning Government agencies as sophisticated 
customers rather than parallel developers, and by implementing rigorous 
demonstration-based procurement processes, we can ensure taxpayer resources 
support genuinely eﬀective technologies that deliver measurable impr ovements to 
government operations. 
Through implementation of these principles across procurement, infrastructure, 
workforce, and international domains, the Administration has an unprecedented 
opportunity to accelerate American AI leadership. A forward-looking approach that 
harnesses private sector innovation, while addressing legitimate security concerns, will 
position the United States to lead not just in AI development but in the broader 
technological revolution it enables. 
The window for securing America's AI leadership is narrow but still open. With decisive 
action guided by market realities rather than bureaucratic imperatives, this 
Administration can ensure that artiﬁcial intelligence advances American  prosperity,
