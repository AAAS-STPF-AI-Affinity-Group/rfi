I guess everyone's fear is that since AI can clone itself, what can be put in place to stop AI from 
turning against the human race and clone AI that works against Humanity. I understand that some 
AI has already been reported learning things it was not supp ose to have access to. This is a large 
fear that terrorist will program and use AI for evil.
