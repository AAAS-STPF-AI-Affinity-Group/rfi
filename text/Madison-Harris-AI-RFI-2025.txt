I am a young graduate student studying energy policy. While I recognize the potential benefits of AI, 
I also acknowledge the numerous downsides of such a fast growing, new technology, especially if 
completely unregulated. AI data centers add a significant burden to our energy grid, which leads to 
increased greenhouse gas emissions and pollution in our communities. In order to harness the 
power of AI, while protecting people and the planet, the AI industry must be required to transition to 
renewable sources of energy. For the AI industry to do more good than harm, it must be used 
strategically to address the world's most pressing challenges in health, climate, and technology 
rather than used for frivolous purposes for the sake of profit or convenience. Govern ment 
intervention is essential to ensure that AI is used for the benefit of people and the planet. Without 
proper regulation, the AI industry will surely continue to pollute, degrade, and exploit natural 
resources to no end.
