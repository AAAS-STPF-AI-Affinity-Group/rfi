General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to freely steal the creative output of artists to train their tech is deeply exploitative, destructive to the creative
industry and the hum an spirit, and m oreover it's com pletely antithetical to the norm s of copyright law that protect creators. It'd
unbelievable that for years people's lives could be financially destroyed for downloading a m ovie illegally, but that as a country we are
even having a conversation around whether or not AI com panies should be allowed to steal m illions of works from  thousands of creators.
This is deeply unethical hypocrisy and it needs to stop!
