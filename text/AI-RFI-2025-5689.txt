General Comment
Generative AI is reliant on intellectual and creative theft, and it harm s real artists and creative talents, as well as polluting the culture that
consum es it. Generative AI and sim ilar LLM tools should not be supported or used by the United States governm ent generally, and only
possibly supported in lim ited scientifically rigorously evaluated research applications. 
In addition to harm ing the livelihoods of artists, stealing and corrupting the work of precious creators, and degrading the body of creative
output, the infrastructure and resources required to power generative AI processing are harm ful to their com m unities and environm ents. 
OpenAI and sim ilar m odels should not be allowed to corrupt Am ericaâ€™s future.
