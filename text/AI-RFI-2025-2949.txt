General Comment
I fail to see how this will im prove the developm ent of GenAI. I only see an excuse to infringe on copyright and national security. These
com panies are playing with fire here, and it will be m ostly the Am erican people who will suffer the consequences, not the foreign agencies
com peting with us. Everyone but the GenAi developers will be the losers here.
