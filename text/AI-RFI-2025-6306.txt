General Comment
I believe that generative AI m odels should not be allowed to use copyright m aterial for training purposes. I believe it is not fair use as these
m odels using copyrighted m aterial are not using them  in any transform ative m atter, rather they're used so the m odels can produce a
product without any sort of critical or educational purpose. Considering this use of copyrighted m aterial fair use only hurts the rights of
Am erican artists.
