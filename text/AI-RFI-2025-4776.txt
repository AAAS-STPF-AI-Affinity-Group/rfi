General Comment
AI is not the future. All that opening up AI to feed and train on copyright im ages, written work, and film  is going to kill jobs in the industry.
You need the hum an touch to create som ething with soul. AI is soulless and it's honestly noticeable. The adm inistration has already stolen
jobs from  hard working Am ericans, and this would steel m ore. Do not allow this to pass.
