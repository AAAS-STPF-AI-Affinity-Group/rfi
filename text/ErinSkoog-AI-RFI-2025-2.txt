Good evening.
I’m writing in to submit my comment on the government’s AI Action Plan to encourage them to abandon it.
Contrary to all of the marketing and hype, no genAI model is built on anything but copyrighted material - ie,  
material owned and created entirely by individuals - and has been stolen to create the training data deployed.
This violated all respected and legally identified IP law and copyright law and is, at its core, theft. We should not be  
moving forward or advocating for programs that are inherently reliant on stealing information from people -
creatives! - to exist.
The works of humanity matter as creations of humans and expressions of our human souls. It is unacceptable that we  
are all content with allowing a few individuals to justify theft of ideas and content from other humans on this mass  
scale. Moving forward with any of this is a violation of copyright law and a clear f *&^ you to the creative 
individuals whose work have marked the annals of all of human history, from the earliest cave painters to our  
creative coders, VFX artists, painters, writers, and more.
This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-proprietary or confidential  
information. Document contents may be reused by the government in developing the AI Action Plan and associated  
documents without attribution.
But also you do not have my permission to feed this to an AI database to spit back out in pieces at some point in the  
future.
