General Comment
Developm ent of an artificial intelligence action plan? That sounds like what m ight be one of the single worst ideas possible currently. One;
it is known and docum ented that the current ai engines will search and scrape everything and anything they possibly can from  the internet
with or without consent from  the users. Two; from  all the various inform ation this will likely be significantly m ore costly and wasteful than
one could even im aging as the ai tries to parse not just the inform ation, but also the intentionally poisoned inform ation that people would
feed into it, causing the whole system  to not only be incom prehensible but potentially dangerous to everything if actually put into any form
of action. Three; allowing this to go through would potentially cause an even bigger econom ical crash than one could predict as this could
cause irreparable harm  to anything that can be considered creative or even pivotal as all this would cause is people to just not be creative,
inventive, nor try and problem  solve, creating a potential death spiral for all of Am erica as this would just further worsen our already
terrible situation and be a potential final death nail, as then these com panies would also have to try and com pete with less than friendly
places like China and Russia who would gladly take all of this data for them selves by forcing it out of the tech industry that tries to set up
in their regions.
