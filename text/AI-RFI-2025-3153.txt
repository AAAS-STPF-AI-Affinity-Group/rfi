General Comment
I am  very concerned about the activities of AI investors, developers and the corporations that own and operate such program s. I do not
grant any AI perm ission to steal m y personal inform ation and the data I post online as a private citizen. AI steals from  m y livelihood and
profits off m y privacy, and I feel that em bracing it is a violation of m y rights. I do not believe it has any place in the future of the United
States or otherwise.
