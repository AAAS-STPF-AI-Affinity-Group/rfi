General Comment
AI data centers consum e large am ounts of electricity. They are usually put in areas with lower energy prices, but then drive up rates for
everyone due to the large dem and.
The am ount of energy needed will stress our electric grid and if electricity is scarce, this business will get priority over citizens.
The increased need for energy will give energy com panies the leverage to increase burning fossil fuels, causing air quality to plum m et and
increase carbon em issions. 
I fear that the short sightedness of this endeavor will not address needed infrastructure updates, which will end up hurting the com m unities
these centers are forced into.
