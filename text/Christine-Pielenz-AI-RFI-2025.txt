To whom it may concern: I would like to encourage a focus on reducing energy consumption and 
increasing efficiency as a highest priority policy action that should be in the new AI Action Plan. 
Data centers should mitigate the carbon emissions associated wi th AI's energy consumption by 
transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar or wind and adopting energy -efficient 
practices. AI must have net zero emissions to keep pace with international climate goals. Sincerely, 
Christine Pielenz
