General Comment
If the general public can’t avoid copyright restrictions, then Open AI should not be able to as well. It’s as sim ple as that. 
And I don’t think your corporate cash cows will appreciate their content being stolen and used for m alicious purposes either. Disney,
Meta, and other corporations will stop giving you that sweet cash flow.
