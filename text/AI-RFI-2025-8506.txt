General Comment
The use of generative AI, especially unregulated, is the greatest known threat to our freedom  of individual and collective expresssion and
individual right to own that which we produce ourselves. Tim e and tim e again as this fledgling industry grows, it is found that AI technology
is used to illegally steal and copy art, im personate our voices, and even produce fraudulent video content. If our governm ent truly valued
the m erits of it's great citizenry and their labors, it would seek to regulate generative AI technology so that it could possibly im prove
specific aspects of our business endeavors, and not steal away the livelihoods of our great creatives.
