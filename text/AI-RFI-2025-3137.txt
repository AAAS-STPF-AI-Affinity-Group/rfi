General Comment
I do not believe that AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica. AI is trained on stolen data and art, is exceptionally bad for the
environm ent, and is dangerous to hum an beings with the am ount of m isinform ation being presented as absolute facts. AI is not the way or
the future and the governm ent should be upholding the current copyright laws and NOT allow big tech AI com panies any further liberties
to steal peopleâ€™s work to repackage as inferior products.
