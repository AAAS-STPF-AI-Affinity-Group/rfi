General Comment
I believe AI has no place in the United States governm ent or any industry. All it does is deprive the Am erican workers of their livelihoods
and seeks to spread m isinform ation and propaganda by people who do not hold the interests of the Am erican people at heart. It is, to put
it bluntly, a scam . A ponzi schem e designed to line the pockets of wealthy investors and not enrich the public. Additionally, it is not a good
tool to help national security. It will actually increase the possibility of fraud and stolen identity cases, resulting in nefarious individuals to
utilize sensitive inform ation to break down our already shaky social structure. AI has no purpose other than to hasten the downfall of this
country.
