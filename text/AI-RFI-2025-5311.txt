General Comment
AI should not have the right to bypass copyright laws. A corporation stealing im ages or text owned by artists and individuals for their own
uses should be restricted to the sam e extent, whether the m aterial is used directly or fed into m achine learning. AI com panies can source
their learning m aterial through license free libraries or im age libraries that they already have legal access to, not any im age or text they can
scrape off the internet. I am  an artist, I should not have to worry about m y art taken by large corporations so they can use m y work for
their own financial gain at the detrim ent of individual citizens like m yself.
