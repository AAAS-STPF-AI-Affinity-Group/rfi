General Comment
AI is a tool that steals intellectual property, creative works, and even water and electricity. It's place should be lim ited, regulated, and
rigorously evaluated to ensure it is not stealing wages/profits from  others or harm ing people by existing/running.
It can't replace hum an creativity and ingenuity, and even if it could, it shouldn't.
