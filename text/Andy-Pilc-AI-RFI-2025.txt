To Whom It May Concern,
I’m writing as someone who cares deeply about the future of information, small businesses,
and independent creators. I don’t work for a major media company. I’m just someone whovalues real, human-created content—whether that’s a local news article, a trusted blog post,or a small business sharing expert knowledge.
Right now, AI companies are taking without giving back. They’re scraping content from
independent publishers, writers, and small business owners without permission orcompensation, all while claiming that AI is “the future.” But what kind of future are wetalking about?
Because if things keep going this way, here’s what will happen:• The open web will be flooded with lazy, AI-generated content that lacks real expertise,
fact-checking, or original thought.
• Small businesses and creators will be pushed out because their own words, ideas, and
work are being used against them—without payment.
• Misinformation will spread even faster because AI doesn’t know what’s true; it just repeats
what it finds.
The tech giants building these AI models know they rely on human-created content, yet they
refuse to invest in the very people who make AI possible. They spend billions on computingpower, but when it comes to paying for the data they extract, suddenly there’s no budget.Google and OpenAI could support independent creators in the same way they invest in AIinfrastructure—but they choose not to.
Worse, there’s no real way for creators to opt in or out of having their work used to train
AI. Google said they’d offer these controls in 2023, but they never did.
If AI is going to be part of the future, then we need to make sure it’s a future that:
Respects copyright and compensates creators
Supports small businesses, not just corporate media giants
Gives people real control over whether their content is used for AI training
Prioritizes human knowledge over auto-generated fluff
The open web wasn’t built on corporate greed. It was built on real people sharing real
experiences and expertise. If AI keeps taking without limits, that will disappear—and AI


itself will suffer, because it won’t have anything left to learn from.
Please don’t let AI be an excuse to strip-mine human creativity for corporate profit. The
future shouldn’t be built on shortcuts—it should be built on fairness.
Thank you,Andy Pilc
