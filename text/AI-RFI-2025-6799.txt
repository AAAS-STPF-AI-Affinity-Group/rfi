General Comment
The notion that AI training m ust ignore existing copyright law to be sufficiently agile relies on prem ises that are dubious at best. The first is
that the m arketplace cannot create and negotiate reasonably priced access to copyrighted m aterial, or find ways to scale that price for
low-budget startups and researchers. Of course they can. The second is that people will not voluntarily release or create data for AI
training. They already do, and will continue to do so.
What the current m arket leaders really seek is entrenchm ent of their position. This is not the free m arket, and it is not rewarding
innovation. It is rent-seeking and corruption.
