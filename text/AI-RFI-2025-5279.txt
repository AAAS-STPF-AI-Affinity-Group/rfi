General Comment
As an Am erican citizen, I am  against going through with this plan. This is com pletely contradictory to the current laws that are in place.
Copyright and intellectual property laws are param ount for all creative industries. Letting this plan go through will hurt those industries and
therefore hurt other Am erican industries and Am erican society at large.
