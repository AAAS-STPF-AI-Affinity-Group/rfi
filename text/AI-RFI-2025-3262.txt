General Comment
AI has shown to overall offer no real benefits to the public. These program s use, without perm ission, inform ation published across the web
and teach their AI to steal what m akes them  appealing only to then churn out a sub-optim al result. They need heavy regulation and the
educated public has shown they would m uch rather a real hum an being working on their products instead of a lazy plagiarized
regurgitation. The m ore we allow com panies and private sectors to use these program s without regulations, the m ore they will infringe on
real people's freedom s, properties, and opportunities. Com panies are sim ply using them  to try and m axim ize work output, and m inim ize
the resources to do them , which really translates to, taking people's jobs, and releasing a lower quality product. Regulate AI, pay real
people, respect real people, com panies are not people.
