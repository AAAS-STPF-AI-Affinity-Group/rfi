General Comment
"AI" and "innovation" are words that don't belong in the sam e room , let alone the sam e sentence. "AI" as touted by com panies like Google
and OpenAI is just a plagiarism  m achine that burns stupid am ounts of energy to produce incorrect inform ation. Resources spent
supporting the AI grift would be better spent on alm ost literally anything else, and changing the law to allow them  unrestricted theft helps
no one.
