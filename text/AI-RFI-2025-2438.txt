General Comment
I believe AI poses both a m onetary and existential threat to every industry im aginable. Training AI with copyrighted content is theft and
should be punishable by the law, not prom oted and allowed by the US governm ent. It should also be illegal for com panies to train AI with
their users personal data without the explicit consent of said users. It is a breach of trust and privacy, and com panies like Google, Meta,
X, and so on, should be held liable.
