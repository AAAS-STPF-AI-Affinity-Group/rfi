General Comment
As a united states citizen I think generative AI has its place in the fields of research and science, I however believe that generative AI
being to used to replace artists, writers, anim ators, actors, voice actors, program m ers and other such creatives should not be the focus of
AI advancem ent because it just leads to the degradation of all form s of art, including video gam es, m ovies, TV shows, cartoons and
books. We have been seeing AI create pure slop while actual artists are struggling to get by.
In m y personal opinion I believe that we should shift the m ain focus of Generative AI to aiding in research in the fields of m edicine and
science,and banning, or at least heavily restricting generative AI's involvem ent in the arts. 
We should leave the joy of creation and creativity to actual hum ans or else all of our entertainm ent will becom e creepy uncanny slop.
