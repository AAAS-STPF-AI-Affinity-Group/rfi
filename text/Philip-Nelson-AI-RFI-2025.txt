Current AI learning systems are notorious for scraping the internet of all accessible content, thus 
exploiting without permission works created by people such as freelance artists. Furthermore, AI 
content generation now competes with those same freelancers , having used their work to learn 
how to do so. What if AI corporations hired people to create content specifically for AI 
consumption and training? Not only could this provide new employment opportunities, while 
resulting in good will in the impacted free lance communities, but it could also provide higher 
quality training for AI, as people discover ways to feed AI better input. In addition, corporations 
could post bounties for public -domain works not currently available on the internet, such as old 
books, journals, and letters. Scanning them into electronic format would provide more unique 
content for AI consumption, employ more people, and raise the possibility of releasing the works 
to the public for the general benefit of the human race.
