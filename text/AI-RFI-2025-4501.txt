General Comment
The purpose of Executive Order 14179 is to legalize the theft of intellectual property of the Am erican people. Executive Order 14179
disguises this fact by calling the protections of the intellectual property of the Am erican people a "barrier to Am erican leadership." It is
noted that these protections are, in fact, a barrier to dictatorship. As such, Executive Order 14179 and com pliance therewith are attacks
on the rights of the Am erican people.
