AI Action Plan for Identifying Potential Voter Fraud in Elections  
 
1. Objectives & Use Cases  
 
The objective of this AI Action Plan  is to enhance the integrity, security, and transparency  of 
elections by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to identify anomalies, fraud risks, and policy 
violations  in voting processes. AI can assist in detecting voting irregularities, duplicate or 
fraudulent ballots, and potential manipulation  while ensuring compliance with election laws.  
 
Key AI Use Cases:  
• Throughput Analysis for Polling Sites  – AI verifying whether the number of votes cast exceeds 
the maximum possible throughput based on site capacity and voting times.  
• Voter Eligibility Verification  – AI cross-checking votes against citizenship status, deceased 
voter records, and residency databases.  
• Mail-In vs. In-Person Vote Conflict Detection  – AI detecting if an individual voted both by 
mail and in person.  
• Cross-State Voting Identification  – AI matching voter records to prevent individuals from 
voting in multiple states.  
• Late Vote Submission Analysis  – AI flagging ballots submitted after official deadlines.  
• Bulk Vote Submission Detection  – AI recognizing abnormal clusters of ballots from the same 
mailing address or handwriting patterns.  
• Ballot Signature & Handwriting Verification  – AI analyzing ballot signatures for potential 
forgery. 
• Anomalous Voter Registration Pattern Detection  – AI identifying suspicious spikes in voter 
registrations in specific areas.  
• Geospatial Analysis of Voting Patterns  – AI identifying inconsistencies in voter turnout by 
location. 
• Election Night Vote Dump Analysis  – AI detecting sudden spikes in vote counts inconsistent 
with expected reporting timelines.  


2. Assessment of Current Capabilities  
• Evaluate existing election security and fraud detection mechanisms  in federal, state, and local 
election offices.  
• Assess AI readiness and data -sharing gaps  between election commissions, government 
agencies, and law enforcement.  
• Identify inefficiencies in manual vote verification processes  (e.g., signature matching, voter roll 
updates). 
• Analyze coordination challenges between state election offices and federal agencies.  
3. Technology & Infrastructure Requirements  
• AI-powered anomaly detection models  – Identifying voting patterns inconsistent with historical 
data. 
• Machine learning models for voter verification  – Cross-referencing voter rolls with databases 
of deceased individuals, non -citizens, and duplicate registrations.  
• Computer vision for handwriting and signature verification  – Detecting fraudulent ballots in 
mail-in voting.  
• Natural Language Processing (NLP) for address and name validation  – Ensuring consistency in 
voter registration data.  
• Secure blockchain -based voting record tracking  – Enhancing transparency in ballot submission 
and tabulation.  
• Geospatial AI analysis for turnout anomalies  – Identifying unusual voting behaviors in specific 
regions. 
• AI-driven predictive analytics  – Flagging counties or precincts at high risk of irregularities.  
4. Data Strategy  
• Integrate voter registration and election data across states and federal agencies.  
• Develop AI -powered predictive models  for identifying voter fraud risks.  
• Enhance real -time anomaly detection  in ballot tabulation and reporting.  
• Implement AI -powered monitoring for mail -in ballot integrity.  
• Ensure AI -driven data protection  to prevent election system breaches.  


5. Governance & Ethics  
• Establish AI governance frameworks  to ensure fair, unbiased, and transparent election security.  
• Ensure compliance with federal and state election laws  regarding voter privacy and data use.  
• Develop non -partisan AI audit mechanisms  for election fraud detection models.  
• Mitigate AI bias risks  to prevent unjust disenfranchisement of legitimate voters.  
6. Workforce & Training  
• Train election officials and auditors  on AI-assisted fraud detection tools.  
• Develop AI training programs  for election security teams and law enforcement.  
• Deploy AI -powered decision support tools  for election monitoring.  
7. Implementation Roadmap  
 
Phase 1 (0 -12 Months)  
• Deploy AI pilot projects in key swing states  for fraud detection in upcoming elections.  
• Integrate AI-driven voter verification systems  with existing election databases.  
• Establish an AI Election Integrity Task Force  to oversee implementation.  
 
Phase 2 (1 -3 Years) 
• Expand AI-driven mail -in ballot verification  nationwide.  
• Deploy AI-powered anomaly detection  in real-time election monitoring.  
• Enhance cross-state voter data sharing  to prevent duplicate voting.  
 
Phase 3 (3 -5 Years) 
• Fully implement AI-driven voter fraud detection models  in all state and federal elections.  


• Develop blockchain -based voting transparency solutions.  
• Strengthen AI-enhanced cybersecurity  for election infrastructure.  
8. Risk Management  
• Cybersecurity threats  – AI-driven threat detection for election systems.  
• False positives in fraud detection  – Human oversight for AI -flagged anomalies.  
• AI bias concerns  – Regular audits and fairness testing for fraud detection models.  
• Legal & ethical challenges  – Ensuring AI use aligns with voter privacy laws.  
9. Monitoring & Optimization  
• Define AI performance KPIs  (e.g., fraud detection accuracy, reduction in election anomalies).  
• Deploy AI -driven election monitoring dashboards  for real-time fraud detection.  
• Continuously improve AI models  based on historical election data and new fraud patterns.  
10. Change Management & Adoption  
• Engage federal, state, and local election agencies  to coordinate AI -driven election security.  
• Develop bipartisan oversight committees  for AI election monitoring.  
• Launch public awareness initiatives  on AI-driven election integrity measures.  
This AI Action Plan for Election Fraud Detection  will enhance voting integrity, fraud prevention, 
and transparency  while ensuring a fair, secure, and trustworthy electoral process.
