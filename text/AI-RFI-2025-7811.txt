General Comment
I strongly oppose AI as it is a rogue technology that steals inform ation and content from  creatives, writers, m usicians, and others. AI
com panies cannot be allowed to be exem pt from  serious consequences for breaking copyright laws. Intellectual property rights should
never be violated nor given to AI com panies without com pensating the original owners.
