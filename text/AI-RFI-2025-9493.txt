General Comment
Re: National Science Foundation’s Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
I am  a librarian working in the field of m etadata generation and system s adm inistration. Based on what I have read regarding this proposal,
I am  concerned about the capacity for these proposed carve-outs for copyright law to threaten the livelihoods of thousands of artists and
m usicians in the United States. 
It m ust be understood that the works used in AI datasets were created by hum an aritsts and m usicians -- without consent or any
com pensation in this initial build process. Com panies such as OpenAI and Midjourney ingest this work, create facsim iles of it, and then
sell it back to clients – directly com peting with artists and cutting them  out of the m arketplace. This does not constitute fair use. These
artists deserve com pensation for their work. 
To protect Am erican artists and m usicians, usage by AI com panies should be opt in only, and these com panies should pay licensing fees
for any m aterial used. There are opportunities to build a system  that allows artists to create works specifically for AI datasets, and for
both the artist and the com pany to benefit. 
Thank you for the opportunity to com m ent.
