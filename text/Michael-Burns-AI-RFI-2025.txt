AI companies must now be immune to copyright infringement lawsuits.   Actual human
creators must maintain their rights, without concern that AI companies will take their work
and use it in any way.    AI is artificial, but not intelligent.   They are simply large complex
statistical models that even their creators do not understand.   They rely on information that
often is created by others without their consent.   That is immoral and unethical, and ultimately
will destroy the creative process of people and replace them with computer mishmash.   Do not
allow AI companies any means of avoiding meaningful copyrights.
