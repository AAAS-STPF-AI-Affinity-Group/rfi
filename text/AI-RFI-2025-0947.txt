General Comment
Hum an intelligence com es from  the divine. We create using our innate intuition from  the One soul within all of us. Deeply contem plating
brings divine answers. AI wishes to underm ine God. It m akes people into frauds, writing books for them  etc. It's good for m aking
pictures. But to rely on it for anything that hum ans could pervert for their own gain, is wrong.
