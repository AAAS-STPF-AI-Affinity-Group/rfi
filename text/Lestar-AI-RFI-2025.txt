LLMs and similiar "AI" models are created through the wholesale violation of
copyright.Unless they create a paid opt-in model for contributing to data sets, they are creatingtheir models through theft.If it's not legal to download a movie off the internet, it's not legal to scape it to feedthese models.Additionally: they are weighted models and don't actually learn. Saying they do ismisleading, bordering on fraud.
