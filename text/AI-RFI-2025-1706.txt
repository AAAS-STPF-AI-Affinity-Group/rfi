RE:  The A I Trust Foundation's Comments on President Trump's National AI 
Plan Executive Order 14179  
Dear D r. Prabhakar,  
On beh alf of T he AI Trust Foundation  for Beneficial AI , thank you for the opportunity to 
share comments on the Trump Administration's Executive Order 14179 —Removing Barriers to 
American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI) . With the global AI market projected to 
reach $15.7 trillion, strategic action now will sustain and grow America's global leadership in 
AI innovation, governance, and talent.  
The A I Trust Foundation  for Beneficial AI  
Founde d in 2023, T he AI Trust Foundation is the leading independent organization dedicated 
to accelerating AI's beneficial uses and positive impact . Under the leadership of Chair 
Emeritus California State Senator Jerry McNerney, Ph.D. —mathematician, former U.S. 
Congressman, and auth or of the landmark AI in Government Act — the AI Trust Foundation is 
the only organization  uniting AI innovators large and small, e ducational and research 
institutions, and global investors across the entire AI ecosystem to speed up the path to real -
world AI solutions which make a positive difference .   
To supp ort our mission, The AI Trust Foundation  collaborates with leaders across  industries -- 
healthcare, energy, national security, transportation, education,  and more – to help 
individuals, businesses, researchers, and policymakers access  AI solutions responsibly and 
effectively.   O ur powerhouse alliance  includes RedCloud Technology, Box  Inc, Microsoft, 
the Edison Foundation, the U.S. -Qatar Business Council  (USQBC) , the Cyber Readiness 
Institute, and a wide  range of institutions developing America's nex t generation of AI 
talent .   


Our Un ique Platform  
The AI  Trust Foundation is a unique platform  in the $15.7 trillion global AI market , 
offering Members:  
•Excl usive opportunities to showcase American AI technology
•Unique partnerships with  AI pioneers,  policymakers,  academic innovators, and
entrepreneurs,  and
•Useful market insights and access to shape policy  before regulations are written .
Benef icial AI: Shaping the Future for Good  
The AI  Trust Foundation is working to accelerat e real-world AI solutions  across industries:  
•Heal thcare : AI is enabling earlier disease detection, expediting drug discovery,
powering precision medicine, and extending healthy lifespans.
•Infrastructure : From self -monitoring bridges to optimized traffic, AI is ushering in a
more modern, resilient America.
•Government Services : AI is improving  citizen services. From reducing patent
backlogs to providing 24/7 digital assistance, AI can power a responsive and efficient
public sector.
•Energy : Smart grid AI is stabilizing power supply, fusion breakthroughs are within
reach, and predictive AI is enhancing climate resilience. Our sustainable energy future isnow possible.
•Agriculture : AI and precision farming are sowing the seeds for a productive, profitable
agricultural revolution.
To deliver AI's full benefits, public trust must be the priority  and AI must be developed 
responsibly, with strong safeguards. Just as Madison and our Founding Fathers established 
enduring principles of constitutional governance, we need a framework where AI innovation flourishes within structured limits, reinforcing democratic values. With public trust, we can 
unlock AI's full benefits.  
Our Strategic Recommendations for President Trump’s National AI Plan  
We prop ose three strategic initiatives for immediate collaboration with the Trump 
Administration to accelerate beneficial AI:  
1.Steer  investment  in beneficial American AI technologies through a n innovative
SelectUSA Industry Partnership
2.Develop American talent  through our National AI Talent Initiative
3.Lead global governance  through our Global AI Principles
These t hree complementary pillars —investment, talent, and governance —form a 
comprehensive strategy to secure America's AI leadership, with our SelectUSA Industry 
Partnership serving as the economic engine to fuel innovation across the AI ecosystem.  


1. Dr ive Investment in American AI Innovation
The AI  Trust Foundation seeks designation as a SelectUSA AI Industry Partner  to help 
America capture the $15.7 trillion global AI market opportunity .  Our partnership will:  
•Cataly ze new AI investments in American AI  leveraging our strategic alliances,
including our landmark MOU with the U.S. -Qatar Business Council (USQBC) ,
•Showcas e American excellence through our BETTY Awards for Beneficial ,
Technology,  highlighting breakthrough innovations in healthcare, transportation,
government, small business , and other industries, and
•Support the Stargate Initiative  by strengthening critical AI infrastructure, bridging
AI and energy ecosystems, and accelerating development of fusion and other clean
technologies to secure America's computational advantage .
2. Bu ild America's AI Professional  Advantage
To main tain global leadership, the U.S. must develop world -class AI professionals . We invite 
the Administration to join our National AI Talent Initiative , coordinat ing scholarships, 
curricula, and apprenticeships to prepare American s for AI careers : 
•Prepa re 100,000 AI -skilled professionals by 2027 through our network of 35+
educational, research, and cultural institutions, creating regional AI talent hubs ,
•Build specialized AI career pathways connecting universities, community colleges ,
minority -serving institutions, and industry partners , and
•Expand  our innovative "AI 101" training programs ensuring every American can access
foundational AI knowledge and professional opportunities in this high -growth sector .
3. Ame rican Leadership in Global AI Governance
AI wil l only yield its full benefits if the public trusts these technologies.   Inspired by James 
Madison's vision of governance  which balanced innovation with structured 
safeguards, our Global AI Principles  initiative presents a unique opportunity to assert 
U.S. leadership in shaping international AI norms and standards to ensure enduring 
democratic stability.  
By wor king with allies across Europe, Japan, India, the Middle East, and other democracies, 
we can champion a common framework for responsible AI  which  strengthens alliances and 
technological partnerships.   We recommend the Administration adopt the AI Trust 
Foundation's Global AI Principles  as the foundation for international standards which:  
•Preve nt overregulation  by balancing innovation with responsible safeguards
through smart private -public partnerships  and
•Position the U.S.  as the global authority on AI governance.
