General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. It is not
trained on legally copyrighted art, writing, videos, m usic, and m ore. It illegally scraps content it has no right to without the creator's
consent and sells it as its own creation. That is theft, plagiarism , counterfeit, and sells a worse product than what it stole from . AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. It cannot capture nuance and em otion like people can, and if these com panies
cannot continue to function without stealing from  others then it isn't good or som ething the US governm ent should be endorsing. If the US
governm ent believes that AI should be able to steal whatever it wants for training purposes it will open up corporations and the US
governm ent to enorm ous levels of corruption, and tells the public they have no rights or property because oligarchs get to decide what is
and isn't theirs.
