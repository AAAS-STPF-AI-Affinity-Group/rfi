About  GitLab  
GitLab  is the most  comprehensive  AI-powered  DevSecOps  platform.  Founded  in 2011, 
GitLab  provides  a single  platform  for version  control,  continuous  integration,  
deployment,  monitoring,  security  and Artificial  Intelligence,  all integrated  into a unified  
interface.  GitLab  offers a complete,  scalable  solution  that enables  teams  to collaborate  
seamlessly  from planning  to production.  GitLab’ s open-core  platform  helps  
organizations  deliver  software  faster  and more  efficiently  while  strengthening  their 
security  and compliance.  
1. Prioritizing  and Accelerating  Government  Access  to Commercial  AI Solutions  
Given  the current  administration’ s strong  focus  on modernizing  legacy  systems  and 
increasing  government  efficiency , we urge you to institute  an efficient  framework  to 
prioritize  the authorization  of commercial  cloud-based  systems  which  implement  
Artificial  Intelligence  for use by government  agencies.  Such  a framework  (likely  as part 
of FedRAMP)  would  benefit  from prioritization.  
Continued  AI leadership  depends  on the government  prioritizing  and simplifying  access  
to cutting-edge  technology  through  streamlined  acquisition  processes,  which  will 
simultaneously  improve  governmental  efficiency . Not only can commercial  systems  
replace  numerous  legacy  government  systems,  but also the use of AI-augmented  
platforms  can dramatically  increase  productivity  and decrease  personnel  requirements  
when  modernizing  applications  and transitioning  them  to modern,  memory  safe 
programming  languages.  Further , commercial  cloud  software  systems  offer users  the 
most  recent  and secure  versions  of software  while  freeing  agencies  from maintenance  
responsibilities.  
2. Encouraging  Government/Industry  Collaboration  
 
While  collaboration  is frequently  discussed  in public  forums,  the partnership  between  
industry  and government  contains  immense  opportunity  for growth.  To strengthen  
collaboration  between  public  and private  organizations,  consider  continued  solicitation  
from industry  such  as this RFI. The open-ended  nature  of this particular  RFI enables  
industry  to share  prioritized  feedback  within  their area of expertise  with fewer  RFI 
boundary  limitations.  
 
Collaboration  can further  be elevated  through  enhanced  knowledge  sharing.  Recent  
bills, such  as the SHARE  IT Act and the OPEN  Government  Data  Act, encourage  code  
sharing  and data sharing  within  government  agencies  - in many  cases  sharing  that data 
with industry  and with the constituency . We would  similarly  encourage  consideration  of 
the formation  of open  forums,  working  groups,  workshops,  and events  focused  on 
2 

furthering  AI leadership,  security , and standards  where  government  and industry  can 
collaborate  continuously .  
 
3. Understanding  AI’s Strengths  and Opportunities  for Innovation  
Generative  AI systems  today  excel  at rapidly  generating  configuration,  initiating  
projects,  providing  solutions,  and analyzing  requirements.  This can serve  as a strong  
foundation  - what  might  constitute  the first 50-70%  of a project  or task.  AI systems  can 
quickly  process  large  amounts  of historical  information  through  model  training  and 
inference,  producing  coherent  outputs  that follow  patterns  they've  learned.  However , 
these  systems  typically  fall short  of delivering  completely  polished,  contextually  
appropriate  results  because  they lack the ability  to innovate  and to truly understand  a 
human's  ultimate  vision  or intended  direction.  
The remaining  30-50%  of AI-led  project  work  then requires  human  refinement,  
judgment,  creativity , and iteration.  Humans  bring  crucial  context  about  their specific  
needs,  organizational  culture,  audience  expectations,  and long-term  goals  - elements  
that AI does  not readily  provide.  Further , by shifting  the initial  50-70%  of an effort to AI, it 
gives  people  increased  opportunity  to innovate  and enhance  the initial  AI output  to 
produce  bold,  new solutions  that AI could  not have  been  trained  on, simultaneously  
improving  employee  engagement  and satisfaction.  
4. Governance  Through  Transparency  for Data  Protection  
The protection  of intellectual  property  and data sovereignty  has become  a crucial  
consideration  as organizations  adopt  AI technologies.  Open  and transparent  AI 
statements,  particularly  those  with clear  data handling  policies  and geographical  
restrictions,  provide  organizations  with the confidence  to leverage  these  tools  without  
compromising  proprietary  or classified  information.  Organizations  should  make  informed  
decisions  about  which  AI systems  to use based  on explicit  vendor  statements  about  
data retention,  model  training  practices,  and geographical  data storage  locations.  
A comprehensive  example  of clearly  explaining  data handling,  privacy , and continuity  is 
publicly  available  in GitLab’ s AI Transparency  Center . 
Organizations  are increasingly  seeking  AI solutions  that offer contractual  guarantees  
against  using  their data for model  training  or sharing  it with foreign  entities  (DeepSeek,  
for example).  This is especially  important  for the government,  for industries  with 
sensitive  intellectual  property , and for those  subject  to strict  regulatory  requirements.  
The ability  to choose  AI systems  that maintain  data within  specific  geographical  
boundaries  (like the US, EU, or UK) helps  organizations  comply  with data protection  
regulations  while  still benefiting  from AI capabilities.

Some  companies  and agencies  require  especially  strict  data protection  and/or  
regulation,  including  government  classified  systems  which  cannot  be connected  to the 
Internet  to leverage  many  AI services.  These  organizations  should  look to host AI 
models  within  their own data centers  so that sensitive  data never  leaves  their networks.  
While  there  is more  overhead  required  with this solution  than using  commercial  cloud  
services,  the data privacy  and control  advantages  are unquestioned.  Further , the ability  
to match  specific  models  to your organization’ s individual  needs  can bring  rewards  in 
terms  of performance  optimization  and resource  utilization.  A self-hosted  AI solution  
also offers the option  of incorporating  Open  Source  Software  models  for those  users  
who place  trust in such  architectures  and/or  those  looking  to control  costs.  
Hybrid  solutions  may also be considered.  For example,  initial  software  development  can 
be completed  on an unclassified,  Internet-connected  system  which  then gets 
automatically  synchronized  via a one-way  low-to-high  diode  for completion  of classified  
development  using  air-gapped  self-hosted  AI models.  This granular  control  over data 
exposure  allows  organizations  to balance  the benefits  of AI assistance  with their 
security  requirements.  
5. Increasing  Efficiency  via AI (Software  Development  Use Case)  
Generative  AI can be harnessed  throughout  the SDLC  to increase  the efficiency  of 
modern  software  development,  model  development,  and open  source  development.  
AI-powered  code  suggestions  and completions  help developers  write  code  faster . When  
reviewing  code,  AI can automatically  analyze  changes,  summarize  team  comments,  
suggest  improvements,  and even  explain  complex  code  segments  to reviewers,  
significantly  accelerating  the review  process.  
In the software  testing  domain,  AI can generate  test cases  and testing  frameworks  
based  on the application  code,  reducing  the time developers  spend  on test creation  
while  improving  coverage.  Similarly , AI can automatically  generate  and update  
documentation  as code  changes,  keeping  technical  documentation  in sync with the 
codebase  without  requiring  manual  intervention.  This is particularly  valuable  for 
maintaining  accurate  documentation  in fast-moving  projects.  
Software  security  can also be implemented  more  efficiently  using  AI capabilities,  as it 
can consistently  identify  potential  vulnerabilities  during  the development  itself,  before  
code  is checked  in and reviewed.  AI can explain  identified  security  issues  to the 
developer  and either  suggest  remediation  or automate  remediation  of known  
vulnerabilities  completely . By integrating  these  AI features  directly  into existing  
workflows,  teams  can maintain  their existing  processes  while  gaining  significant  
efficiency  improvements.

6. Modernizing  Legacy  Systems  using  AI (Software  Refactoring  Use Case)  
Another  critical  software-related  use case  for Generative  AI is the role it can play in 
modernizing  legacy  systems,  dramatically  reducing  technical  debt while  maintaining  
ongoing  operations.  AI-powered  software  development  can analyze  existing  codebases  
to insert  missing  comments  and documentation,  quickly  remediate  security  
vulnerabilities,  propose  opportunities  for improvement,  and suggest  specific  
modernization  approaches.  This automated  analysis  helps  teams  prioritize  which  
aspects  of their legacy  systems  need  immediate  attention  versus  what  can be 
addressed  over time.  AI’s ability  to understand  context  means  it can suggest  
incremental  improvements  that align  with the team's  current  modernization  efforts;  
however , AI-powered  DevSecOps  can also contribute  substantially  to the complete  
refactoring  of older  codebases  into Memory  Safe Languages  (MSL)  in keeping  with the 
urging  of most  cybersecurity  professionals.  
7. Using  AI to Augment  the Workforce  
Generative  AI-enabled  platforms  enable  smaller  teams  to accomplish  more  by acting  as 
a force  multiplier  across  multiple  activities.  AI assistance  in the software  development  
lifecycle  scenario  can make  teams  more  efficient  in several  key ways,  which  also 
translates  to other  use cases  that can leverage  generative  AI: 
a) Automated  code  generation  - AI can automate  code  creation,  complete  functions,  
and even  generate  entire  components  based  on requirements,  reducing  manual  
effort and workload  for staff while  diminishing  the need  for additional  personnel  
for new or complex  projects.  Model  quality  is essential  for optimal  coding  inputs  
from AI. Model  training  transparency  with auditable  development  processes  is 
highly  desirable  to minimize  risk of malicious  inclusions.  
b) AI-led  legacy  application  refactoring  - AI-powered  software  development  features  
a built-in  refactoring  capability  which  can reduce  code  complexity , improve  
performance,  simplify  the modernization  of 3rd party  components,  or even  
translate  entire  codebases  from an outdated  programming  language  to a more  
modern  one. A capability  such  as this opens  the door to modernization  and 
innovation  on projects  where  it could  not be previously  considered  due to 
workforce  limitations,  project  length,  and overall  risk. 
c) Accelerated  debugging  and root cause  analysis  - AI can identify  bugs,  explain  
security  vulnerabilities,  suggest  fixes,  and explain  code  behavior , allowing  
developers  to solve  problems  and remediate  vulnerabilities  far more  quickly , 
independently , and efficiently  without  having  to rely heavily  on security  staff to 
review  all issues.  AI-assisted  troubleshooting  in any context  can not only save  
substantial  time for users,  but it can also minimize  handof fs to other  teams  and 
the associated  efficiency  losses  due to context  switching.

d) Automated  testing  - AI can generate  test cases  for newly  written  code,  relieving  
the developer  from having  to spend  time on this onerous  task.  More  thorough  
validation  of any work  prior to its deployment  into real-world  applications  can 
save  significant  cost and disruption  risk after rollout.  
e) Augmented  code  reviews  - AI can identify  the best team  members  to perform  
reviews  while  quickly  summarizing  the changes  and comments  made  by other  
team  members,  decreasing  the time required  for each  review . Generative  AI is 
not a replacement  for humans,  but it can augment  their work  substantially  by 
prioritizing  work,  identifying  unseen  risks and enabling  more  holistic,  
comprehensive  outcomes.  
f) Just-in-time  knowledge  - Developers  can leverage  AI to access  expertise  and 
best practices  in the context  of their work,  closing  skill gaps  and reducing  
reliance  on senior  developers.  Accessing  AI within  the context  of daily work  
enables  more  effective  task execution,  more  efficient  ideation,  and a means  to 
rapidly  overcome  issues  that block  work.  Sufficient  data center  power , adequate  
compute,  general  systems  availability , and worker  enablement  are critical  to 
unlocking  this efficiency  at scale,  particularly  as agentic  AI and other  “always  on” 
AI applications  are being  deployed.  
g) Rapid  onboarding  - New team  members  can begin  contributing  sooner , and 
existing  teams  can more  easily  integrate  new members,  maintaining  productivity  
during  personnel  turnovers.  Turning  to AI for answers  during  onboarding  
expedites  the time to contribute  for new employees  or for those  new in their role. 
h) Documentation  generation  - AI can create  and maintain  documentation,  API 
references,  and comments  automatically , freeing  developers  from these  
time-consuming  tasks.  Documentation  generation  is a significant  value  that AI 
presents  in all work  contexts.  
The most  significant  efficiency  gains  come  from allowing  developers  to focus  on 
high-level  architecture  and business  logic while  AI handles  repetitive  implementation  
details.  This doesn't  eliminate  the need  for developers,  but it does  allow  smaller  teams  
to accomplish  multiples  more  work  while  maintaining  high standards  across  all aspects  
of development.  The software  development  scenario  can be imagined  across  many  
other  roles  and industries  to provide  similar  gains  and outcomes,  providing  clear  
rationale  for requiring  comprehensive  AI model  and system  transparency  before  use. 
8. Research  to Support  Secure  AI 
A final topic  that is particularly  important  is continued  research  into the security  
implications  of generative  AI use in software  development.  Executive  Order  14144  
tasked  NIST , the Department  of Energy , the DHS  Science  and Technology  Directorate,  
and the National  Science  Foundation  with prioritizing  research  into the security  of AI 
6 

coding  assistance,  including  the security  of AI-generated  code.  Given  the clear  future  of 
pervasive  use of generative  AI in software  development,  it is critical  that the US 
Government  do everything  it can to ensure  the security  of such  code,  especially  for 
deployment  into critical  infrastructure  and National  Security  Systems,  and to prevent  the 
unintentional  or malicious  introduction  of insecure  code  via AI models.  
Conclusion  
In summary , the integration  of AI to daily work  represents  a transformative  opportunity  
for government  efficiency , modernization,  and global  competitiveness.  By establishing  
frameworks  that prioritize  government  access  to commercial  AI technologies,  we can 
enable  smaller  teams  to accomplish  more  while  maintaining  high standards  across  all 
aspects  of development.  The appropriate  balance  of AI augmentation  with human  
expertise  creates  a powerful  synergy  that accelerates  innovation  while  addressing  the 
critical  personnel  challenges  facing  government  IT departments.  
To maximize  these  benefits,  we recommend  that the AI Action  Plan emphasize  
transparent  governance  frameworks,  support  for diverse  deployment  models  that 
protect  intellectual  property  and data sovereignty , and continued  research  into AI code  
security . These  measures  will ensure  that AI adoption  serves  the public  interest  while  
enhancing  national  security  and economic  competitiveness.  GitLab  stands  ready  to 
support  the government  in implementing  these  recommendations  and advancing  the 
responsible  development  and application  of AI technologies.
