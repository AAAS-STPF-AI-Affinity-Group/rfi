General Comment
This docum ent is approved for public dissem ination. The docum ent contains no business-proprietary or confidential inform ation.
Docum ent contents m ay be 
reused by the governm ent in developing the AI Action Plan and associated docum ents without attribution.
The sim plest and best thing to do for "Artificial Intelligence" policy is to ban it, categorize anything m ade with it as public dom ain, and
rigorously pursue technologies that verify content is genuine.
Without policies of this kind, we are preparing United States society to have false inform ation that has the appearance of being real but
only has m any dangers associated with it.
