General Comment
This is an incredibly dangerous act that will take away work from  m illions of Am ericans and further tank the econom y. Additionally, letting
AI train on copywritten m aterial is highly unethical and unlawful. Will disney be happy that their work can be derived on? Will they
support people using AI to create harm ful, pornographic ‘art’ with their characters that is accessible to children on the Internet? I don’t
think so. I urge every person who will m ake decisions around this to consider the harm ful, long lasting reach som ething like this will have
on the youth, professionals, and all decent Am ericans.
