This request potentially holds the unintended or possibly intended AI invasion of privacy and
theft of personal information from the general public, with no redress of grievances.  
I'm a poet, online content producer and blogger.
ChatGPT and DallE are regularly and thoroughly debunked as producing fake and fake
information while presenting it as fact.   This is perjury in any court, and were i to undertake
such an operation, I would be held liable.
Yet you wish to hold these harmful AI engines   harmless from blame while simultaneously
stealing information and feeding it to these untested and unreliable technology bots/,   while
ignoring the very real harm you bring to actual humans.  
These are   real people whose livelihood and reputation may be irrepably harmed, with no
redress or proper payment for intellectual property.   
I want it made perfectly clear: I   do NOT grant consent for ANY of my   present, past or
future  creations, my writings, my poetry, any of my published work, or any iteration of
my online presence to be used without my written and explicit permission and agreed
upon licensure, payment, and signed contract,   for each and every usage incident, in
whole or in part. The permission sought should be antecedent to use in every case.
FURTHER, I DENY IN PERPETUITY THE RIGHT OR REQUEST OF ANYGOVERNMENTAL AGENCY TO USE MY INFORMATION, ONLINE PRESENCE, ORCREATIVE WORKS, IN THIS MANNER. THESE TECHNOLOGIES SHOULD NOT BEENCOURAGED, AIDED, USED, OR SUBSIDIZED
  BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ANY
WAY.
 I further grant NO license or permission for ANY AI technology platform, now present or
that may be released in future, to ignore my directions above.
