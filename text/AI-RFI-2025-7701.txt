General Comment
Generative AI has no place in the future of the United States. Theft is a serious crim e, whether it is done m
by a m achine or a person. GenAI is a plague on our society that is actively stripping creative individuals of their creative rights and desires
to continue m aking m asterpieces. This is such a horrible, *horrible* idea.
