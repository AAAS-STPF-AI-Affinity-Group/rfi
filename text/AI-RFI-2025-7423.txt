General Comment
While I feel that AI does have a place where it provides value, I feel that creators should have the option to opt their copyrighted m aterials
out of use to train AI and that this should be respected. Indiscrim inate training on unvetted data sets has m ajor security concerns and does
not support actual innovation by hum an creators.
