General Comment
As an artist, the idea of m y art or anyone else’s work is being used to train AI is abhorrent and appalling. The consideration of it, even, is
EXTREMELY disappointing. To even consider taking art, which people use their own soul and drive to create - whether it be painting,
m usic, drawing, dance, anything - and putting it into a com puter which m akes a worse and m eaningless product. Regardless of skill level,
artists and m usicians do not deserve to have their work stolen from  them  to be used by AI.
AI does not have the joy of hum an expression that com es from  creating. AI does not understand why art som etim es looks a certain way.
Why things sound the way they do. Why things m atter. AI has NO soul. AI doesn’t understand the process of creating, of learning a skill,
of applying that knowledge to what you do. It just does - which is why AI creating things from  m usic, prose, art, anything, is m eaningless.
Soulless. An abom ination of all things that m ake art, art. 
Even considering to use AI to replace hum anity shows what you lack: hum anity.
