General Comment
Hello I writing to voice m y firm ly held belief that AI cannot be allowed to have such free reign and is an active danger to the livelihoods of
writers, artists and com m on Am ericans.
The data insecurity and theft as m arked present dangers of AI in it's current state will only be exacerbated ten fold if allowed to
dangerously proliferate in such ways.
It is therefore the im perative of any responsible parties to put a stop to this.
