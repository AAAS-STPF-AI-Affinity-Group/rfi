General Comment
Do not give OpenAI im m unity from  copyright lawsuits. This would be legalized theft, allowing a few people to absolutely plunder the
protected works of others for profit. Moreover, AI is a trem endously wasteful use of precious natural resources. This would be like
allowing thieves to rob the Library of Congress using a m achine that burned down national parks as fuel.
