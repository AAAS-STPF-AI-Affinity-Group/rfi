General Comment
Generative AI com panies have already adm itted to stealing from  m y livelihood as an author and an Am erican. They intend to profit off of
that theft without com pensation.
The United States's greatness com es from  individual and collective achievem ent working toward the greater good. It does not com e from
the theft of individuals' hard work and intellectual property. Do not give OpenAI or other generative AI com panies the power to steal
from  others without com pensation.
Forcing generative AI into the workforce has resulted in worse products and worse results, including in m y line of work, which ends up
costing com panies m oney. It is the equivalent of sabotage to m y field and I have been forced to change software to rem ove it from  m y
workflow.
Generative AI is a com pletely speculative m arket that has yet to turn a profit despite m any hundreds of billions of dollars and years of
developm ent. Its powers are extrem ely lim ited, and it can't even do what it claim s to do. Studies have found that generative AI interfaces
like ChatGPT return incorrect answers about 60% of the tim e. Microsoft's own studies find that the use of generative AI leads to poorer
critical thinking and worse outcom es for em ployees that use it. The use of generative AI does not m ake this country great - in fact, it
actively m akes it worse but dum bing down our greatest resource, our citizens and workers.
There is a way to develop generative AI ethically, legally, and safely. This is not it.
