General Comment
Artificial intelligence as it is and as it has been used serves no benefit to m ankind as a whole. There is no point in attem pting to reach the
pinnacle of glorified predictive text and autom atic plagiarism  that any decent society should strive towards. If you wish to further cem ent all
the negative connotations already rooted in your culture by the present adm inistration, know you only further dem ean and debase the
entire nation and all the poor individuals saddled with the burden of being a part of it.
