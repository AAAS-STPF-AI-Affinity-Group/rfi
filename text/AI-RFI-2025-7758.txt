General Comment
I am  an artist whose life has been im pacted by generative AI. When I teach em broidery, I constantly encounter students and beginners
who have bought AI-generated patterns that do not actually work when they try to physically m ake the project. My partner is also an
artist and has lost incom e because people are using generative AI instead of com m issioning artists. Com panies developing generative AI
are also scraping m aterial they don’t have perm ission to use, essentially stealing the intellectual property of others in order to fuel a m odel
that will in turn reduce incom e for the sam e artists they stole m aterial from  in the first place. Any AI regulations going forward m ust ensure
ethical m aterial acquisition and protect intellectual property. We m ust have options to opt-out of having our works used to m ake AI, and
com panies should not be allowed to m ake m oney off of using others’ intellectual property.
