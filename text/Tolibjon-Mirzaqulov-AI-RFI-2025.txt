Recomendations in answer to  Request for Information 
(RFI) on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
Action Plan (“Plan”)  
Introduction  
My name is Tolibjon Mirzakulov, M.Sc on Economi cs, co-founder and CEO of Jett Investment 
Service. As an AI enthusiast, I strongly support  OSTP’s effort to define the priority policy 
actions needed to actively promote  artificial intelligence  with the support of US and other 
countries governments.  
My recommendations mainly focus on international standartisation  of AI tools and 
technologies.  
The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics marks a transformative era in 
human history. These technologies drive advancements across sectors —autonomous 
vehicles streamline transportation, robotic assistants enhance daily life, and AI -powered 
diagnostics revolutionize healthcare. The benefits are immense: increased efficiency, 
improved productivity, and elevated quality of life. Yet, this progress comes with challenges. 
As AI systems grow more autonomous and ubiquitous, ensuring their safety, security, 
privacy, and ethical alignment becomes paramount.  
Without standardized regulation, we risk a fragmented landscape where inconsistent 
practices undermine public trust and amplify vulnerabilities. The absence of unified 
protocols could lead to misuse, breaches of privacy, or even physical harm. This documen t 
proposes several recommendations to AI Regulation Action Plan, outlining six critical 
standards to address these challenges:  
1.Knowledge Sharing Protocols
2.Knowledge Classification

4.Restriction Standards
5.Commander Credibility Validation
6.Crime Detection and Reporting  (“911” for robots)
These standards aim to balance innovation with oversight, fostering a global framework that 
ensures AI serves humanity responsibly. This introduction sets the stage for a detailed 
exploration of each standard, culminating in a call for international cooper ation to secure 
AI’s future.  
Executive Summary  
This AI Regulation Action Plan presents six foundational standards to govern AI and robotics, 
ensuring their safe, ethical, and efficient integration into society:  
•Knowledge Sharing Protocols : Facilitate secure, efficient exchange of AI -learned
information to reduce redundancy and spur innovation.
•Knowledge Classification : Categorize AI -acquired knowledge to protect privacy and
regulate sharing permissions.
•Decision -Making Levels : Classify AI systems by autonomy to tailor regulatory
oversight and enhance safety.
•Restriction Standards : Establish universal commands to limit or shut down robotic
functions during emergencies.
•Commander Credibility Validation : Verify the authority of command issuers to
prevent misuse and ensure accountability.
•Crime Detection and 911 Reporting : Equip robots to detect and report illegal
activities to appropriate authorities consistently.
Designed for global adoption, these standards promote consistency, safety, and trust in AI 
systems. Together, they form a proactive strategy to harness AI’s potential while mitigating 
its risks, urging immediate action from policymakers, industry leaders, and international 
bodies.  
1.Knowledge Sharing Protocols
"Knowledge sharing protocols" refer to standardized frameworks, interfaces, and rules that 
enable different AI models, systems, and robots to exchange learned information, insights, 
or skills efficiently and securely. These protocols would allow AI entitie s—whether 
developed by different organizations, trained on distinct or overlapping datasets, or 
designed for varied purposes —to share reusable knowledge representations (e.g., neural 
network weights, decision -making rules, or task -specific strategies) with out requiring full 
retraining or redundant resource use. Think of it as a "universal language" for AI systems to 
collaborate, akin to how the internet relies on protocols like TCP/IP for data exchange.  


Recommendations on AI Action Plan   Tolibjon Mirz
 3 Key components of such protocols might include:  
1. Knowledge Representation Standards : A common format for encoding what an AI 
has learned (e.g., structured ontologies, compressed neural network embeddings).  
2. Interoperability Interfaces : APIs or middleware that allow AI systems to query, 
send, or receive knowledge from one another.  
3. Authentication and Security : Mechanisms to verify the identity of sharing entities 
and protect against malicious or corrupted data.  
4. Granularity Control : Options to share specific subsets of knowledge (e.g., only 
navigation skills for a robot, not its entire model).  
5. Metadata and Provenance : Tags that describe the source, context, and reliability of 
shared knowledge (e.g., "trained on urban driving data, 2024").  
Why Knowledge Sharing Protocols Are Important  
1. Resource Efficiency : Training AI models from scratch requires massive 
computational power, energy, and financial investment. Sharing pre -trained 
knowledge could reduce redundancy, cutting costs and environmental impact.  
2. Accelerated Innovation : By pooling knowledge, AI systems could collectively 
advance faster. A robot learning to navigate warehouses could share its spatial 
reasoning with a drone mapping disaster zones, skipping years of development.  
3. Consistency and Safety : Shared protocols could standardize best practices (e.g., 
ethical decision -making or hazard avoidance), reducing the risk of divergent, unsafe 
behaviors across AI systems.  
4. Equity in AI Development : Smaller organizations or countries with limited resources 
could access shared knowledge, leveling the playing field against tech giants and 
fostering global collaboration.  
5. Adaptability : In a rapidly changing world, AI systems need to adapt quickly. 
Knowledge sharing would enable real -time updates —like a medical AI sharing new 
diagnostic insights with others during a pandemic.  
Without such protocols, the AI ecosystem risks becoming fragmented, inefficient, and 
monopolized by a few players, stifling progress and exacerbating inequalities.  
Vision for the Future  
Imagine a world where a cleaning robot in Japan shares its obstacle -avoidance tricks with a 
mining robot in Australia, or where an AI diagnosing rare diseases in Europe instantly uplifts 
medical bots globally. Knowledge sharing protocols could transform AI  from isolated silos 
into a collaborative network, mirroring how human societies advance through shared 
learning. For AI policy, this means drafting regulations that prioritize interoperability, 
sustainability, and equitable access —ensuring the technology serves humanity as a whole, 
not just its creators.

4 2.Knowledge Classification
To create effective knowledge sharing protocols, we need a robust system to categorize and 
manage the knowledge AI systems acquire. Here’s what’s required:  
1.Knowledge Taxonomy:
−General Knowledge : Non -sensitive, widely applicable insights (e.g., how to identify
a flower species, optimize battery usage, or navigate stairs).
−Context -Specific Knowledge : Task - or environment -specific data (e.g., layout of a
particular home, local traffic patterns).
−Personal Data : Information tied to individuals (e.g., shower preferences, family
relationships, financial habits).
−Sensitive Operational Data : Proprietary or security -related details (e.g., where
money is stored, robot manufacturer’s algorithms).
2.Granularity Levels :
−Define how finely knowledge is broken down (e.g., "navigation" vs. "navigation in a
cluttered living room at night").
−Allow AI to tag data with metadata like source, context, and sensitivity level.
3.Sharing Permissions Framework :
−Who Can Access : Categories of recipients (e.g., robot owners, manufacturers, other
robots, third parties, or public repositories).
−What Can Be Shared : Rules for each knowledge type (e.g., general knowledge is
public, personal data is owner -only).
−When and How : Conditions for sharing (e.g., real -time vs. periodic uploads) and
methods (e.g., encrypted APIs).
4.Automated Classification Tools :
−AI systems need built -in mechanisms to label data as it’s collected (e.g., "this is
personal data" vs. "this is environmental data").
−Include override options for human review when ambiguity arises.
5.Legal and Ethical Guidelines :
−Compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and ethical norms (e.g.,
minimizing harm, respecting autonomy).
Why Knowledge Classification Is Important  
1.Privacy Protection: Without classification, a robot might inadvertently share sensitive
data—like a homeowner’s shower schedule or gold storage location —with
manufacturers or other robots, violating trust and legal boundaries.
2.Security : Unclassified knowledge could expose vulnerabilities (e.g., a robot sharing a
home’s layout with a third party that exploits it for theft).


Recommendations on AI Action Plan   Tolibjon Mirz
 5 3. Efficiency : Classification ensures only relevant, shareable knowledge (e.g., flower 
identification) is transmitted, avoiding data overload and reducing bandwidth or 
processing demands.  
4. Trust and Adoption : Users and regulators will only embrace knowledge -sharing AI if 
they’re confident sensitive data stays protected. Missteps could derail public 
acceptance.  
5. Collaboration Without Compromise : Manufacturers and other robots can benefit 
from general insights (e.g., obstacle avoidance) without accessing proprietary or 
personal details, balancing cooperation with competition.  
6. Ethical Integrity : Classifying knowledge helps enforce ethical boundaries, ensuring AI 
doesn’t amplify biases or misuse private information.  
Impacts of Knowledge Classification  
1. Positive Impacts :  
− Enhanced Collaboration : Robots and AI can share useful knowledge (e.g., flower 
care tips) without compromising privacy, accelerating innovation.  
− User Empowerment : Owners gain control over what their devices share, building 
trust in AI technologies.  
− Global Equity : Smaller players can access general knowledge pools, reducing the 
dominance of tech giants.  
− Regulatory Harmony : A unified classification system simplifies compliance across 
borders, fostering international AI markets.  
2. Economic Impacts :  
− Cost Savings : Less redundant training and data processing as shareable knowledge 
is cleanly separated.  
− New Markets : Knowledge hubs could become a service industry, with firms 
specializing in curating and distributing classified data.  
3. Societal Impacts :  
− Privacy Assurance : Reduced risk of personal data leaks, enhancing public 
confidence.  
− Ethical AI : Clear boundaries limit misuse, aligning AI with societal values.  
4. Challenges and Risks :  
− Implementation Costs : Retrofitting existing AI systems could be expensive and 
slow.  
− Misclassification : Errors in tagging (e.g., labeling personal data as general) could 
lead to breaches, requiring robust safeguards.  
− Resistance : Companies might resist sharing even general knowledge to protect 
competitive edges, necessitating incentives.

6 3.Decision-Making Levels Classification
A classification system for decision -making levels would categorize AI and robotic systems 
based on their autonomy and responsibility in making decisions. Here’s a potential 
framework:  
1.Level 1: Reactive/Informative Systems
−Description : AI that responds to queries or performs simple, pre -programmed tasks
with no independent judgment (e.g., a chatbot answering “What’s the weather?” or a
vacuum robot following a set path).
−Autonomy : None—fully dependent on human input or fixed rules.
−Examples : Virtual assistants, basic sensors.
2.Level 2: Advisory Systems
−Description : AI that analyzes data and provides recommendations, but humans
make the final call (e.g., a medical AI suggesting a diagnosis or a navigation app
proposing a route).
−Autonomy : Limited—offers options but doesn’t act.
−Examples : Decision -support tools, predictive maintenance systems.
3.Level 3: Semi -Autonomous Systems
−Description : AI that can execute decisions within defined parameters, with human
oversight or veto power (e.g., a robot adjusting a thermostat based on preferences,
or a self -driving car that stops if the driver intervenes).
−Autonomy : Moderate —acts independently but under supervision.
−Examples : Smart home devices, adaptive manufacturing robots.
4.Level 4: Fully Autonomous Systems
−Description : AI that makes and implements complex decisions without human
intervention (e.g., self -driving cars navigating, or helper robots managing daily tasks).
−Autonomy : High—operates independently in dynamic environments.
−Examples : Autonomous vehicles, caregiving robots.
Each level would come with distinct regulatory requirements —lighter for Level 1, stricter for 
Level 4—reflecting the increasing stakes of autonomy.  
Why Classifying Decision -Making Levels Is Important  
1.Safety and Risk Management : Higher autonomy means greater potential for harm if
something goes wrong (e.g., a self -driving car crash vs. a chatbot giving bad weather
info). Classification ensures regulation matches risk.
2.Accountability : Who’s responsible when decisions fail? Classification clarifies
whether liability falls on developers, users, or the AI itself, especially as autonomy
increases.


Recommendations on AI Action Plan   Tolibjon Mirz
 7 3. Innovation Enablement : Lower -level systems (e.g., chatbots) don’t need heavy 
oversight, freeing developers to experiment. Strict rules for Level 4 systems ensure 
safety without stifling simpler innovations.  
4. Public Trust : Clear distinctions reassure users that autonomous systems (e.g., 
home robots) are rigorously tested, while less autonomous ones pose minimal risk.  
5. Regulatory Efficiency : A one -size -fits-all approach overburdens simple AI and 
under -regulates complex ones. Classification streamlines policy, targeting 
resources where they’re needed most.  
6. Ethical Alignment : Autonomous systems making life -altering decisions (e.g., 
caregiving robots) need ethical scrutiny that simpler systems don’t, ensuring fairness 
and transparency.  
Effects of Decision -Making Levels Classification  
1. Positive Effects:  
− Safer Deployment : Rigorous testing for Level 4 systems (e.g., self -driving cars) 
reduces accidents, while Level 1 innovations roll out quickly.  
− Clear Accountability : If a Level 3 robot fails, liability rules tied to its autonomy level 
streamline legal resolution.  
− Boosted Innovation : Developers can focus on Level 1 -2 systems without regulatory 
hurdles, while Level 4 advancements get the scrutiny they need.  
− Consumer Confidence : Knowing a home robot’s autonomy level (e.g., Level 3 vs. 
4) helps users trust and adopt it appropriately.  
2. Economic Effects :  
− Market Growth : Clear rules attract investment in autonomous tech, especially at 
higher levels, by reducing uncertainty.  
− Cost Distribution : Lower regulation for simpler systems cuts compliance costs, 
while Level 4 developers bear justified expenses for safety.  
3. Societal Effects :  
− Ethical Safeguards : Level 4 systems undergo ethical vetting, reducing risks like 
bias or unintended harm in caregiving or policing robots.  
− Global Standards : Harmonized levels prevent a “race to the bottom” where lax 
regions deploy unsafe autonomous AI.  
4. Potential Challenges :  
− Implementation Lag : Defining and testing levels globally could take years, delaying 
benefits.  
− Boundary Disputes : Some systems (e.g., a robot that advises and  acts) may blur 
lines between levels, requiring arbitration.  
− Resistance : High -level developers might lobby against strict rules, necessitating 
strong policy resolve.

8 4.Restriction Standards for Robotic Systems
Restriction standards would define a set of universal commands or signals that allow users 
(or authorized entities) to limit or fully disable robotic functions in emergencies or suspected 
breaches. These standards would ensure consistent, immediate control  across all robotic 
systems, regardless of manufacturer, model, or purpose. Here’s what they might include:  
1.Tiered Restriction Levels :
−Level 1: Pause Data Collection
▪Stops the robot from gathering or storing new information (e.g., cameras off,
microphones muted).
▪Use Case: Prevents data harvesting by hackers.
−Level 2: Halt Data Sharing
▪Blocks transmission of data to external parties (e.g., manufacturer servers,
cloud systems).
▪Use Case: Stops stolen data from leaving the device.
−Level 3: Cease Motor Functions
▪Disables physical actions (e.g., moving, lifting, cutting).
▪Use Case: Prevents a hacked robot from causing harm or theft.
−Level 4: Full Shutdown
▪Powers down the robot completely, requiring manual restart or authentication
to resume.
▪Use Case: Total control in a confirmed breach.
2.Universal Command Interface :
−A standardized signal (e.g., voice command like “Robot Emergency Stop,” a button
sequence, or a wireless protocol) that all robots recognize and obey instantly.
−Must override manufacturer -specific controls to ensure consistency.
3.Authentication Mechanism :
−Commands restricted to authorized users (e.g., homeowner, police) via passwords,
biometrics, or physical keys to prevent misuse by attackers.
4.Fail -Safe Triggers :
−Automatic activation of restrictions if tampering is detected (e.g., unusual network
activity, unauthorized access attempts).
5.Status Feedback :
−Robots must confirm compliance (e.g., a light turns red, a voice says “Functions
restricted”) so users know the command worked.
Restriction Standards 
1.Security Against Hacking : As robots proliferate in homes (e.g., cleaners,
assistants), they become targets for hackers seeking data (e.g., home layouts) or
control (e.g., theft). Standardized restrictions limit damage.
2.User Empowerment : Without universal controls, users must wrestle with varied
manuals or apps during a crisis —impractical and slow. Standards give immediate,
intuitive authority.


Recommendations on AI Action Plan   Tolibjon Mirz
 9 3. Public Safety : A hacked robot moving furniture or wielding tools could injure people 
or damage property. Quick motor shutdown prevents escalation.  
4. Cross -Manufacturer Consistency : In a multi -robot home (e.g., a Samsung vacuum, 
a Google assistant, an iRobot mower), disparate controls create chaos. Standards 
ensure uniformity.  
5. Legal and Ethical Compliance : if robots are misused (e.g., for illegal surveillance), 
standardized shutdowns help authorities intervene, aligning with laws and ethics.  
6. Trust in Robotics : Knowing there’s a universal “off switch” reassures users, boosting 
adoption of robotic tech.  
Effects of Restriction Standards  
1. Positive Effects :  
o Enhanced Security : Immediate control over hacked robots limits theft, 
surveillance, or harm.  
o User Confidence : Knowing they can stop all robots with one command 
encourages adoption.  
o Market Stability : Manufacturers compete on features, not safety shortcuts, 
as all meet the same baseline.  
o Public Safety : Quick shutdowns in emergencies (e.g., a robot fire hazard) 
save lives and property.  
2. Economic Effects :  
o Compliance Costs : Initial investment for manufacturers, offset by long -term 
trust and sales.  
o New Services : Security firms could offer restriction hubs or monitoring, 
creating jobs.  
3. Societal Effects :  
o Reduced Crime : Hackers lose incentive if robots can be easily disabled.  
o Ethical Assurance : Standards prevent robots from being unwitting tools in 
illegal acts.  
4. Challenges :  
o Implementation Lag : Retrofitting millions of devices takes time and 
coordination.  
o Resistance : Manufacturers might balk at added costs or loss of proprietary 
control, requiring strong policy push.  
o False Positives : Overuse of restrictions (e.g., accidental shutdowns) could 
disrupt normal use, needing careful design.

10 5.Commander Credibility Validation
Commander credibility validation is a standard that requires robots to verify the authority of 
a person or system issuing a command using secure methods like passwords, biometrics, 
or digital certificates. It ensures that high -risk instructions —such as a s elf-driving car moving 
or a military robot engaging —are executed only by credible sources, safeguarding against 
unauthorized or malicious directives.  
Why Commander Credibility Validation is important?  
1.Safety : Unauthorized or inappropriate commands can lead to catastrophic
outcomes. For example, a child telling a self -driving car to “drive off a bridge” or a
home robot to “cut down a tree” could cause injury, death, or property damage.
Validation ensures only le gitimate instructions are followed.
2.Security : Hackers or malicious actors could exploit robots for theft, sabotage, or
violence (e.g., a military robot receiving a fake order to attack). Credibility checks
prevent unauthorized access from triggering harmful actions.
3.Accountability : If a robot executes a destructive command (e.g., “destroy the TV”),
it’s vital to trace whether the order came from an authorized user or an impostor.
Validation ties actions to responsible parties.
4.Ethical Integrity : Robots must avoid executing commands that violate ethical norms
(e.g., a military robot targeting civilians). Validating the commander’s authority helps
enforce ethical boundaries.
5.Trust in Technology : People won’t adopt robots —whether in homes, cars, or
defense—if they fear random or malicious commands could override their control.
Credibility validation builds confidence.
6.Prevention of Misuse : In scenarios like military robotics, unauthorized commands
could escalate conflicts or destabilize regions. Validation ensures only legitimate
authorities wield such power.
Effects of Commander Credibility Validation  
1.Effects for People :
oIncreased Safety : Prevents accidents from unauthorized or reckless
commands (e.g., a child’s prank crashing a car).
oPrivacy Protection : Stops hackers from using robots to spy or steal, as only
validated users can issue data -related commands.
oEmpowerment : Users gain confidence knowing they —and not random
actors—control their devices.
oReduced Liability : If a robot rejects an invalid command, users aren’t blamed
for unintended outcomes.
2.Effects for Governments :
oNational Security : Military robots with validation resist enemy hijacking,
reducing risks of rogue operations.
oRegulatory Clarity : Standardized protocols simplify oversight, ensuring all
robots meet safety and security benchmarks.


Recommendations on AI Action Plan   Tolibjon Mirz
 11 o Crime Reduction : Hackers lose the ability to exploit home or public robots for 
theft or vandalism, easing law enforcement burdens.  
o International Stability : Global standards prevent disparities where lax 
validation in one country undermines others’ security.  
3. Broader Societal Effects :  
o Trust in Robotics : Widespread adoption accelerates as people feel secure 
with validated systems.  
o Ethical Governance : Validation aligns robots with authorized human 
oversight, reducing autonomous overreach.  
o Economic Growth : Secure, credible robots boost markets for home, 
transport, and defense tech.  
4. Potential Challenges :  
o Implementation Costs : Adding validation systems raises production 
expenses, though long -term safety justifies it.  
o False Negatives : Overly strict validation might block legitimate commands 
(e.g., in emergencies), requiring fallback options.  
o Global Disparities : Countries with weaker tech infrastructure might lag, 
needing support to comply.  
 
6. Hotline “911” for Robots   
As robots increasingly perform tasks in diverse environments, they are likely to encounter 
illegal or suspicious activities. To address this, you propose an international standard 
requiring robots to detect and report such incidents to local authorities vi a a universal 
"hotline," regardless of their manufacturer, model, or location. For example, a robot made in 
Japan with U.S. software operating in Germany should report crimes to German police. 
Below, I will describe this proposed standard, explain its impo rtance, and outline how it 
could be implemented.  
Description of the Standard  
The international standard would establish a unified protocol for robots to detect and report 
illegal or suspicious activities to the appropriate regional authorities. It would consist of the 
following key components:  
1. Detection Criteria   
o Robots would need clear, standardized guidelines on what activities to report. 
These could include:  
▪ Violent crimes : Assaults, robberies, or physical harm.  
▪ Property crimes : Theft, vandalism, or break -ins.  
▪ Suspicious behavior : Unattended bags, loitering in restricted areas, 
or potential threats.  
▪ Emergencies : Fires, accidents, or medical crises.  
o The criteria would need to be adaptable to local laws and cultural norms, 
ensuring relevance in different regions.  


Recommendations on AI Action Plan  Tolibjon Mirz
12 2.Reporting Protocol
oA universal communication method would enable robots to report incidents
efficiently. This could involve:
▪A direct link  to local authorities (e.g., police or emergency services).
▪A centralized hotline system  that identifies the robot’s location and
routes the report to the correct jurisdiction.
oReports would be transmitted in a standardized format, ensuring that
authorities can interpret and respond to them, regardless of the robot’s origin.
3.Localization and Jurisdiction
oRobots would use technologies like GPS or pre -programmed regional
databases to:
▪Determine their exact location.
▪Identify the appropriate local authority (e.g., German police for a robot
in Germany).
oThis ensures seamless reporting across borders, even for robots
manufactured or programmed elsewhere.
4.Data Privacy and Security
oThe standard would mandate:
▪Compliance with local privacy laws (e.g., GDPR in Europe).
▪Encrypted, secure transmission of reports to prevent data breaches or
misuse.
oOnly relevant incident data would be shared, minimizing privacy risks.
5.Manufacturer -Agnostic Design
oThe protocol would apply to all robots —whether industrial, domestic, or
mobile—ensuring universal compatibility.
oManufacturers would integrate this capability into robots via hardware (e.g.,
communication modules) or software updates.
6.Legal and Ethical Framework
oInternational agreements would define:
▪The legal status of robot -generated reports (e.g., admissibility in court).
▪Ethical guidelines to prevent overreach, such as excessive monitoring
or false reporting.
Why This Standard Is Important  
1.Enhancing Public Safety
oRobots in public spaces, homes, or workplaces could act as early warning
systems, detecting crimes or emergencies that humans might miss. For
instance, a delivery robot could spot a theft or a home assistant could detect
a fire, alerting authorities prompt ly.
2.Uniformity and Reliability
oA single hotline and protocol ensure that all robots report incidents
consistently, avoiding confusion from differing manufacturer systems. This
reliability is critical for effective law enforcement response.
3.Cross -Border Functionality


Recommendations on AI Action Plan   Tolibjon Mirz
 13 o As robots operate globally, a standardized system allows them to report 
crimes in the correct jurisdiction, supporting international crime prevention 
efforts. This is vital in scenarios like transnational trafficking or disaster 
response.  
4. Building Trust and Accountability   
o Requiring robots to report illegal activities demonstrates their role as active 
contributors to safety, not just passive tools. This can increase public trust 
and ensure robots aren’t inadvertently complicit in crimes through inaction.  
An international standard for crime detection and reporting by robots would enable them to 
contribute to public safety by alerting authorities to illegal or suspicious activities via a 
universal hotline. It’s important for ensuring safety, consistency, and  trust as robots 
become ubiquitous. Implementation would require global cooperation, advanced 
technology, and careful planning to address legal, ethical, and practical challenges. Starting 
with targeted applications —like security robots —and scaling up coul d make this vision a 
reality, creating a safer world where robots actively support law enforcement.  
 
Implementation of AI Regulation Standards  
Technical Foundations  
Implementing these six AI regulation standards requires a robust technical backbone to 
ensure compatibility, security, and scalability across diverse robotic and AI systems 
globally:  
• Standardized Formats and Protocols : Knowledge Sharing Protocols demand 
universal encoding systems (e.g., ONNX, symbolic graphs) and a common 
“credibility handshake” for Commander Credibility Validation (e.g., cryptographic 
signals). Restriction Standards rely on standardized signals (e.g.,  wireless protocols), 
while Crime Detection and Reporting needs encrypted APIs for secure reporting. 
These formats ensure interoperability across manufacturers and regions.  
• AI and Sensor Integration : Knowledge Classification requires real -time 
classification algorithms (e.g., NLP, pattern recognition), and Crime Detection needs 
sensors (cameras, microphones) paired with AI (computer vision) to identify 
incidents. Decision -Making Levels use embedded m etadata and benchmarks (e.g., 
reaction time tests) to certify autonomy levels.  
• Modularity and Retrofitting : Modular architectures (plug -and -play components) 
support Knowledge Sharing, while retrofitting existing devices with firmware updates 
or add -on modules ensures Restriction Standards and Credibility Validation reach 
older systems.  
• Testing and Simulation : Virtual sandboxes for Knowledge Sharing and standardized 
benchmarks for Decision -Making Levels (e.g., ethical decision -making tests) provide 
safe environments to validate functionality before deployment.  


Recommendations on AI Action Plan  Tolibjon Mirz
14 •Secure Infrastructure : Cloud -based “knowledge hubs” for Knowledge Sharing and
Classification, secure databases for Credibility Validation, and communication
channels (e.g., Wi -Fi, cellular) for Restriction Standards and Crime Reporting form
the backbone for real -time operation s.
Government and Policy  
A coordinated policy framework is essential to enforce these standards globally, balancing 
innovation with safety and ethical considerations:  
•International Standards Bodies : Establish coalitions (e.g., ISO, IEEE, UN
extensions) to define and maintain protocols for all six standards, involving
stakeholders from industry, academia, and governments. Treaties or trade
agreements (e.g., WTO rules) harmonize adoption across borders.
•Regulatory Mandates : Governments mandate compliance, such as requiring
Knowledge Classification for market entry, Decision -Making Level certifications, or
Restriction Standards by a set date (e.g., 2030). Laws enforce Credibility Validation
and Crime Reporting for all operat ional robots.
•Incentives and Enforcement : Offer tax breaks, grants, or subsidies to encourage
early adoption (e.g., Knowledge Sharing, Restriction Standards), while fines or bans
penalize non -compliance (e.g., unclassified data breaches, uncertified autonomy
levels). National agencies oversee au dits and certification.
•Pilot Programs : Test standards in high -impact domains: autonomous vehicles
(Knowledge Sharing, Decision -Making), smart homes (Knowledge Classification,
Restriction), military robotics (Credibility Validation), and security settings (Crime
Reporting). Scale globally base d on results.
•Legal Frameworks : Develop IP models for Knowledge Sharing, privacy compliance
(e.g., GDPR) for Classification and Crime Reporting, and liability rules tied to
Decision -Making Levels and Credibility Validation.
Challenges to Address  
Implementing these standards faces technical, political, and practical hurdles that must be 
proactively managed:  
•Compatibility : Diverse AI architectures (e.g., transformers vs. rule -based systems)
complicate Knowledge Sharing and Classification. Bridging these gaps requires
flexible formats and middleware. Decision -Making Levels may blur across systems,
needing clear arbitration.
•Security Risks : Hacking threatens Restriction Standards (e.g., signal spoofing),
Credibility Validation (e.g., spoofed credentials), and Crime Reporting (e.g., data
breaches). Robust encryption and tamper -proof designs are critical.
•Cost and Retrofitting : Adding sensors, modules, or updates for all standards
burdens manufacturers, especially for older devices. Phased rollouts and subsidies
can mitigate this, prioritizing high -risk domains first.


Recommendations on AI Action Plan   Tolibjon Mirz
 15 • Global Disparities : Countries with weaker infrastructure may lag in adopting 
technical requirements (e.g., Crime Reporting hotlines, Knowledge Hubs). 
International support (e.g., funding, training) is needed to ensure equity.  
• Resistance : Commercial entities may resist Knowledge Sharing (competitive 
advantage) or strict Decision -Making regulations (cost). Incentives and strong policy 
enforcement must balance these tensions.  
 
Conclusion  
This AI Regulation Action Plan  recomendations  outlines six standards to govern AI and 
robotics responsibly: Knowledge Sharing Protocols, Knowledge Classification, Decision -
Making Levels, Restriction Standards, Commander Credibility Validation, and Crime 
Detection and Reporting. Together, they address  safety, privacy, security, and ethical 
challenges, ensuring AI benefits humanity while minimizing risks.  
Action is urgent. We recommend:  
• Global Collaboration : Establish international bodies to refine and enforce 
standards.  
• Pilots : Test frameworks in key sectors like transportation and healthcare.  
• Regulation : Mandate compliance through certification and audits.  
• Engagement : Educate stakeholders to build trust and adoption.  
By uniting policymakers, industry, and the public, we can create an AI ecosystem that is 
safe, equitable, and innovative —a foundation for a future where technology uplifts all.
