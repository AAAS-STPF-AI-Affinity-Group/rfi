General Comment
I guess attorneys would to prefer to handle the inevitable lawsuits that arise from  this but I have to tell you this is a terrible rule that will kill
profitability and won't m ake shareholders happy as AI com panies violate our copyrights (and their investm ents) ad infinitum  with no
com pensation. Anyone arguing for this doesn't understand business at all.
