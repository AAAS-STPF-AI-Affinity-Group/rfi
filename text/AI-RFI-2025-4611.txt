General Comment
As has been dem onstrated tim e and tim e again, generative AI is a heavy m oney-sink technology that has had little to no beneficial im pacts,
with the heavy energy cost just to operate it vastly disproportionate to the so-called quality of whatever it even outputs. Its m ost prom inent
users like OpenAI have adm itted they've needed to scrape other peoples' work without any form  of com pensation in order to stock up on
data, and this action plan does nothing to address that - rather, it only serves to em bolden them  to do it m ore at the expense of every
single Am erican creative, big and sm all. Once again, along with m uch of this adm inistration's orders, it only abandons the people it claim s
to benefit.
And beyond that, it has only been a few years since it really "took off" as a fad, and already in the eyes of m ost Am ericans generative AI's
usage has becom e synonym ous with laziness, uncreativeness, thievery and wastefulness. For m uch of the general public it is a weight that
drags down every production and program  that uses it. Allowing this kind of system  to roam  unchecked with this kind of plan will only
serve to harm  Am erica's im age in the technology space rather than enhance it.
