Generative AI and LLMs are environmentally destructive that cannot exist without infringing
on the copyrights of thousands and thousands of individual creatives across a plethora ofdisciplines. For this reason alone, AI should have no place in a better future for the U.S. As afreelance illustrator who works closely with creatives from adjacent industries, such asanimation and the music industry, I've already seen firsthand the way AI worsens workflow,production, efficiency, and final products, and yet continues to replace actual skilled laborerssuch as myself because higher-ups who do not have a strong understanding of how their actualproduct is made have bought into the false and easily disproven claims Silicon Valley makesabout the future of AI.
