General Comment
AI is not m agical and does not m iraculously fix everything.
AI is a way of processing hum an knowledge and skill. That process is neither inherently accurate nor inherently beneficial. Som e exam ples
of the failures of AI are hallucinations and revenge porn.
Specifically, the governm ent needs to develop protections for copyrighted m aterials that m ight be exploited for profit without benefiting the
creator or holder of the copyright. We have already seen over and over again AI program s used to harvest artists' work without consent.
The m aterial generated from  that AI also needs scrutiny. Deep fakes, harm ful advice, and scam s created through AI are already here. The
problem  will only get worse as the technology becom es m ore prevalent.
Industrialization brought about cheaper and better goods, but it also generated trem endous am ounts of pollution. There was so m uch
pollution that rivers regularly caught on fire by the 1970s. I fear sim ilar large system ic problem s will occur without som e circum spection on
AI.
