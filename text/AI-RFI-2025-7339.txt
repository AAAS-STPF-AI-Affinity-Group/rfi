Re: N ational S cience F oundation’ s Request fo r Information on t he D e velopment o f an A rtificial 
Intelligence (AI) A ction Plan 
I am an e veryday A merican w ho o wns a sm all visual design b usiness w hich s erves c lients in t he 
entertainment in dustry. I h ave worked h ard f or years to d evelop t he skills an d knowledge t o build my 
business, a nd h ave b een l ucky enough t o make a d ecent l iving and s upport my f amily – until r ecently. 
The AI s ystems m a de by B ig Tec h companies l ike OpenAI (Microsoft) a nd G oogle th reaten t o destroy 
thousands of American small businesses li ke mine w ith their recent d emand to c reate spec ial carve outs 
in copyright law . 
AI systems c an only b e produced b y first t rainin g on w ork made by p eople. My u nique w ork, and the 
work o f hundreds o f thousands o f other e veryday A merican c reators w as taken a nd fed into these A I 
systems wi thou t our c onsent or a ny compensation. Th ey inges t our w ork, r eassemble it, a nd th en sell it 
back t o our clients – directly c ompeting wi th us and c utting u s out of th e marketplace. 
Now these Big T ech c ompanies are a sking t his ad ministration to c reate exceptions an d loopholes t o 
make t his p ractice o f stealing A merican c reators’ c opyrighted w ork l egal precedent. T hey are suggesting 
that if a machine in gests an d reproduces c opyrighted work, it i s somehow s uddenly “ fair u se”.  
They s eem to b eliev e tha t anything a nd ev erything o n the intern et – regardless of who o wns it – should 
be theirs f or the taking. T hey c laim that if t his ad ministration d oes n ot allo w them t o rewrite t he law in 
this w ay, it w ill stifle A merican in novation. 


Instead, it will have the opposite effect. The purpose of American copyright law is to protect the 
incentive to create and innovate.  
If we the American people do not own our creations, and everything we put online will be stolen by Big 
Tech giants, what will be the incentive to create? If everyday Americans create a new innovative piece of 
computer code, a new visual design, or a new piece of music only to have it immediately stolen by Google and Microsoft, why bother creating it in the first place? How will we possibly make a living doing 
these things?  
Want  to protect American innovation? Protect American creators. Do not create new copyright 
exemptions that allow Big Tech companies to exploit and steal from creators and everyday Americans 
without permission, compensation, or transparency.  
This administration’s AI Action Plan should focus not on giving away creator content to Big Tech 
companies, but rather on ensuring a fair marketplace with competition:  
First, the government should ensure that creators and everyday Americans give effective consent, so 
that we can decide when and where our work is used by AI systems.  
Second, the AI Action Plan should encourage a robust licensing marketplace, so that the incentive to 
create for small businesses is preserved. Our work has immense economic value, so the value generated by that work should accrue to the original creators, not just Big Tech.  
Finally , the AI Action Plan should require transparency from Big Tech companies, requiring them to 
disclose what material is in their training datasets, and label what content is AI generated.  
I am  not anti -technology or anti -AI. I am consistently impressed by the capabilities of these AI systems, 
and find them incredibly useful for many things. But we should not sacrifice the hard work of hundreds of thousands of Americans and give it away to Big Tech by rewriting copyright law.  


Thank you for the opportunity to comment on these important issues.
