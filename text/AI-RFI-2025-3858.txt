General Comment
We should not allow AI to scrap/steal anyone's data! Period! All it does it regurgitate inform ation and jum ble things up, leaving it
unreliable and create disinform ation. Not to m ention that m ore often than not, they steal from  other people's work that they did not
consent to. This is both dangerous and unnecessary. AI can be useful of given tim e, but we need sustainable power and regulations.
Pushing a new tech that has proven tim e and tim e again to be unreliable will not solve anything.
