General Comment
AI developm ent only occurs with theft of intellectual property. Full stop. AI developers should have to pay for every single thing they
access whether a published book, a personal blog post, or recordings of voices from  your sm artphone. If AI developers can not cannot
pay for these things, or write them  independently them selves, they should stop developm ent. There is no other argum ent to be m ade.
Either AI learning from  others m aterial is theft or NOTHING is theft.
