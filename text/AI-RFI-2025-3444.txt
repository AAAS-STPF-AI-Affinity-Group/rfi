General Comment
AI is a bubble and allowing the likes of OpenAI to train on copyrighted works, without com pensation, is unethical but also worthless in
the longer term . "But China-" it isn't any less of a bubble for them  either. Overhyped, overexaggerated, expensive and unwanted. Invest in
som ething actually worth developing and keep copyright protections for those that need and deserve it
