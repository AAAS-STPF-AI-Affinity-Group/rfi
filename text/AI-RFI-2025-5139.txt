General Comment
As an artist and anim ator working in the anim ation industry, AI has proven tim e and tim e again that its only function is to take the hard
work that artists dedicate their tim e for and recreate it into a bastardized, unoriginal version of it without their consent. 
As an Am erican citizen, I strongly oppose the Developm ent of an AI Action Plan to let AI com panies steal and generate m ore "art" and
personal inform ation.
