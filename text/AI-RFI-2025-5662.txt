General Comment
As an independent artist whose livelihood is dependent on m y decades of experience and practice, AI is a threat to m yself and all other
Am ericans who cannot com pete with a cold, unthinking network of m achines that take our work without our consent and use it to
generate profit as a m ockery of our labor.
Am ericans deserve better than generative AI. It is a speculative bubble that provides little benefit to the average Am erican taxpayer. It is
an existential threat not just to creatives, but to us all.
