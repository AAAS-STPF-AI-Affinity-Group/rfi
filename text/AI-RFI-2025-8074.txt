General Comment
You're not going to listen to me anyway, but you can sti ll stuff this whole "ai" &^% back where it cam e from.
This rece nt obsess ion with some machine process t hat the marketing teams have dec ided to ca ll ‚Äùai" has do ne nothing but harm peop le in 
this country and abroad. It s hould not be incorporated into systems of government as it will bring more destr uction to t he institutions we 
depend on a nd directly harm humans everywhere.
