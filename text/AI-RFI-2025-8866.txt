General Comment
This is by far the dum best, m ost idiotic, and unethical idea I have ever heard! 
AI is getting on m y last nerve, along with the incom petence it brings.
Many of us have jobs who are artists and anim ators who have worked tirelessly our entire lives to m aking a career out of doing what we
love; Only for AI to com e in and take it all away from  us for the sake of m aking a quick buck. 
AI is doing nothing to benefit us, in fact its doing the opposite effect!
Lives are being destroyed, jobs are on the line, and repusling so m any people away from  it for how horrendous AI is becom ing, and I
know for a fact I'm  not the only one who thinks that.
Please for the sake of all of us, dism antle AI, get rid of it, I DO NOT CARE!!! As long as AI can stop interfering with m y life as well as
everyone else who is sick and tired of it, ONCE AND FOR ALL.
