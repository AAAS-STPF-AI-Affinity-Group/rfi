As the title states, AI is primarily theft when used by companies like OpenAI and ChatGPT.
They do not care about copyright nor anything of that nature. I am pretty sure if this goesahead, there will be backlash from some of the larger companies in the US as well. Imaginepeople using this to train their models on Disney or DC Publishing, grabbing Marvel, Star Warsand DC Heroes for their AI models, and neither of those companies can say anything becausethis AI Action Plan says "Copyright doesn't count for AI".
This will make it open season on all forms of creativity in order to further very small groups to
make money, while destroying smaller ecosystems of creatives. As such, I am vehementlyagainst this going forward. "AI", or LLMs have no purpose in creative sectors other than toattempt to try and eliminate human creativity for profit. They do have a reason to exist inScientific Ventures, but they do not need an 'AI Action Plan' for scientific research as there isalready safeguards in place for it.
