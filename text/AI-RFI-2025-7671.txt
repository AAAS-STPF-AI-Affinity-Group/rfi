General Comment
As the author of half a dozen novels and a technology journalist and com m entator of alm ost two decades, I have grave concerns about
allowing AI unfettered and unchallenged access to copyrighted m aterials. This would rem ove a fundam ental protection of creative
professionals in the US, and opens the door to hurt Am erican workers in these fields. If the answer is that it is what China does, is that
really the exam ple we want to em ulate? Itâ€™s a short-sighted decision that underm ines what is really valuable: hum an created works of art.
Ultim ately it only benefits those who sit at the top of these com panies by rem oving restrictions that are in place for well-founded reasons.
Am erican ingenuity should be able to develop these technologies without sacrificing the very thing they are supposedly in service to, the
citizens of this country.
