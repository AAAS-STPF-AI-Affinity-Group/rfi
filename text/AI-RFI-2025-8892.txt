General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is not a technology that we should be investing and developing. It is an innactuate, copyright infringing, plagiarism
spewing cesspool of code that requires vast am ounts of power and water to fuel.
AI has been foisted upon us by the m orally, and creatively bankrupt who only see it as a m eans to elim inate the hum an elem ent.
People do not want this. Artist, writers, anim ators, voice actors, acting guilds, and m any others have protested the use of this kind of
technology as a threat to not only their livelyhoods, but to art itself.
And yet it is being pushed by tech giants, and others who see this as an opportunity to "save m oney".
Yet the average person bewails having to opt out of their data being collected for AI. Having to opt out of AI features in their phones,
com puters, and software.
Protect the Am erican People's Privacy. Protect us from  buying the scam  that is AI.
