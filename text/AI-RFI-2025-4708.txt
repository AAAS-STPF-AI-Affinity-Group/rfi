General Comment
As an artist and an author, I deserve to be paid for m y copyrighted work just as I pay others for their contributions to it. This is already a
m achine that is running well where people pay us and we pay others. To throw our hard work into a churning plagiarism  m achine without
com pensation to be regurgitated in bits and pieces of AI work is wrong. 
For decades, authors and artists have had recourse, which has been established by laws and courts, to be com pensated. This is a system
built by the people for the people. AI is built upon the people, illegally using copyrighted works of people, designed to cut out people.
Additionally, it will open up staggering am ounts of lawsuits as snippets of copyrighted works appear in AI plagiarized fabrications. This
has already proven to be happening. (See articles on the Om egaverse appearing in AI fabrications.)
If AI cannot exist legally and ethically, without dam aging lives, the environm ent, and livelihoods, we are not ready for this, and should not
be funding AI as a nation. I'm  a citizen of this nation, and I should be able to have a say in whether I want to toss everything I've m ade into
a m achine to be churned out as plagiarized jum bles of m ediocrity.
