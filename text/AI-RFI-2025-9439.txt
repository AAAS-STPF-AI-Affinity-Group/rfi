General Comment
Granting OpenAI this level of protection is utterly against the principles of capitalism . Not only does it destroy copyright protections that
m illions of jobs rely upon, but it would grant a m assive advantage to one com pany without appropriate consideration.
Furtherm ore, there is no evidence that LLMs can significantly exceed their current abilities with m ore inform ation, and even if they could,
the am ount of inform ation in the world is finite: it would plateau again, and with no way to further im prove. Unlike the hum an m ind, LLMs
cannot create, only reproduce what they've seen before. Hum an labor is ultim ately less expensive and far m ore environm entally friendly.
