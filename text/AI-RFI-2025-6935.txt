General Comment
Many of m y personal friends and fam ily are artists whose livelihood is either m ade or partially supported by their work as an artist. They
deserve the right to have their works be protected against AI theft, and that's exactly what generative AI is, unless the artist gives their
direct consent to be used to train AI.
