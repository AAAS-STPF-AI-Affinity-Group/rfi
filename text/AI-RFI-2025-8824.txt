General Comment
The idea that generative AI is som ehow im portant or relevant to the United States is a com plete and utter sham . There is no m erit to
researching this technology, and in the m eantim e it will only harm  m any thousands of people who will have their work stolen without
com pensation. I do not believe AI has any place in the US, and I strongly oppose any policy that encourages its developm ent.
