General Comment
I think itâ€™s ridiculous to allow AI com panies to seize the work of others for their own financial gain. This country is about freedom .
Freedom  to create. Creativity is the backbone of this country and AI com panies have none. They need to steal the creative work of
others in order to train their m odels. If their success REQUIRES stealing the work of others, then it sure sounds like they are horrible at
what they do.
