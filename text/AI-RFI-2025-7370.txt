General Comment
AI is not to be given a place in the future of the United States of Am erica with free-reign over copyrighted m aterial or any related acts. It
should not be given free agency to steal from  the livelihood of Am ericans and their craft in any capacity. AI is com pletely and utterly
rubbish, deserving no special action or care in letting it take over in such a way. Any decent Am erican, or heck, any decent PERSON
should realize this, let alone com panies. If you desire m arketable or otherwise usable research or craft and m aterials, including art, design,
m usic, etc..., you will not throw it away by doing anything to enable AI further, and INSTEAD invest in PEOPLE and their ability on their
own.
