General Comment
Allowing for AI to go unregulated takes away the likenesses of m any individuals and m ay cause an industry collapse for those who create
in the art field. Things like m usic, painting voice acting, m any beginner entry jobs and positions would be also taken from  people which
would affect the job m arket as a whole. Copyright is im portant as it protects creations and patents from  all creators from  Disney to even
inventions and allowing that to dissolve would m ean individuals can copy anything and everything without any sort of repercussions and no
one would be able to protect their individualities and their identities. Regulations need to be m ade to protect people’s likenesses and to
provide a fairer use of AI, people should be paid if their likenesses are used or if their copyrighted works are placed into AI system s.
Make AI fair so everyone can enjoy it without harm ing those who have created for years who put their heart and soul into each and every
piece they create and so people are no longer replaced by a m arket looking for m ore advanced or easy way users without allowing for
entry level jobs, because eventually those advanced individuals will need to retire and then there will be no one to replace them  and if an
AI can just m ake ‘code’ then the argum ent of ‘ just learn to code’ falls flat when those individuals becom e replaced anyways.
