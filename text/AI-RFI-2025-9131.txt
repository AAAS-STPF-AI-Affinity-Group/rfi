General Comment
Existing copyright law is not an 'unnecessary burdensom e requirem ent'. It is the legal fram ework which allows creators to protect their
work products and be com pensated for the use of their work products. Com panies producing generative AI should be required to follow
existing copyright law. If this prevents them  from  being profitable, they need a better business m odel, not a special carve-out to m ake
them  im m une from  the law. The value and benefit of their work has not yet been proven and there is no reason to give them  an advantage
in the m arketplace by letting them  ignore laws that restrain others.
