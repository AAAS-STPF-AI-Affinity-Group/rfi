General Comment
Large Language Models and other products m arketed as “AI” should not be allowed to circum vent copyright law, which is one of the
foundational underpinnings of our capitalist system . If no one’s com m ercial rights to their own output are respected, innovation will slow
and then cease, and we will find our country further and further behind the world until we are no longer able to keep up. The Am erican we
know today will becom e an unrecognizable shadow of its form er, world-leading glory.
