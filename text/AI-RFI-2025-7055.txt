General Comment
AI is overhyped and not intelligent. It is m achine learning. AI gobbles up peopleâ€™s work and creations to enrich a very few. AI steals our
livelihoods as citizens and profits off of theft of the intellectual property of all we regular citizens. It should be highly regulated and the theft
m ust stop.
