General Comment
Generative "AI" is a garbage technology with no functional use case t hat turns energy and water into lies. The plan for AI in government is 
that it shou ld not be implem ented in any way and shou ld instead be reg ulated out of ex istence due to its sole rel iance on stolen 
materials,  its incapabi lity to not make up &^% and its outsi zed en vironmental impact.
