General Comment
The world needs to be extrem ely careful with AI. Our only plan should be to keep it's usage tightly lim ited and regulated until we
understand just how m uch dam age and chaos it can cause, not just letting anyone run wild with it and swallowing up our nation's resources
in the process. We are playing with fire in a dry old forest and we don't even know it. Contain it before it becom es im possible to control.
