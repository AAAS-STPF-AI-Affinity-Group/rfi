General Comment
Stealing from  sm all business to line Sam  Altm an's pockets will not secure Am erica's future. This is irresponsible, carving out exceptions for
robber-barons because their product cannot com pete. 
DeepSeek will not be overcom e by protecting Sam  Altm an. This will only accelerate Am erica's decline, & cause untold econom ic harm .
