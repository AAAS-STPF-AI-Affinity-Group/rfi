General Comment
Generative AI technologies rely on m aking the statistically m ost average output based on data gathered without any consideration for the
data's owners or hosts. The idea that this technology can lead to innovation or a stronger nation is ludicrous, as the m ost statistically
average output is always SEO slop that adds little to no value to any application. Hum an brains have already m ade the value of data a
race to the bottom  as it seeks to extract value out of the least am ount of effort possible.
A strong nation and econom y needs to rely on true innovation and statistically unlikely ideas to get ahead. Building further AI technology
will just accelerate the race to the bottom  to autom ate good business, ideas, and innovation out of our lives.
