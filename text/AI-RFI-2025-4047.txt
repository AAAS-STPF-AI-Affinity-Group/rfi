General Comment
It has already been proven that AI com panies have outright stolen copyrighted m aterials from  corporations and creatives alike. Stop the
theft of legally owned and protected creative m aterials from  additional theft for the sake of im perfect technology that has never m et even
the m inim um  of its proposed goals. 
Do NOT allow theft to be the bedrock of these com panies that have already wasted billions and caused even m ore environm ental dam age
than any hum ans could do
