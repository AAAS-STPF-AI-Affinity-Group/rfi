The American government should be more concerned with maintaining individual privacy and
copyright protection than chasing trends on expensive and impractical chatbots.
Every cent spent on AI that may hypothetically benefit the American people and bolstering the
economy is money not spent on projects with known results; it is a pointless risk for nobenefit.
If this agency truly cared about the American people and not their own personal investments,
they would abandon the AI bubble and invest in businesses and infrastructure with existingmaterial benefits. The value of an egg farm is known, the value of a server farm is unknown.
