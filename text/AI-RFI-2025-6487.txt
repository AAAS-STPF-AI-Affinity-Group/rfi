General Comment
AI can only produce a soulless regurgitation of stolen work from  real artists, writers, and hum an creativity. It's going to drive people away
from  the places that utilize it. It doesn't m ake things better. People hate it and already don't trust it. The dam age has been done but there's
no reason to m ake it any worse by giving it unchecked power. Eventually it will have nothing new to consum e and the internet will be a
wasteland of AI cannibilizing itself.
