General Comment
Generative Artificial Intelligence hasn't m ade a believable case to it's existence, let alone as som ething that should be considered a
worthwhile investm ent.
Allowing m odels like OpenAI to continue to receive funding and unregulated access to "training" data only serves to devalue the work of
existing Am erican skills to the benefit of no one.
