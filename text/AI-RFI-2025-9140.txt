General Comment
AI m odels are trained extensively using copyrighted m aterial, which is stolen and used to produce derivative work.
The governm ent should NOT be m aking carve-outs to existing copyright law at the behest of a handful of venture capital-funded tech
startups. The only benefit of AI is to em ployers and executives, who will use it to cut "redundancies" by displacing hum an workers, further
com pounding an already growing unem ploym ent issue.
If AI is to be trained on copyrighted work, they m ust be legally com pelled to license that work, just like m usicians m ust license song rights
to perform  covers. 
Surely OpenAI has received enough funding to be able to facilitate such a licensing schem e. If not, they should be left to collapse under
the weight of the m arket.
