General Comment
The Am erican public does not want AI. AI is stealing the data of m illions of Am ericans without their consent. It is stealing jobs from  the
com m on m an which you so desperately want to defend. It is creating a generation of lazy people who cannot think for them selves, spitting
in the face of hard working Am ericans who have created the work/data being stolen to train AI training m odels.
