General Comment
I am  a Software Engineer in California. Working in the tech sector I offer work with AI tooling often. 
Due to its prevalence in search I have to look deeper for sources on everything because every once in a while generative AI will return
falsehoods. This erodes trust m y trust in things generated by it. 
Additionally generative AI tooling is rem oving opportunities from  junior developers who need tim e in the industry to learn the trade. While
we won't see the effects im m ediately this could cause a decline in future experienced Software Engineers that these generative AIs can not
replace.
While there is a place for generative AI tooling it should be handled with m ore care from  sourcing it's data m odels training data in ethical
ways (training the m odels on data that was given with enthusiastic consent) adding in protections for folks who m ay be displaced by this
technology and keeping a bit of a hum an elem ent in things we do. Generative AI is supposed to take away the tedious part of life and not
replace hum an creativity.
