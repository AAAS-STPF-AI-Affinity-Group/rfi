General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is an apparatus of surveillance. It treats all people's data - personal, private, intellectually owned, or otherwise - as
nothing m ore than num bers to be used to profit a select num ber of com panies. It will be used to create despair for the Am erican worker.
Its use should be heavily regulated to ensure that our jobs, lives, and privacy are protected. AI should not be allowed to take away from
us, because a m achine cannot be held responsible for its actions.
