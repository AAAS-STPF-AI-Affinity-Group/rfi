General Comment
While I can understand artificial intelligence's value in the advancem ent of m edicine, I believe that generative AI-- the kind that ram pantly
steals from  copyrighted m aterial in order to regurgitate soulless pieces of so-called "art"-- is a blight on hum anity. It's resource intensive
and seeks to consolidate wealth into the hands of the few at the expense of the m any. Illustrators, writers, m ovie m akers, voice actors,
and m ore are all being told that their skills aren't worth being paid for. But at the sam e tim e, legislation like this em powers thieves to
reproduce their hard work without input, without credit, paym ent, or respect. It's a lie used to justify exploitation.
If generative artificial intelligence can't exist without theft, then it doesn't have a place in this world. The dem and for this technology is
overinflated by the snake oil salesm an desperate to line their pockets. 
Generative AI is a bubble that is doom ed to burst. Don't give into the grift. This kind of decision can only lead to a surge of unem ploym ent
and needless suffering while opening the gates to a flood of garbage.
One of the US's greatest exports is our entertainm ent industry. If generative AI is allowed to train on copyrighted m aterial, then there will
be nothing stopping the industry from  being driven straight into the garbage with cheap junk. People will learn the difference when they are
tired with junk. They will look elsewhere. This isn't an investm ent in Am erica's future; it's a death sentence.
