General Comment
As a creative Am erican whose livelihood depends on m y work, allowing AI com panies to train on copyrighted m aterial is a direct threat
to m y way of life. How am  I supposed to m ake a living off of m y writing, artwork, or video production skills I have spent years honing if
m y work can just be stolen and fed into a m achine that produces copies of m y intellectual property? AI generated art and text is already
taking jobs away from  hardworking creative Am ericans and further sanitizing our culture with hollow im itations of hum an expression.
Allowing OpenAI to freely train on copyrighted m aterials would only accelerate the decline of our distinct Am erican culture and push us
towards a future of hom ogenized slop. Thank you for listening.
