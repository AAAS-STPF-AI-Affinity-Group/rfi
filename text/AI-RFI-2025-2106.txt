General Comment
A.I. is not som ething that is beneficial to anyone other than the people stealing the art to m ake these prom pts. It also has a m assive toll on
the environm ent, but the m ost heinous thing is that it takes jobs away from  hard working creatives that honed their crafts for their entire life
so that a few wealthy uncreative tech m oguls can bolster their bank accounts.
