General Comment
This is preposterous. This is a labor issue. The tech com panies are asking to be allowed to steal legally from  workers in all creative fields.
Think of all the m oney that m ovies, TV, video gam es, books, and m ore generate for the US econom y, and the tech industry wants to
cripple that workforce for a quick buck on a subpar product with the bottom  falling out within the next few years anyway, inevitably taking
a m assive chunk of our econom y and our creative industries with it. If the tech industry is not capable of creating a cost-effective product
without cannibalizing the econom y then they've already failed and should not be rewarded for it.
