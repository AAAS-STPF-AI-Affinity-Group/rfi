General Comment
OpenAI and Google are both underm ining the free people of the United States of Am erica by desiring for the Federal Governm ent to
abolish laws that protect intellectual property designed and developed by individuals and com panies as creative com m ons or open license
ideas or property despite there being no written consent for this by the owner of the IP. Essentially, we are reverting to a tim e when the
people who founded this country did not desire to have their ideas, thoughts, or property stolen, destroyed, or legally censored by a
governm ent that did not believe in free thought or ownership outside of the state. If Open AI or any other GenAI com pany or organization
were able to take a com pany or individual's IP for any reason other than consent, contractual licensing, or legal action then they would be
outright stealing property, which is a crim inal offense according to the constitution. Please, for freedom  of individuals & com panies and to
uphold the constitution's protection of intellectual property from  the state, other com panies, or individuals refrain from  allowing GenAI
organizations from  abolishing or working around the federal copyright law.
