General Comment
Any AI Action Plan the NSF develops m ust say that com panies cannot use works m ade by other people or entities to train their m odels
without explicit opt-in perm ission. I am  a full-tim e editor and a hobbyist writer - I need to feel secure that the books and whatever else I
work on will not be essentially stolen and analyzed by any random  com pany's AI m odel without perm ission and com pensation. Som e
authors and artists m ight allow their works to be included in these m odels and others won't.
