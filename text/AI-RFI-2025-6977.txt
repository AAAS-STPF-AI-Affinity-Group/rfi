General Comment
I am  not an artist, or author. I am  a user, albeit reluctantly, of products presently referred to as "AI."
I think that any policy to foster language and im age m odels should be crafted with great and deliberate care. Recklessness around
copyright or tradem ark, or indeed any generous license to use "training data" without proper consent and provenance, could result in
products that are deeply insecure and are banned in other countries.
The United States m ay find itself so eager to give US technology com panies free license to do as they will that the country will effectively
elim inate any export potential, thereby ceding the global m arket to m ore acceptable products.
Between this and the fostered disregard for privileged inform ation, com panies will be less inclined to use such insecure and un-exportable
program s.
This is to say nothing of the chilling effect on the creativity and innovation of the Am erican spirit. Am erican creators, authors, and
innovators will feel less free to share their creations, for fear of som eone else m onetizing their hard work and dedicated effort. Intellectual
property is a bedrock of Am erican innovation, and shouldn't be sacrificed in a panic induced by industry insiders.
It is the role of governm ent som etim es to dam pen the zeal of com panies that m ay do them selves harm  in their urgency to com pete, the
better to sustain a long term  healthy com petition that lifts all.
