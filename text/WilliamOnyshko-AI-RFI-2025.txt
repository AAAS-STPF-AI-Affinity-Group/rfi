William Onyshko , 
My name is W illiam Onyshko, I am a 2nd semester senior in high school at Avonworth High 
School in P ittsburgh, PA. I am currently enrolled in two new classes "Human Flourishing" 
and "AI and Ethics" . I studied generative AI and its impact on the accounting c ommunity for 
two months in this course. From my research, I think this current administration's 
viewpoint on AI regulation is to be used as a tool. AI has a very high chance of taking this 
job type, but we should not eliminate jobs. So I applaud your campaign for not wanting to do so but would like to see it as a tool and not a crutch even implemented more into schools. As we have a class on it as this could be the future of the world.
