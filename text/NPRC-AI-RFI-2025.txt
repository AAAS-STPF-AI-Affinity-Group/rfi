1 National Payroll Reporting Consortium (NPRC) Response to the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy (OSTP) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan Request for Information  
March 15, 2025  
The National Payroll Reporting Consortium (NPRC) appreciates the opportunity to provide input on the 
development of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. NPRC is a non -profit trade association 
representing payroll processing service providers that support approximately 48% of th e U.S. workforce. 
NPRC members provide human capital management (HCM) solutions, including payroll services and 
software systems that help clients manage their workforces. HCM platforms offer a range of functions, 
including payroll processing, time -off man agement, recruitment and hiring, performance reviews, 
benefits administration, and employee offboarding.  
AI presents enormous opportunity for payroll processing firms to provide enhanced tools and 
applications to their customers. Whether increasing efficiency through automation, identifying errors 
and ensuring compliance, combatting fraud,  or providing innovative services,  AI is being used  in the 
HCM space for both small and large businesses  and its use is expected to dramatically accelerate. 
Maintaining a balanced regulatory environment that enables and fosters the growth of AI is essential to 
the health of o ur industry and our business clients. To maintain American leadership in AI innovation, 
federal policies must encourage responsible AI deployment while avoiding rigid approaches that stifle 
growth.  
Executive Summary  
Our recommendations align with the principles outlined in the December 2024 Bipartisan House Task 
Force Report on AI, which supports U.S. leadership in responsible AI innovation while implementing 
safeguards to mitigate risks. NPRC’s comments focus on:  
• AI’s role in payroll and workforce management:  AI enhances payroll accuracy,
compliance, and efficiency while reducing administrative burdens for businesses of all sizes.  AI also plays 
a critical role in modern HCM by providing real -time guidance and insights that allow employers to make 
informed workforce management decisions, enhancing employers’ ability to attract and retain their 
workforce.  
• Risk-based approaches to AI governance:  AI frameworks should be proportional  to risk
and avoid one -size-fits-all mandates.  
• AI accountability and transparency:  Governance frameworks, human oversight, and
bias mitigation strategies are essential for fair and reliable AI use.  
• Data integrity, security, and privacy:  Policies should balance strong privacy protections
with preserving AI developers’ legal access to publicly available data for model training.  


2 • Expanding small business access to AI : AI innovation should not be limited to large
enterprises; small businesses need resources and assistance to adopt AI effectively.  
• International cooperation & AI leadership:  The U.S. should help driv e AI governance
globally , harmonizing  AI risk frameworks with international partners.  
• Workforce development & job protection:  AI education and training programs should
expand to ensure American workers benefit from AI rather than being displaced by it.  
AI in Payroll & Workforce Management  
AI-driven automation is transforming payroll and workforce management by enhancing:  
• Accuracy & Compliance:  AI enables real -time error detection, fraud prevention, and
regulatory compliance.  
• Fair Hiring & Workforce Insights:  AI-powered HR tools with human oversight help
mitigate bias, support skills -based hiring, and optimize workforce planning.  
• Efficiency & Cost Reduction:  AI reduces manual administrative burdens while improving
payroll processing and benefits administration.  
To fully realize AI’s potential in workforce management, policies should support responsible AI use while 
avoiding rigid mandates that could increase operational costs without tangible benefits.  
AI Governance: Risk -Based, Reliability -Focused Approaches  
NPRC supports a governance framework that is risk -based  and transparen t. Most p ayroll AI 
applications —focused on compliance, tax automation, and HR management —present minimal risks and 
should be treated differently from high -risk AI uses.  
To balance innovation with accountability, NPRC recommends:  
• A Risk -Tiered Approach:  AI oversight should be proportional to its risk level, avoiding
one-size-fits-all mandates. Payroll and HR AI systems already adhere to strict legal and regulatory 
frameworks, including anti -discrimination, privacy, and employment laws. These existing com pliance 
structures should be leveraged rather than layering on unnecessary new requirements.  
• Developer -led risk evaluation:  AI developers should be responsible for assessing
foreseeable and material risks in their models while ensuring compliance with anti -discrimination and 
workforce protection laws. Evaluations should focus on real -world impacts, and AI developers should 
implement bias detection and mitigation strategies.  
• AI accountability and transparency:  Users should understand how AI operates while
protecting proprietary business information. Businesses should , to the extent practicable : 
oProvide  transparent  AI Governance standards, practices, policies, and processes
with non -technical explanations .
oImplement human oversight measures for AI  solutions  in payroll and hiring.
oEstablish dispute resolution mechanisms for employees or businesses impacted
by AI -driven decisions.
• Corporate AI governance frameworks : AI developers and business users should
implement formal governance policies, including:  
oRegular AI impact assessments and bias mitigation strategies.
oSenior leadership oversight to steer  compliance and ensure fairness.
• Avoiding fragmented AI governance:  AI regulations should be harmonized at the
federal level to prevent a patchwork of inconsistent state and local laws .

 • Ensuring AI regulation is adaptable and technology -neutral : Policies should be flexible, 
iterative, and technology -neutral, applying existing laws rather than imposing unnecessary AI -specific 
compliance burdens.  
 • Ensuring privacy laws remain technology -neutral:  Privacy laws should be applicable 
across technologies and provide flexibility to adapt to evolving AI innovations.  
 • Facilitating access to privacy -enhanced data: The government should support the 
development of privacy -enhancing technologies, such as federated learning and synthetic data, to 
enable AI model training while safeguarding personal information.  
 
Preserving AI Developers’ Legal Access to Training Data  
NPRC urges policymakers to:   
 • Ensure AI developers retain legal access to publicly available data to prevent restrictions 
that limit innovation.  
 • Support privacy -enhancing technologies to allow AI training while protecting individual 
privacy.  
 • Encourage government -facilitated datasets for AI training in workforce applications, 
payroll automation, and tax compliance.  
 
Expanding Small Business Access to AI & Reducing Compliance Burdens  
Small businesses face significant challenges in AI adoption, including high costs, lack of AI expertise, and 
compliance complexities.  
 
NPRC recommends:  
 • Providing AI adoption grants & resources to small businesses, including access to AI -
ready datasets and cloud -based AI tools.  
 • Minimizing unnecessary compliance burdens for small businesses to prevent 
inadvertently limiting competition.  
 • Developing AI training & support programs to help small businesses integrate AI 
effectively.  
 • Investigating resource challenges and providing resources for small businesses, including 
financial assistance and access to compute power for AI adoption.  
 • Ensuring AI regulations do not disproportionately burden small businesses to maintain 
fair market competition.  
 • Encouraging small business participation in AI R&D programs such as the Small Business 
Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) initiatives.  
 
International AI Engagement & Harmonization of Risk Approaches  
NPRC urges the administration to:  
 
 • Ensure the U.S. leads efforts to d evelop and harmonize sensible glo bal AI standards.  
•        Increase U.S. participation in international AI governance efforts to ensure fair and   
       competitive global AI policies .  
•            Align AI risk management with key allies to prevent conflicting AI frameworks.  
 
Strengthening Workforce Development & Protecting American Jobs  
AI should be a tool for augmenting human work, not replacing it. To ensure AI benefits workers rather  
 


4 than displacing jobs, NPRC supports:  
• AI education & training programs (including certifications, apprenticeships, and AI
literacy initiatives) to prepare workers for AI -integrated roles.  
• Reskilling programs for workers impacted by AI to transition into AI -supported jobs
rather than being left behind.  
• Expanding workforce training programs to include technical professionals who may not
have traditional four -year degrees.  
Conclusion  
To maintain American leadership in AI, NPRC urges OSTP to develop policies that support innovation, 
protect against risks, and enable small business participation in AI adoption. A risk -based, industry -
driven approach will promote AI adoption in payroll, t ax compliance, and workforce management while 
ensuring fairness, transparency, and security.
