Hey, my name is Natalie Meng, and I am a 2nd-semester senior at Avonworth High School. I 
studied generative AI and its impact on epidemiology and healthcare for two months in a course on AI and Ethics this year. For my research, I think this current admini stration's 
viewpoint on AI regulation is good for our country’s advancement and global dominance; 
however, it comes with risks. Based on my research, I have found that Artiﬁcial Intelligence 
has begun its impact and has much more potential to change our healthcare and medicine system. AI is an extensive tool that can speed up the analysis of medical imaging, take care of administrative tasks, and reduce the workload of healthcare units that are already understaffed. Patients will be able to receive faster and more accurate diagnoses. Without 
barriers, AI can also further advance preventative healthcare. AI assists the development of vaccines and drugs, which is originally time -consuming and expensive. Removing barriers 
to AI can allow for more free developm ent and efficient use by competitive businesses, 
healthcare units, and individuals. While Executive Order 14179 has created an opening for AI's advancement, I think we should keep in mind that by removing government control and 
regulation on generative AI,  its use becomes more vulnerable to common concerns with it, 
like deepfakes.
