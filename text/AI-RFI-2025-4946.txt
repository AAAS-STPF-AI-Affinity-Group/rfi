General Comment
AI has a place in helping m edicine, but the work of generative AI to essentially steal legitim ately-done works on the Internet and m ash
them  up into soulless, lazily-m ade content that wants to be called "art" but does not deserve to be called such is nothing but a pox on the
world. It saps intense am ounts of energy in order to do this at well, and does nothing to im prove society as m uch as continue to harm  it.
Creative works are beloved m ainly because actual, living people create them , not soulless generative AI that the world is continuing to
hate with a passion, especially am ong investors starting to abandon endeavors and seeing the AI bubble is about to pop.
Generative AI cannot exist without theft. It does not deserve to exist, and to entertain such an idea from  an executive order from  som eone
who has shown to have no knowledge in what he is doing with such an order is nothing but self-destructive.
Am erica runs on entertainm ent, and people will learn when they are seeing soulless junk. Pushing generative AI in the US is the sam e as
poisoning this country, which is not ideal. Do the right thing and do not allow corporations/thieves to continue to beat up Am erica and
em barrass it further in the eyes of others. We are not fooled by what is going on with this faulty technology, and it's tim e to start to
condem n generative AI to it's inevitable doom  while saving true artists: writers, painters, digital artists, voice actors, etc. Prom ote real
people, not generative AI.
