General Comment
Do not let OpenAI use copyrights m aterial to train their AI, it is theft. I don't think AI has a place in the future of the U.S, It is a m ajor
threat. It steals jobs, it steals m aterial, it consum es so m uch energy, yet the Governm ent wants to im plem ent it to control very sensitive
sectors. If anything, AI should be outlawed and Open AI should be shut down or banned from  Governm ent affairs. Again, it steals from
the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off theft.
