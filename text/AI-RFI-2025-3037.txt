General Comment
Generative A.I is not Am erica's future. Generative A.I does not generate wealth. Generative A.I only steals from  people. Think about it;
taking creative jobs from  Am erican people takes away m oney from  the econom y. The creative industry is one of our m ost econom ically
dom inating productions in the entire world. Without artists, voice actors, etc etc, their m oney vanishes from  our world. Even if A.I
produces, there will be less consum ers and therefor less econom ic growth.
Even despite that, A.I's energy usage is far too high and unsustainable.
And even despite *THAT* A.I is wildly unpopular with the populace. Lawsuits have been filed and won against A.I and their theft of
copyrighted m aterials. This should be no different.
Generative A.I has no place in Am erica's future. There are A.I program s that do, but the ones specifically requesting the free use of
copyright m aterial has no place in Am erican culture and in the world. We led the entertainm ent industry into a golden age and this alone
will destroy it.
