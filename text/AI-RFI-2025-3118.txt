General Comment
I do not accept this as AI not only does not have a place in Am erica but will hurt significant industries and workers who put their heart and
soul into their works, and these 'AI' com panies are trying to skirt the copyright and tradem ark rules that are set in the U.S. and will m uddy
the waters of m any franchises.
I do not want this AI technology. period.
