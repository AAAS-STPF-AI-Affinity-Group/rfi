General Comment
AI is not the future of this country. It will only m ake things worse. It will open up endless m eans of exploitation of US citizens, no m atter
what their social stature is. If you are the average citizen, AI can and will be used to replace critical governm ent services which people rely
on every day, and/or scam  you out of your hard earned savings in various new and awful ways. If you are a lawm aker or politician, your
words can and will be used against you by bad actors with free access to AI.
Stop the m adness. Keep the regulations in place.
