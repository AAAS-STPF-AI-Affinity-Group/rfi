General Comment
Generative AI is a wasteful and pointless technology with no proven use case. It is a glorified chatbot that m akes use of excessive am ounts
of energy, water, and other resources to the end of creating error prone statem ents, poorly com posed im ages, and violations of individuals
rights. That it dem ands the law change to m ake the way it builds this engine of waste is absurd, if it cannot exist without stealing then it
should not exist, and instead declaring that its blatant infringem ent of copyright is an exception is sim ilarly absurd and disgusting.
