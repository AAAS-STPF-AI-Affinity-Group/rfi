General Comment
AI is a tool that can be incredibly useful and help us in m any ways, but we should continue to rem em ber it is a tool. AI is not m eant to be
a replacem ent for hum ans, it’s a tool to assist hum ans. As we explore the new world of AI, we shouldn’t bank on the hopes that it can
eventually filter us out but m ake our lives and jobs easier and m ore stream lined.
