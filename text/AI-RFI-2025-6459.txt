General Comment
I am an art ist and have been for as long as I co uld pick up a cra yon and a pe ncil. AI has do ne nothing but harm the environment, steal  
people’s jobs, make th ings even more di fficult and to top it all off having greedy corporates who know NOT HING on what art is 
about to  try and use this to make a qu ick buck cause they’re too f&^% greedy and heartless to stop and th ink that the reason art is 
so loved is cause its made by actual human HANDS and human CR EATIVITY. As an artist and one who has come to call the artist 
community hom e, th is is the highest form of insult to an imators, writers, si ngers and all other artists from arou nd the globe. This is 
how you lose money and busi ness. Stop the AI take over. We are tired of it. Sincerely an artist
