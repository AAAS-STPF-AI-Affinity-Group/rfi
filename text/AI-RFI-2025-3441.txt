General Comment
Rem oving barriers to protect content created from  AI is a disastrous concept and would only serve to bring harm  to the online world. AI
protections are in place for a reason, and this is because without those protections, inform ation and creativity would be used without
restriction or com pensation to those who created the originals, and thus harm  the process of creating and presenting it by m ixing it all
together with program s without regard for anything but spitting out results which are often proven to be blatantly false.
