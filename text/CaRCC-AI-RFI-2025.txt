Introduction 
The Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC) appreciates the opportunity to provide 
input to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) regarding the development of the 
AI Action Plan as directed by Executive Order 14179 (Removing Barriers to American 
Leadership in Artificial Intelligence). CaRCC represents professionals who develop, deploy, and 
support advanced computing and data infrastructure across U.S. academic and research 
institutions. Our community plays a critical role in enabling AI research, education, and 
innovation nationwide, and we are committed to sustaining and enhancing America's global AI 
dominance to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security. 
Priority Policy Recommendations for the AI Action Plan 
1. Establish a National Research Computing and Data Professional
Workforce Initiative
Recommendation: Develop and fund a comprehensive national initiative to expand, diversify, 
and strengthen the research computing and data (RCD) professional workforce. 
Rationale: The United States' ability to maintain global AI dominance is directly dependent on 
having skilled professionals who can build, maintain, and advance the computational 
infrastructure required for AI development without unnecessary regulatory barriers. Currently, 
there is a critical shortage of qualified RCD professionals across academia, industry, and 
government. Without addressing this workforce gap, America's AI capabilities will be severely 
constrained, hampering both economic competitiveness and national security. 


Specific Actions: 
●Create dedicated federal funding streams for universities and research institutions to
recruit, train, and retain RCD professionals
●Establish formal career pathways and professional development opportunities for RCD
professionals, including those specializing in AI infrastructure
●Develop standardized competency models and credentials for RCD professionals that
align with industry needs
●Reduce bureaucratic hurdles that prevent the efficient hiring and retention of technical
talent
●Establish fellowship programs to attract top talent from diverse backgrounds to RCD
careers
2. Create a National Research Computing and Data Infrastructure Program
for AI
Recommendation: Establish a coordinated national program to build, sustain, and enhance 
advanced computing infrastructure specifically designed to support AI research and 
development. 
Rationale: Leading-edge AI research requires substantial computational resources, specialized 
hardware (like advanced GPUs), massive datasets, and most importantly expert people support. 
Many academic institutions lack adequate infrastructure to support cutting-edge AI research, 
creating significant barriers to innovation. The free market alone cannot efficiently address this 
infrastructure gap, particularly for fundamental research that underpins later commercial 
applications. A coordinated national approach would remove these barriers while preserving the 
entrepreneurial spirit that drives American AI leadership. 
Specific Actions: ●Create a national network of AI-ready computing facilities with tiered access for
researchers across the country
●Establish sustainable funding models for the acquisition, operation, and timely refresh of
specialized AI computing hardware
●Develop shared data repositories and pipelines optimized for AI training and testing
●Support energy-efficient computing solutions for AI workloads
●Develop a cadre of RCD professionals to support these goals
3. Integrate Research Computing and Data Professionals into AI Education
and Workforce Development
Recommendation: Formally incorporate research computing and data professionals in AI 
education and training programs at all levels. 


Rationale: Teaching AI concepts without practical, hands-on experience with real AI systems 
limits the effectiveness of education programs. Research computing and data professionals 
possess the practical knowledge needed to bridge theoretical concepts with real-world 
implementation. 
Specific Actions: 
●Fund embedded research computing and data professionals within academic
departments offering AI education
●Develop course materials and curricula that integrate practical AI infrastructure skills
●Create apprenticeship and internship programs that pair students with research
computing and data professionals
●Establish programs to transition skilled professionals from other sectors into research
computing and data roles
4. Remove Barriers to Public-Private Collaboration in AI Infrastructure
Recommendation: Eliminate regulatory obstacles and establish streamlined policy frameworks 
that facilitate collaboration between academic research computing and data organizations and 
private industry. 
Rationale: Effective AI innovation requires seamless collaboration between academic 
researchers and industry. Current administrative, legal, and regulatory barriers—many created 
by previous policies now revoked by Executive Order 14179—have prevented the efficient 
sharing of resources, knowledge, and talent. Removing these barriers will unleash American 
innovation and entrepreneurship in the AI space. 
Specific Actions: ●Create streamlined agreements for public-private partnerships in AI infrastructure
development
●Establish tax incentives for industry donations of computing hardware, software, and
expertise to academic institutions
●Develop fellowship programs that enable professionals to move between industry and
academic research computing and data roles
●Create regulatory frameworks that facilitate responsible data sharing between sectors
5. Support Research Computing and Data as a Critical Component of
National Security
Recommendation: Recognize and support research computing and data infrastructure and 
professionals as essential to national security and American AI dominance. 
Rationale: As AI becomes increasingly important to national security, the professionals who 
develop and maintain AI infrastructure must be viewed as strategic assets. Currently, these 


roles often lack the recognition, support, and protection afforded to other critical infrastructure 
sectors. Strengthening this workforce directly supports the national security objectives outlined 
in Executive Order 14179. 
Specific Actions: 
●Include research computing and data infrastructure in critical infrastructure protection
frameworks
●Develop specialized training and career paths for research computing and data
professionals working on national security applications
●Create rapid response capabilities for research computing and data professionals to
address emerging AI security challenges
●Establish secure environments for sensitive AI research that maintain academic freedom
while protecting national interests
Conclusion 
The United States' global dominance in artificial intelligence depends not only on algorithmic 
breakthroughs and research innovations but also on the robust infrastructure and skilled 
professionals who make that research possible. By investing in and empowering the research 
computing and data professional workforce while removing unnecessary regulatory barriers, the 
AI Action Plan can establish a foundation for sustainable American leadership in artificial 
intelligence that promotes human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security. 
The recommendations presented here align directly with Executive Order 14179's goal of 
removing barriers to American leadership in AI. By addressing critical workforce and 
infrastructure needs while maintaining a light regulatory touch, we can ensure America 
maintains its competitive edge in this transformative technology. 
CaRCC stands ready to collaborate with OSTP, the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and other 
stakeholders to implement these recommendations and contribute to the development of a 
comprehensive AI Action Plan that ensures America's continued global dominance in artificial 
intelligence.
