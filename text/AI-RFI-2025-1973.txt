General Comment
I am  a sm all business owner in the entertainm ent sector. I am  here tot tell you that no entertainm ent sector will exist if you do this. Every
single creative com pany will flee this country and all our m ovies will be in Chinese. AI will not prevent this, but hasten it. 
AI takes am erican jobs and hands them  to chinese people, period.
