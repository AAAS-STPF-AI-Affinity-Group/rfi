General Comment
Not having lim itations on AI will negatively im pact a lot of Am ericans by taking away these lim itations you are doom ing a large industry of
people in favor of a device that doesn't need to explore a LOT of these categories. Rather than focusing on this put it into m ore productive
uses where people will actually want it and where it'll benefit the m asses.
