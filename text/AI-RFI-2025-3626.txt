General Comment
AI has no future and is a dead end unworthy of investm ent. You cannot build the future on a foundation that consists of nothing, knows
nothing, and contributes nothing. 
Loosening the reins on a pale horse does not change the collapse that follows it, and the regurgitance engine is already dying.
If you continue to feed the m achine, we will sm ash it.
Stop wasting our tim e.
