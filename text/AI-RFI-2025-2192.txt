General Comment
There is no ethical use of generative AI.
Generative AI does not create original content.
Generative AI cannot and will not replace hum an creatives.
Following through with this plan would be unethical, unfair, and unnecessary. It would hurt and devalue hum an creators. It is an attem pt to
legalize theft. 
Artists, authors, and content creators will be harm ed. The proposed plan shows the adm inistration's blatant disregard for the livelihood of
these people.
Again. There is no ethical use of generative AI.
