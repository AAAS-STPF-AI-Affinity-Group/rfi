General Comment
I do not believe AI has any place using copyrighted work to train on. It's grossly overblown technology that is at best just auto-com plete
with a fee. AI has already polluted search engines, from  incorrect representations of living beings and locations, to outright lies and sm ear
cam paigns that are annoying to discern from  fact. Based on precedent, The current m ethods of obtaining data is im m oral at best and illegal
at worst.
It's a sign of being cheap, willing to steal but unwilling to pay people for their work. The m ore people are aware of its use, the m ore that
will turn away from  engaging with those that use it.
