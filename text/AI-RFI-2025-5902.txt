General Comment
AI holds no place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m any Am ericans’ livelihoods and profits off of theft and plagiarism . AI is a
danger to the general public as it causes environm ental dam age and rapid resource depletion. AI obscures and hides the truth which will
not be tolerated as it is owed to the Am erican people.
