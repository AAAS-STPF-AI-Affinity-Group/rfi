AI is not magical and does not miraculously fix everything. AI is a way of processing human 
knowle dge and skill. That process is neither inherently accurate nor inherently beneficial. Some 
examples of the failures of AI are hallucinations and revenge porn. Specifically, the government needs to develop protections for copyrighted materials that might be exploited for profit without benefiting the creator or holder of the copyright. We have already seen over and over again AI programs used to harvest artists'  work without consent. The material generated from that AI also 
needs scrutiny. Deep fakes, harmful advice, and scams created through AI are already here. The problem will only get worse as the technology becomes more prevalent. Industrialization brought about cheaper and better goods, but it also generated tremendous amounts of pollution. There was so much pollution that rivers regularly caught on fire by the 1970s. I fear similar large systemic problems will occur without some circumspection on AI.
