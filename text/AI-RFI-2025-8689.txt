General Comment
AI as used by ChatGPT and other such products is an inform ational and creative dead end. To rem ove the protections of sm all creatives
in the interest of creating plagiarism  m achines could be the death knell of U.S culture, while offering no m eans of actual profit or
productivity. Do not rem ove any protections for the sake of AI that Am ericans do not want.
