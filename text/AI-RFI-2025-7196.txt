General Comment
Giving OpenAI (and, likely, all AI com panies) carte blanche to steal the creative work of hum an beings in the pursuit of com m ercial
products intended to replace creative hum an efforts flies in the face of Art1 ยง8 c8 of the US Constitution.
It will stifle hum an artists while solely prom oting the interests of big tech.
I firm ly believe that we need a hum an centric copyright regim e, likely one with a progressively increasing reregistration schem e, so that
m ore works enter the public dom ain rather than becom ing abandoned because they have no long tail. 
But to preference IP theft by big tech over hum an artists is egregious.
