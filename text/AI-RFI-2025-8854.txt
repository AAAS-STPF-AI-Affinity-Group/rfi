General Comment
As an artist the ability to create m y own work and share it with m y fellow hum ans is the m ost im portant part of m y craft. By openly
allowing A.I harvesting without m y explicit requested consent, m y ability to sustain m yself, and the livelihood of those I cherish is
jeopardized.
