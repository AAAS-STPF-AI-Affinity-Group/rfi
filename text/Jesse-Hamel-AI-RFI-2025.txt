Executive Summary 
The United States faces an unprecedented challenge to maintain AI and autonomy 
supremacy against the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) predatory strategy, targeting 
global dominance by 2030 with $150 billion in state-backed investment. VICTUS 
Technologies, Inc., founded at MIT by Jesse Hamel—r etired USAF Lt. Col., AC-130 Gunship 
combat aviator, AFSOC drone squadron commander, and MIT graduate—and his brother 
Jordan Hamel, a former Microsoft and Stripe engineer, submits this response to shape the 
AI Action Plan under Executive Order 14179. Our expertise in resilient autonomy informs a 
seven-pillar framework to secure U.S. leadership over China’s model of theft and control. 
These pillars are: (1) FAA adoption of Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations 
resilient to signal disruption; (2) simulation-based machine learning for agile AI validation; 
(3) exclusion of CCP-tied entities; (4) aggressive legal action against CCP IP theft; (5)  
prioritization of clean code AI; (6) rapid funding for U.S. small tech startups; and (7) DHS  
and CBP deployment of ﬂexible, CCP-resistant autonomous systems for border security. 
This roadmap dismantles China’s advantages—$600 billion in annual IP theft, pervasive  
inﬁltration, and electronic warfare prowess—while forging a decentralized, American-l ed 
AI future aligned with democratic values. The stakes demand bold action to outpace and 
outlast the CCP.
Introduction: The CCP Threat and America’s Response 
China’s AI strategy, codiﬁed in its 2017 “New Generation AI Development Plan” (State 
Council of China, 2017), is a $150 billion assault on U.S. technological primacy, aiming for 
global dominance by 2030. The CCP’s arsenal—I P theft costing $225-$600 billion yearly (IP 
Commission, 2021), forced tech transfers, and proxies like Huawei and the Thousand 
Talents Program (FBI, 2020)—exploits America’s openness. Autonomy is a ﬂashpoint: DJI’s

showcase China’s edge, while U.S. systems lag under regulatory and security constraints.  
About the Author  
VICTUS Technologies, Inc., launched at MIT by Jesse Hamel, whose USAF career included 
AC-130 combat and AFSOC drone command, and Jordan Hamel, a Microsoft and Stripe 
veteran, embodies America’s counter -potential. Our work in GPS -denied autonomy reﬂects 
the urgency of this race. EO 14179’s deregulation pivot is a start, but beating China requires 
a strategic overhaul —out-innovating their scale, out -securing their theft, and out -scaling 
their centralizati on across military, economic, and bor der domains. This response delivers 
that vision.  
1. FAA Adoption of BVLOS for Resilient Autonomy
The Challenge:  China’s autonomy dominance —DJI’s market grip and PLA’s signal -denial
tactics (DoD, 2023) —exploits U.S. LOS limits and GPS vulnerabilities. BVLOS could unlock
a $127 billion market (MarketsandMarkets, 2023), but FAA delays past 2026 cede this to
Beijing.
Policy Vision:  Mandate BVLOS by 2026, prioritizing AI resilience in GPS -loss and no -signal 
environments —key to countering China’s electronic warfare.  
Recommendations:  
Amend FAA Reauthorization Act for BVLOS rules by July 2026, requiring 95% path accuracy 
in jamming tests (NIST, 2024). Fund with $100M. Launch a 120 -day certiﬁcation track for 
resilient BVLOS platforms, validated by DoD, with $50M annually for 50 systems by 2028. 
Invest $150M in an FAA -DoD consortium for real -world BVLOS trials, certifying 20 platforms 
by 2027. Lead ICAO to adopt U.S. protocols, countering China’s airspace inﬂuence 
(Reuters, 2023).  
Impact:  Secures a $200B market and military edge over China by 2035.  
2. Simulation -Based Machine Learning for Agile AI Validation
The Challenge:  China’s rapid AI deployment —e.g., Xinjiang surveillance (Human Rights
Watch, 2021) —bypasses U.S. -style explainability burdens, delaying autonomy in chaotic
settings.
Policy Vision:  Use simulation -based ML with agentic goal -setting, honed by Jesse Hamel 
at AFSOC, to validate AI against CCP stressors without stiﬂing innovation.

This document is approved for public dissemination  3 Recommendations:  
Mandate NIST/FAA simulation standards by 2027, focusing on 98% mission success 
(funded at $75M). Invest $300M in an open -source platform to mimic PLA tactics (CSIS, 
2022), targeting 100 adopters by 2029. Fund a $200M National Simulation ML Academy for 
20,0 00 engineers by 2033, rivaling China’s STEM output (UNESCO, 2023). Require 
simulation validation for DoD AI by 2028 ($100M).  
Impact:  Speeds trusted AI deployment, outpacing China’s opaque systems.  
3. Exclusion of CCP -Tied Entities from U.S. AI Ecosystems
The Challenge:  CCP proxies —Huawei’s $75B 5G (Bloomberg, 2023), Tencent’s $50B
investments (Reuters, 2022), 1,689 Thousand Talents recruits (FBI, 2020) —siphon AI to
Beijing.
Policy Vision:  Ban CCP inﬂuence as a security red line, protecting hubs like MIT, where 
VICTUS began.  
Recommendations:  
Bar CCP -linked entities from federal AI contracts by 2026, with $50M for CFIUS audits (e.g., 
Huawei vendors, DOJ, 2022). Mandate transparency for university funding by 2025, 
debarment for CCP ties (e.g., MIT case, FBI, 2021), funded at $75M. Expand Entity List to 
500+ ﬁrms by 2027 ($100M), targeting Huawei chip smuggling (Reuters, 2023). Lead NATO 
to exclude CCP tech, countering $10B Belt and Road deals (World Bank, 2022).  
Impact:  Forces China onto inferior tech, preserving U.S. sovereignty.  
4. Aggressive Legal Action Against CCP IP Theft
The Challenge:  CCP theft —$600B yearly (IP Commission, 2021) —fuels ﬁrms like Baidu
(CSIS, 2021) and iFlytek (FBI, 2021), hitting startups hardest.
Policy Vision:  Make theft a liability, reﬂecting Jesse Hamel’s USAF ﬁght -back ethos.  
Recommendations:  
Fund $200M annually to sue CCP entities, targeting $15B damages by 2030 (e.g., SMIC, 
DOJ, 2023). Seek $100B TRIPS sanctions by 2028 for drone tech theft (Reuters, 2022). 
Subsidize $50M yearly for small ﬁrms to litigate (e.g., iFlytek, 2021). Push INTERPOL  for an 
IP court by 2029 ($25M), citing Huawei’s 2019 hack (DOJ, 2019).  
Impact:  Drains China’s resources, protecting U.S. innovation.

The Challenge:  CCP tech —Huawei backdoors (NSA, 2022), ByteDance opacity (Senate,
2023) —compromises U.S. AI. Jordan Hamel’s clean code ethos oners a ﬁx.
Policy Vision:  Mandate clean, U.S. -origin code for security and sovereignty.  
Recommendations:  
Require clean code in government AI by 2031 ($250M, NSA audits; e.g., Tencent in DoD, 
GAO, 2023). Oner $2B tax credits for 1,000 ﬁrms by 2030. Lead Five Eyes clean code 
standard by 2028 ($50M), isolating CCP tech ($300B market, IMF , 2023). Invest $75M to  
trace code (e.g., Lenovo, DHS, 2022).  
Impact:  Hardens U.S. AI against CCP threats.  
6. Rapid Funding for U.S. Small Tech Startups
The Challenge:  China’s $20B AI subsidies (CSIS, 2023) and Big Tech’s Beijing ties (e.g.,
Microsoft’s $1B lab, Reuters, 2021) outpace U.S. startups like VICTUS.
Policy Vision:  Fuel small ﬁrms to outscale China’s monoliths.  
Recommendations:  
Launch $1B annual fund, granting $5M –$50M in 75 days to 200 ﬁrms by 2027, CCP ties 
barred. Cut SBIR/STTR to 30 days, $400M yearly for 500 projects by 2029. Seed 20 hubs 
with $100M each, training 75,000 workers by 2035, countering $5B CCP VC (Forbes, 2022) . 
Ban CCP -linked VC funding ($25M enforcement; e.g., Sequoia, WSJ, 2023).  
Impact:  Unleashes U.S. dynamism against China’s centralization.  
7. DHS and CBP Deployment of CCP -Resistant Autonomous Systems for Border
Security
The Challenge:  The U.S. border —2,000 miles with Mexico alone —faces escalating threats
from CCP electronic warfare and proxies. In 2023, CBP seized drones with Chinese
components smuggling fentanyl, linked to PLA -grade jamming tech (CBP , 2023). Existing
systems, reliant on GPS and vulnerable to CCP signal attacks (e.g., 2022 Huawei jamming
spikes, DHS, 2022), fail in rugged, signal -denied terrains. China’s Xinjiang drone
surveillance (HRW, 2021) shows their border tech sophistication —ours must exceed it.
Policy Vision:  Equip DHS and CBP with ﬂexible, autonomous systems resistant to CCP 
electronic attacks, leveraging AI to secure borders against smuggling, tranicking, and 
espionage. Jesse Hamel’s AFSOC experience with resilient drones underscores this need —
border secur ity is a national security frontier.

This document is approved for public dissemination  5 Recommendations:  
Require DHS to deploy 500 CCP -resistant drones by 2028, funded at $200M, capable of 
95% uptime in jamming scenarios (NIST, 2024). Partner with U.S. ﬁrms to prototype by 
2026. Establish a $150M CBP Autonomy Center in El Paso, TX, by 2027, testing AI -driven  
systems against PLA -style electronic attacks (e.g., 2023 PLA jamming drills, CSIS, 2023). 
Deploy 50 units annually. Invest $100M to harden border drones against CCP spooﬁng, 
mandating clean code and onboard AI (e.g., countering Huawei’s 2022 5G interference, 
NSA, 2022). Certify 20 models by 2027. Create a $75M DHS fast -track fund for small U.S. 
ﬁrms to supply resistant autonomy by 2026, excluding CCP -tied vendors (e.g., DJI, banned 
2021, CBP , 2021).  
Impact:  Secures borders against CCP -enabled threats, setting a $50B autonomy standard 
China can’t breach.  
Conclusion: A Legacy of Leadership  
China’s AI threat is a test of American resolve —economic ($750B market), military (border 
to battleﬁeld), and moral (freedom vs. control). VICTUS Technologies, Inc., born at MIT by 
Jesse Hamel’s combat -honed vision and Jordan Hamel’s tech mastery, oners this seven -
pillar plan as a national imperative. From BVLOS to border drones, we must outpace the 
CCP’s $150B juggernaut and $600B theft. Our AFSOC and MIT roots position us to advise 
OSTP , NITRD, and Congress in closed s ession —America’s AI future hangs in the balance.
