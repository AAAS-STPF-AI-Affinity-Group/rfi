I am a private citizen and I obviously prefer that the United States lead in AI technology. 
However, I have concerns on the specifications and controls that define the boundary of AI 
ingesting all data. So, who/what will keep it's intelligence level at a l evel that can still be 
controlled by it's creators, and it does not end up controlling it's creators. I do not believe that's 
an unreasonable concern given the nature of AI and man, and the fact that the technology 
companies are still using it to continue to censor Americans and others across the globe. I'm fully 
aware that President Trump has said - "no more censoring on the platforms." FB is still censoring 
especially if you're a conservative and/or a Christian. I and my friends continue to put up with 
the sleight of hand. So, how do you intend to prevent AI from being controlled in that manner. It 
is encouraging that this administration is very transparent and I hope all Americans continue to 
be involved, and don't fall asleep at the wheel like we did las t time... Thank you!
