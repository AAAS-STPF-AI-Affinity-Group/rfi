General Comment
The rights of independent developers and artists are not 'burdensom e' barriers for AI developm ent. They are the rights of Am erican
citizens to own what they create. AI com panies refusing to cooperate and work with the rights of Am erican citizens is due to their greedy
am bition, not honorable am bition. This law is an attack upon individual and independent creative rights.
