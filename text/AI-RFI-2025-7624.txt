General Comment
This is ridiculous. AI com panies cannot be allowed to flagrantly flout copyright law and steal what people have created. If AI is so
revolutionary a technology, surely these com panies can afford to properly license the m aterials they need for training data. We cannot
allow these com panies to be built up on the theft from  m illions of people. Violating copyright protections woyld stifle Am erican innovation
as well as further harm  out standing in the international com m unity.
