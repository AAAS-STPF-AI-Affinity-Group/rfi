General Comment
I think allowing for free use of copyrighted m aterial to train AI is a terrible decision. Not only will it reduce the ability for artists, writers,
and other creatives to profit from  their works (who will pay full prince when you can just get the AI to generate it for you?) but it also
opens a loophole to allow free use of copyrighted m aterial as long as you claim  to be training an AI. I strongly suggest that regulations be
put in place to prevent this.
