General Comment
As an AI art hobbyist using tools like Stable Diffusion and NovelAI weekly, and often using LLMs to help with coding, I urge you to
prioritize policies that foster innovation, and allow for further developm ent of AI and GenAI without overregulation.
I believe AI m odels should be allowed to be trained on publicly available data, including copyrighted m aterial, provided that the outputs
are transform ative. Generative AI is a tool for creating new art and ideas.
AI based technology is valuable. It allows for new ways of collaborating with com puters, innovation, and iteration of ideas. Overly strict
controls would underm ine this, jeopardizing U.S. com petitiveness. Even as som eone living in Finland, I feel like policies you m ake today
will effect the direction of Europe too.
AI is also som ething that personally m akes m e feel like we are "living in the future", as it allows for m any tasks that I thought im possible
before. For exam ple, recently there have been lot of news of China building versatile robots that use AI-driven m ovem ent, and in Japan
there is a thriving AI art com m unity that m akes alternative tools for generation and m anipulation of im ages, videos and m usic.
I fully support the outlined plan, if it helps to save resources for further AI developm ent.
