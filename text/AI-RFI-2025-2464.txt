General Comment
Please do not encourage the use of generative A.I. with creative works like film s and anim ation. Without a hum an creator who actually
writes, acts, illustrates, and so on, A.I. can only im itate what's been done. And that will only stagnate Am erica's industry and ruin both
jobs and the products them selves. It will hurt trust in brands and intellectual properties in the long run.
AI-generated content cannot even be copyrighted, so from  a financial standpoint anyone can freely pirate it as their own and lessen the
profits of com panies. Not even the organizations creating generative AI can protect their own work from  infringem ent, especially when it
already works off stolen data and assets without perm ission (including Disney and Netflix).
