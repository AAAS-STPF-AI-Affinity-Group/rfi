General Comment
Under no circum stances should AI be able to circum vent copyright law. The hard work of artists, writers, reporters is their own. We
cannot surrender what is to be hum an to a m achine that can’t even accurately describe the taste of bread. Am ericans want to work and
we’ve never needed AI before. We won’t need it in the future because there is no future for generative AI.
