Uniform Standards for Operational AI Models 
The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse sectors, from healthcare and 
finance to transportation and governance, necessitates the urgent establishment of comprehensive 
standards for operational AI models. While the potential benefits of AI are undeniable, the 
absence of robust standards leaves us vulnerable to unpredictable performance, ethical breaches, 
and a lack of public trust. Establishing standardized frameworks for calibration, validation, and 
Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), among other aspects, is crucial for responsible and 
effective AI deployment. 
Calibration and Validation: Ensuring Reliability and Accuracy 
AI models, particularly those based on machine learning, are inherently data-driven. Their 
performance is heavily reliant on the quality and representativeness of the training data. Without 
proper calibration, models can exhibit biases, inaccuracies, and a lack of generalizability. 
Standardized calibration procedures would ensure that models are fine-tuned to accurately reflect 
real-world conditions, mitigating the risk of systematic errors. 
Similarly, rigorous validation is essential for assessing the model's performance and robustness. 
Standardized validation protocols would define clear metrics for evaluating accuracy, precision, 
recall, and other relevant performance indicators. This would not only provide a quantifiable 
measure of the model's effectiveness but also allow for comparisons across different AI systems. 
Standardized validation would also mandate stress testing to understand the performance 
boundaries of the model, and to identify potential failure modes. This is especially critical in 
safety-critical applications. 
Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs): Guiding Development and Deployment 
The concept of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), originally developed by NASA, provides a 
valuable framework for assessing the maturity of a technology. Applying TRLs to AI models 
would establish a clear roadmap for development, from initial research to full-scale deployment. 
Standardized TRL definitions for AI would provide a common language for researchers, 
developers, and regulators to communicate about the progress and readiness of AI systems. 
For instance, a model in TRL 3 might demonstrate basic functionality in a controlled 
environment, while a model in TRL 9 would be fully integrated and operational in its intended 
The Tomorrow Companies Inc. | 2025  5 


environment. This framework would facilitate a more structured and transparent approach to AI 
development, ensuring that models are deployed only when they have reached an appropriate 
level of maturity and reliability. It would also allow for better risk management, by identifying 
potential challenges at each stage of development.  
The need for standards extends beyond technical aspects to encompass ethical considerations and 
accountability. Standardized frameworks should address issues such as data privacy, algorithmic 
bias, transparency, and explainability. These standards must also guide the creation of clear lines 
of responsibility for the development, deployment, and maintenance of AI models. Furthermore, 
standardized audit trails and documentation requirements would enhance accountability and 
facilitate independent verification of AI system performance. This would build public trust and 
ensure that AI systems are used responsibly and ethically.  
Establishing effective standards requires a collaborative effort involving researchers, developers, 
industry stakeholders, policymakers, and the public. International cooperation is also crucial to 
ensure consistency and interoperability across different jurisdictions. By establishing robust 
standards for operational AI models, we can unlock the full potential of this transformative 
technology while mitigating its risks. This will pave the way for a future where AI is deployed 
responsibly, ethically, and for the benefit of all. 
Safeguarding the Rocketfuel of AI: Data 
The explosive growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hinges on access to vast, diverse, and 
high-quality datasets. However, current data licensing practices often create significant barriers, 
hindering innovation and stifling responsible AI development. These barriers include: 
●“Public Release” End User License Agreements (EULA): These types of open licensing
agreements allow companies to purchase proprietary data once and make it available to
the general public. These types of EULAs are often-times incompatible with the business
model of innovative companies at the forefront of developing proprietary data sets.
●Uncertainty and Ambiguity : Vague licensing language creates legal uncertainty,
discouraging investment and hindering collaboration.
The Solution: Policies that safeguard and promote companies at the forefront of developing 
proprietary data sets. 
To foster a thriving and responsible AI ecosystem, we need to promote "friendly" data licensing 
terms that prioritize: 
The Tomorrow Companies Inc. | 2025  6 


●Flexibility and Accessibility:  Licenses should offer flexible usage rights, allowing for a
wide range of AI applications, including research, development, and commercialization.
Fair and reasonable pricing models are also essential.
●Transparency and Accountability:  Data provenance and usage tracking mechanisms
should be implemented to ensure transparency and accountability.
●Standardization: Developing industry-wide standards for data licensing can streamline
the process and reduce legal uncertainty.
The nature of data licensing carries profound implications for the future of artificial intelligence 
policy. By establishing business-friendly licensing terms, we can unlock the vast potential of AI, 
granting wider access to the critical datasets that fuel its development. Equitable participation in 
the AI landscape is also crucial. Accessible data licensing acts as a leveler, ensuring that smaller 
companies and research institutions, often constrained by resources, can contribute meaningfully 
to AI advancements. Beyond innovation and fairness, public trust is paramount. Transparent and 
ethical data licensing practices are essential in cultivating confidence in AI technologies. 
Moreover, responsible AI development necessitates clear guidelines and ethical considerations 
embedded within licensing agreements, ensuring that AI systems are built with integrity. Finally, 
as AI regulations continue to emerge, business-friendly data licensing will streamline 
compliance, making it easier for developers to adhere to evolving legal frameworks. 
Call to Action: Policymakers should incentivize the development and adoption of business- 
friendly data licensing terms; we propose the implementation of clear, flexible, and accessible 
data licensing terms to fuel AI innovation. This includes policies that safeguard and promote 
companies at the forefront of developing proprietary data sets.  Section 3. Tomorrow.io AI Capabilities Statement
