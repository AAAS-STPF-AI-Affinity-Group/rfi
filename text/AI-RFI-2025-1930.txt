General Comment
I am  a working artist. I also teach art to young people who are largely not entering the creative professions. We do not need AI. We are
sm art enough, creative enough, and this fad is a cheap and callow way to m ake those of us working in creative industries give up our
hard-earned skills to a m achine that gives us zero credit, zero com pensation, and forces us to bid against an increasingly low bottom  line.
This will not help Am ericans--it will train us out of problem  solving, it will offer solutions that can only ever be the distillation of things other
have said. It will kill innovation and hom ogenize creative output for decades to com e. It's trash, plain and sim ple, and only exists to enrich
those who benefit from  a populace that has gotten out of the habit of thinking too hard.
