AI-Driven Additive Manufacturing for Defense Readiness and Supply 
Chain Resilience  
I.Executive Summary
No single  investment in A rtificial Intelligence (AI) will have a greater impact on America ’s technological 
supremacy, national security  posture, and sustained economic prosper ity than investment in AI to support 
American  manufacturin g. 
Based on the  evolving character of warfare and height ened industrial competition , we urge the Office of Science 
and Technology Policy (OST P) to include provisions in the AI Action Plan that drive insertion of  AI-enabled 
advanced manufacturing technology within America’ s public and private sector factories  
Advancemen ts in AI have enabled develop ment of AI-integrated Additive Manufacturing (AI -AM) systems to 
enhance and support defense readiness, supply chain resilience, and national security. This white paper  provides 
a recommended roadm ap for implementing a strategic initiative to incorporate AI into American Additive 
Manufacturing and support on- demand, decentralized production of critical components . If execut ed, this 
initiative will ensure  that the U.S. defense industrial base can leap ahead of global compet itors in next-generation 
manufacturing innovation, produce hardware at the s cale required to  sustain high- intensity conflict scenarios , and 
win economic competition with strategic rivals like China.  
By levera ging AI for design optimization, predictive maintenance, and production scalability, the U.S. can fortify 
its manufacturing sector, reduce reliance on global supply chains, and sustain a competitive advantage in 
emerging technological battlefields.  
II.Background: The Strategic Imperative for AI-Enabled Additive Manufacturing
The National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing, released in October  2022 by the Committee on Technology 
of the National Science and T echnology Council, highlight ed AI as a transformative force in modern industry. 
However, gaps in domestic manufacturing capability—particularly in defense -related sectors —remain and 
continue to pose a critical vulnerability.  This plan, and many similar strategic documents published by DoD, 
congressional interest s, think tanks, and academia, have highlighted several key challenges  to increasing US 
production.  These include: 
•Declining U.S. Manufacturing Capacity : The U.S. has underinvested in industrial production for
decades, leading to vulnerabilities in defense supply chains.
•Supply Chain Disruptions : Dependencies on overseas suppliers, particularly for high- tech components
and raw materials, create national security risks.
•Great Power Conflict and Emerging Warfare Trends:


oThe Russia- Ukraine War demonstrated that low -cost mass production of artillery shells, drones, and
electronic warfare systems is essential for sustained operations.
oThe Israel -Hamas Conflict  underscored the effectiveness of low- cost, mass -produced drones and
loitering munitions in asymmetric warfare.
These deve lopments suggest that future conflicts will demand rapid, large -scale production of essential defense 
assets – a requirement  that America ’s legacy industrial infrastructure is ill- equipped to meet. Greater insertion of 
AI coupled with AI -enabled advanced manufacturing techniques  can directly addres s these challenges  by 
turbocharging A merican indust ry to outmatch foreign production and deter strategic rivals.  
III.AI-Enabled Additive Manufacturing: A Strategic Response
The Artificial Intelligence Action Plan  should include provisioning for a federal  AI-integrated Additive 
Manufacturing ( AI-AM) initiative that aligns with existing DoD, NASA, DARPA, and defense contractor efforts 
to integrate AI -driven smart manufacturing into the defense industrial base. This initiative should promote to the 
greatest exten t possible  integration of the following AI -enabled techno logies within public and private 
manufacturi ng operations across the US. This should include both design/manufacturing of new products and an 
examination /potential redesign of existing and legacy products.   
A. AI-Augmente d Design Optimization  for Perform ance and Production
•AI-driven generative design software tools to optimize product structures  to minimize material usage and
manufacturing costs while maximizing manufacturability and product performance (e.g., product strength,
mass).
•Machine learning algorithms for real- time process control and quality assurance in AM facilities.
•AI-enabled software t ooling to produce di gital twin models and iteratively  test these models against
physical requirements , resulting in 3D printable computer- aided designs (CAD) that can be rapidly
produced using AM printers.
B. Predict ive Maintenance & Supply Chain Resilience
•AI-powered predictive analytics to identify potential component failures before they occur.
•Automated production scheduling to adapt manufacturing output to emerging defense needs.
C. AI-Integrated Manufacturing for Critical Defense Needs
•Rapid transitioning of CAD drawings to AM printers to flexibly produce defense critical structures  at
scale, incl uding:
oHigh-performance autonomous UAVs, hypersonic components, and space systems.
oSustainment components for legacy systems (to solve parts obsolescence issues) .
IV.Implementation Roadmap
The Artificial Intelligence Action Plan  can support the  Implementation and proliferation  of AI-AM through 
mandating a three- phase approach .  
Phase 1 (2025- 2027): AI Integration into Defense Manufacturing 
•Call for establishment of AI -AM pilot programs within DoD and partner agencies.
•Deploy AI -driven generative design software and predictive maintenance capabilities within  existing AM
Facilities and Government-operated manufacturing Centers of Excellence.
•Invest in AI-powered digital twins for manufacturing process and performance optimization.


•Design and implement a compartmentalized digital infrastructure to integrate secure and reliable AI
capabilities into manufacturing workflows and existing industrial control systems, defending AI -AM
capabilities from foreign adversarie s.
Phase 2 (2027- 2029): Scaling AI- AM for Defense & Civilian Applications  
•Expand decentralized AI- AM factory hubs across US to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.
•Implement AI -driven logistics and predictive procurement to enhance DoD supply chain resilience.
Phase 3 (2029- 2032): Full AI-AM Integration into U.S. Industrial Base  
•Establish AI -AM as the default manufacturing process for critical defense components.
•Continue expanding decentralized AI -AM factory hubs , including to allied nations,  to create a resilient
allied manufacturing network that promotes rapid AI-enabled manufacturing a nd innovation across allied
industrial bases.
•Strengthen cybersecurity measures to protect nationwide -network of AI -AM capabilities from foreign
adversaries.
V.Expected Impact & Strategic Advantages
Through rec ommending implementation  of the AI-AM initiative , the AI Action Plan will deliver benefits to the 
US industri al base and broader economy including:  
•Supply Chain Security : Reduced dependency on overseas suppliers for critical military components.
•Cost Savings : AI-driven process efficiencies lower material and labor costs.
•Operational Readiness : On-demand production reduces equipment downtime and enhances force agility.
•Economic Growth : Strengthened domestic manufacturing base creates high -tech jobs and innovation
hubs.
VI.Conclusion
AI-enabled Additive Manufacturing is not just an option—it is a strategic mandate to ensure U.S. national security 
and industrial resilience. Through including the AI -AM initiative in  the AI Action Plan, the US Government can  
leverage AI to rebuild America’s defense industrial base and sustain its technological advantage.
