7.1 Oversight and Enforcement  
The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) will oversee AI integration in federal 
procurement and ensure compliance with this policy.  
Agency Chief Procurement Officers (CPOs) must certify annually that AI -assisted evaluations 
follow these guidelines.  
NIST and GSA will establish an AI evaluation framework to support responsible AI procurement 
practices.  
7.2 Compliance Reporting  
Agencies must submit an annual AI Use Report detailing compliance measures, AI impact on 
evaluations, and audit findings.  
GAO will conduct periodic reviews to assess adherence to AI procurement policies.  
7.3 Continuous Improvement  
This policy will be reviewed and updated every two years to align with technological 
advancements and legal developments.  
CONCLUSION  
The responsible integration of AI in federal procurement can enhance efficiency, but it must be 
implemented with strong governance, transparency, and human oversight. These policies ensure 
that AI supports, rather than replaces, human judgment, while uphol ding federal procurement 
integrity.

FAIRNESS WITHOUT BURDENING INDUSTRY  
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in federal procurement evaluations represents a 
significant opportunity for industry stakeholders, streamlining processes, reducing administrative 
overhead, and increasing efficiency. However, as with any tec hnological advancement, concerns 
may arise regarding additional regulatory requirements and the potential burden on contractors. 
The policies outlined in this framework are designed to facilitate innovation, ensure fair 
competition, and enhance transparenc yâ€”without imposing unnecessary constraints on industry 
partners.  
8 Enhancing Fair Competition and Leveling the Playing Field  
Far from being restrictive, these policies create a more predictable and equitable procurement 
environment for all offerors, including small businesses and non -traditional contractors. By 
requiring AI -driven evaluations to be transparent and explainable, b usinesses gain better insight 
into how their proposals are assessed. This reduces ambiguity and ensures companies are 
competing on a clear, well -defined basis rather than an opaque, AI -driven process that could favor 
incumbents or larger firms.  
â€¢How This Helps Industry:  Offerors receive greater visibility into AI scoring criteria,
enabling them to tailor their proposals more effectively and reduce unnecessary bid protests.
â€¢Why Itâ€™s Not a Burden:  Transparency requirements do not require extra effort from
industry; instead, they ensure that agencies using AI provide clear guidance on evaluation
methodologies, making it easier for businesses to align with expectations.
9 Encouraging Innovation Without Overregulation  
AI has the potential to streamline federal proposal evaluations, making the process faster and more 
efficient. These policies ensure that agencies use AI as a tool to assist human evaluators â€”not as a 
rigid, inflexible decision -making system. By requiring h uman oversight and final approval, the 
policy preserves the ability of offerors to showcase innovation, unique approaches, and qualitative 
differentiators that AI alone might overlook.  
â€¢How This Helps Industry:  Businesses that bring cutting -edge solutions or novel technical
approaches  will not be at a disadvantage due to AI misinterpretation of complex
methodologies.
â€¢Why Itâ€™s Not a Burden:  No additional reporting or certification is required from
contractors; instead, federal agencies bear the responsibility of ensuring AI does not
introduce bias or unfair exclusions.
10 Reducing Risk of Bid Protests and Increasing Predictability  
Bid protests are costly, time -consuming, and disruptive for both agencies and contractors. The 
policies outlined, including mandated AI bias audits, explainable AI, and clear scoring 
methodologies, help reduce the risk of protests by ensuring evaluations a re conducted in a fair and 
defensible manner.

developing the AI Action Plan and associated documents without attribution.  â€¢How This Helps Industry:  A transparent AI evaluation process reduces uncertainty and
frustration, making procurement outcomes more predictable and reducing unnecessary legal
costs.
â€¢Why Itâ€™s Not a Burden:  Contractors do not need to take any additional steps; instead, they
benefit from agencies ensuring AI -driven decisions are clear, well -documented, and easily
able to be challenged  if errors occur.
11 Protecting Proprietary and Sensitive Business Data  
One of the primary concerns of industry stakeholders is data security. AI systems processing 
proprietary proposal data must comply with the highest security standards, including encryption, 
access controls, and U.S. -based infrastructure. These safeguards e nsure that contractor -sensitive 
information is not exposed to unauthorized access, foreign adversaries, or unvetted AI algorithms.  
â€¢How This Helps Industry:  Contractors gain peace of mind knowing their sensitive proposal
information is not at risk of unauthorized AI processing or foreign data exposure.
â€¢Why Itâ€™s Not a Burden:  The security requirements apply only to government agencies using
AI for evaluations, not to industry partners submitting proposals.
12 Encouraging Collaboration Between Industry and Government  
The policies explicitly support a collaborative approach between agencies and industry in refining 
AI-assisted evaluations. By requiring AI protest transparency, access to scoring methodologies, 
and human review, industry has a stronger voice in shaping ho w AI is used in federal procurement.  
â€¢How This Helps Industry:  Businesses can engage in policy discussions, influence AI
evaluation processes, and ensure their concerns are addressed before new AI technologies
become widely adopted in federal acquisitions.
â€¢Why Itâ€™s Not a Burden:  Contractors are not required to modify their proposals, adjust
pricing, or take on additional compliance burdens â€”instead, these policies ensure AI usage
enhances fairness, not complicates proposal submissions.
CONCLUSION: A SMART, INDUSTRY -FRIENDLY APPROACH TO AI 
IN FEDERA L PROCUREMENT  
These AI procurement policies are designed to enhance fairness, transparency, and efficiency â€”
without adding regulatory burden or complexity for industry stakeholders. Rather than imposing 
new compliance requirements on businesses, the policies place the re sponsibility squarely on 
federal agencies to ensure that AI is used responsibly.  
By promoting clear evaluation criteria, human oversight, data security, and fair competition, this 
framework protects industry interests while allowing AI to improve the speed and accuracy of 
federal procurement evaluations. These  policies increase trust in AI -assisted procurement, reduce 
bid protests, and ensure that innovation is recognized â€”not overlooked â€”by automated systems.
