General Comment
I'll put this into points:
1) I would like to be able to not be in revenge porn anim ations or other less explicit videos saying or doing anything that can be thought of,
from  endorsing som eone I don't like to saying som ething insanely insensitive, such as slurs, classist, racist, or sexist term inologies, and
otherwise. If som eone can m ake AI "Art" of anything, they can steal your im age of you, real in person you, use an algorithm , and then
m ake you say or do anything they want, from  sex, to defam ation. It is actively horrible and genuinely has already been used against the
president as is.
2) I would like to copy write m y own original works, and not being able to do so because som eone else wants to steal it would be bad.
Im agine, you m ake som ething new, as a sm all level artist, and one random  person in a corporation sees it. suddenly they can just steal the
entire idea and claim  it was random  when it absolutely was not. AI should be a tool to adjust sm all errors, not create everything for you.
Im agine, if som eone wanted to, they could m ake Mickey Mouse say such vulgarity I can't even write it here.
3) The ideas are always so cleaned and sanitized, literally killing creativity so as to prevent people from  getting upset, which m eans you get
no conflict at all. These algorithm s could be trained on anything, and I m ean anything, so they could becom e heavily racist, sexist, or just
outright wrong.
