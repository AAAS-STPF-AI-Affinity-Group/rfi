General Comment
Deregulating AI presents a clear danger to the US people and the econom y. The tech oligarchs m ust not be allowed to develop this
technology without oversight of a governm ent that is not for profit and is tasked specifically to protect its citizens. Regulations are often
referred to as guardrails and exist for safety reasons. We are in uncharted technological areas that can be exploited and used to harm
people.
