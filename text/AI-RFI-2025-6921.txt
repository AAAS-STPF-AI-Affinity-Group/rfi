General Comment
The only way this technology can exist is to steal from  actual artists. AI com panies have 
brazenly ignored copyright laws and fed their m achines with the entire history of hum an art, and will now use that inform ation to undercut
hum an beings. Actual alive artists who m ake living creating art. Itâ€™s in com panies interest to m ake products for as little as possible, and
with this technology it is their hope to do away with having to hire hum an beings at all. Please do allow this illegal and devastating behavior
to be codified into law.
