General Comment
Generative AI should not BE the future of Am erica. If anything, these potential efforts to rem ove corporations like OpenAI accountable
will only further serve to m ake Am erica a laughing stock to m any others. Rem em ber that this country was founded on the basis of
freedom , and what these com panies are doing is the exact opposite of freedom .
