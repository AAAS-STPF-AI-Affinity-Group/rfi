General Comment
I do not believe that AI holds a place in the future of the US. I don't believe that it upholds Am erican values to em brace such a thing
officially. This bill will have disastrous consequences upon copyright if passed, and so to preserve the internet which I use and love, I
believe such a bill should not be adopted.
