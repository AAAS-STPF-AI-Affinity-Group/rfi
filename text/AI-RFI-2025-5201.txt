General Comment
Rem oving restrictions to AI is going to have the opposite effect on national security. Those who know how the tools work will know how
to access the inform ation it is given regardless of where they are in the world - all they will have to do is ask the right questions. It is also
going to devalue hum an contribution across the board and drive the econom y further down than ever - if com panies feel like they no
longer need hum an resources in areas which AI is im plem ented it will put countless Am ericans out of jobs. This is all to say nothing of the
fact that generative AI m odels as they are currently being used rely on theft of intellectual property that their users are failing to cite
properly. All in all this request should not be accepted in any form .
