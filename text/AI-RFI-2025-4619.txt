General Comment
I don't believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States. AI has proven antithetical to the ideals of free expression and creativity,
instead stifling Am erican art, entertainm ent, and education. Further, AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. If
AI cannot function without needing to feed on the creativity of real hum an creators without com pensation, then it nothing m ore than any
overhyped scam .
