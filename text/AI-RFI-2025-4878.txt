General Comment
While I understand AI is not going away, it is absolutely critical we have safeguards in place to protect data privacy and protect the
intellectual and creative property of all of us. AI is built on and profits from  theft. It is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican
public. There is no ethical use of AI; allowing com panies to use it recklessly will only m ake this worse.
