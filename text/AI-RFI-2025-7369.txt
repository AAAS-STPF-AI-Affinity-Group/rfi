General Comment
Generative AI is stealing intellectual property. It is stealing work from  artists. Jobs that would norm ally go to an artist are now going to AI.
This will decim ate creative industries. If people can’t find work, they don’t m ake m oney, and then they can’t buy things, which is bad for
the econom y. This is pretty basic stuff. This will be bad in the short and long term  for the econom y.
