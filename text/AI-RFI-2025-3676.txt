General Comment
Open AI cannot be allowed to flaunt copyright for its m achine. This will utterly destroy all creative industries in the US and prevent new
creative works from  existing as the dom inance of AI takes over these industries. Creative workers will flee the country and seek
protections from  other counties or entities if OpenAI is allowed to train their m achines on all works.
