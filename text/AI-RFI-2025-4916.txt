General Comment
absol utely not, under no circu mstances, shou ld theft of intellectual property be al lowed on the basis of "our busi ness model depends 
on it". If your busi ness model depends on bei ng allowed to steal from others then it's a s&^% business model and shou ld be 
allowed to fail on its own lack of merits. Incidental ly, if that busi ness model depends on bei ng fed a never-endi ng stream of newly-
stolen content then it will fail anyway on the basis of putti ng the creators of that content out of jobs.
