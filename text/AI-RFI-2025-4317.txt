General Comment
I see no future where ai such as this has any positive benefit of the greater world.
Destroying any creative field and filling it unoriginal slop and actively halting the developm ent of children who are inevitably fed this slop
and teaches them  incorrect m orals and ruins them  as they grow up
This type of technology also serves as a tool for lies and m isinform ation. Allowing for people to use any public figure to create a clone to
push lies and spread com m unist propaganda to the am erican people.
If this were to continue, it sets a dangerous precedent on what a com pany can do just for the sake of profit. Dim inishing any am ericans
right to their privacy and their inform ation for the sake of training ai that only helps to benefit com panies.
Turning the Internet into an ai training source, and destroying the Am ericans right to the Internet
