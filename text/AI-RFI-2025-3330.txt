General Comment
This needs not happen. AI is a tool that rem oves agency from  creators and artists while destroying the environm ent and consum ing power
on a m assive scale for the benefits of nobody but the richest people on earth.
Copyrighting m aterial is one of the only ways for artists sm all and large to protect their brands and their livelihoods from  these com panies
who have already been sued for using copyrighted m aterial in the past. This shall not pass.
