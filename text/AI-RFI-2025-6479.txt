General Comment
The fact that we're e ven discussing this is gross a nd insulting. Generative AI is disgusting. It's tra ined on cop yrighted material--art, music, 
writing--that were pa instakingly created by pass ionate independent creators, a nd in turn vomits out infringing slop co ntent. As an 
independent artist, I ab hor AI and everything it stands for. I DO NOT t hink it's fair for my work to be used without my permission and 
without compensation to train software models. AI steals from artists. This is steal ing. A 4 year old can tell you that steal ing is 
wrong. This is basic s&^%.
