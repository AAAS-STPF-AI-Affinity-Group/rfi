General Comment
Hello,
I am  an Am erican artist.
Any AI technology that requires the bypassing of copyright protection to function is stealing from  the livelihood of hard working
Am ericans such as m yself. 
The claim  that AI technology requires stolen content to grow suggests that said AI technology is not sustainable long term . It suggests that
it is an overhyped, over-valued technology that will collapse when it no longer has a continued supply of stolen hum an-m ade content.
Copyright protections should not be softened for any AI technology com pany. Doing so would hurt Am erican workers, creators, and
culture for a technology sector that has yet to prove itself to be profitable, useful, and sustainable.
