General Comment
Allowing LLM and other generative AI technologies to be trained on unlicensed data, without com pensating the actual creators of the
work they profit from , is a travesty. I strongly oppose weakening copyright, tradem ark, or any other rights-holding laws in service to
generative AI. It will discourage actual creatives, drive business out of the US, and overall reduce the potential of new art and artists.
