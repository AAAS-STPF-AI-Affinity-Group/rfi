General Comment
AI is a disaster for our workforce and our standing in the world. If AI is m ade a staple, our children would not be able to com pete with
others throughout the world. Furtherm ore, the creative forces in our nation would be m assively corrupted from  the slop that AI m akes.
No Generative AI!
