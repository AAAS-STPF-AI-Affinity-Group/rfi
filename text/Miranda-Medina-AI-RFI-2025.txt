Hello,
I do not believe AI has a place in the future of the United States, and it is actively profiting off
of theft from tge livelihoods of millions of hardworking, skilled, and honest Americans. I alsobelieve Generative AI like ChatGPT is an insult to our intelligence, compassion, andcreativity, and to the very spirit of what it means to be human. It is clear that in the eyes of theAmerican public, AI is but a fad, fleeting and inconsequential, as corporations push their AIfeatures and settings that no one asked for or enjoys. It only leads to disappointment andboycott of the brand, which means lowering the brand's revenue. That's what brands andcorporations care about, yes? Revenue, sales, and profits? Then stop including AI where itdoes not belong, especially in creative spaces for artists and writers, and any other place wherehuman creativity is an absolute must and is and always will be inherently superior to anunoriginal plagiarizing machine. I am asking you to implement laws to protect these artistsand creatives from plagiarism, theft of their art to train AI without their permission, and loss oftheir essential jobs to AI.
Thank you.
