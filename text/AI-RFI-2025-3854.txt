General Comment
You all didn't learn from  I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream , Robocop, Term inator, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Do Androids Dream  of
Electric Sheep, Blade Runner, Roko's Basilisk, Fallout 4, and so on. You just had to keep pushing for "progress".
AI is the 2nd atom ic bom b and its use and proliferation is not only dangerous to artists and creative m inds, but also to the world. This
needs to stop. Now.
OpenAI, in m y eyes, is a terrorist organization that needs to be investigated and shut down, not enabled by the governm ent to steal other's
work and be spread around for extrem ely dangerous m ilitary applications.
