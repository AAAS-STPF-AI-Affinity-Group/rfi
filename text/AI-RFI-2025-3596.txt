General Comment
No. As a professional artist this would negatively severely im pact m y entire field, and those adjacent, by giving unapproved (by the lawful
copyright holder of their art) individuals, parties, and business, perm ission to use their art without the artist’s perm ission or consent. There
are m uch m ore ethical ways to go about the developm ent of tech. If one m ust strip all consent and ethics in the nam e of so-called
“developm ent” and “innovation” then that is not right by any definition. Copyright theft should not be m ade legal for certain entities.
