General Comment
I do not want artificial intelligence to have free reign and access to the content online without repercussion. Letting it bypass and
circum vent the rules is unfair to all the content creators in this country; allowing AI to scalp their hard work without crediting or
acknowledgm ent is grossly m ishandled. I want this action plan shut down and the idea of AI getting this type of approval not to go
forward.
