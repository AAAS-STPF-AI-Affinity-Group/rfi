General Comment
Artificial Intelligence and its creators should not be allowed to steal from  and profit off of the works of artists, writers, film  m akers,
anim ators, or anyone else. The use of AI to do so goes against all intellectual property laws, and if this request is approved, it sends the
m essage that there is no longer any respect for ownership of work and IP. This would effectively norm alize theft on a grand scale, as if it is
acceptable for AI com panies to steal and violate IP law at this scale, there can be no justification that any individual or com pany cannot
steal from  another.
