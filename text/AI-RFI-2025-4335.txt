General Comment
Do not im plem ent this. It does not, and will not, contribute for the betterm ent of the people of the USA. In fact, AI is one of the leading
negative contributors to our global environm ental and public health. In fact, Han et al. (2025) find that " Our findings reveal that training an
AI m odel of the Llam a-3.1 scale can produce air pollutants equivalent to m ore than 10,000 round trips by car between Los Angeles and
New York City. The total public health burden of U.S. data centers in 2030 is valued at up to m ore than $20 billion per year, double that
of U.S. coal-based steelm aking and com parable to that of on-road em issions of California" (p. 1). Additionally, "the public health costs
unevenly im pact econom ically-disadvantaged com m unities" (p. 1). Another negative im pact of the increased spread and use of AI in the
USA is that it negatively im pacts and affects the distribution of power to both the average Am erican hom e, but also city power grids in
general. As investigated is this Bloom berg article (https://www.bloom berg.com /graphics/2024-ai-power-hom e-appliances/) the increased
stress on local power grids next to highly populated cities leads to m ultiple issues with other necessities in the household, such as
refrigeration and heating. 
Various other facts and bits of inform ation that prove, or at least err on the side of showing that AI is not a sound econom ic investm ent, let
alone a sector worth legal intervention to allow for the use of copyrighted works: 
The United States Census Bureau found that "Only 3.8% of businesses reported using AI to produce goods and services."
(https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/11/businesses-use-ai.htm l) 
MIT Econom ist,Acem oglu reported that AI will im pact less than 5% of hum an tasks in the econom y, m ost of which are office type jobs
that handle things like pattern recognition, which current "AI" is already capable of doing without the need to train on copyrighted bodies
of work. (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-econom ics-091823-025129)
If you prioritize AI over the lives and the stability of your own people, then the m essage the governm ent sends the people is that it wants
to invest in a parasitic technological gam ble with no tangible benefits for anyone. 
And finally a quote that expressed the feelings m any people have about the situation:
"Acem oglu told m e he believed AI is overrated because hum ans are underrated. "So a lot of people in the industry don't recognize how
versatile, talented, m ultifaceted hum an skills and capabilities are," Acem oglu says. "And once you do that, you tend to overrate m achines
ahead of hum ans and underrate the hum ans." (https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-m oney/2024/08/06/g-s1-15245/10-reasons-why-ai-
