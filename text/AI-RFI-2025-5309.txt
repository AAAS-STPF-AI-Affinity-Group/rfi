General Comment
The generic approval for m aterials collection and carte blanche provided to AI com panies is a scourge on the long term  m eaningful
developm ent of m ost any other technology or m aterials.
Allowing things like unrestricted and unapproved collection of our m aterials for training represents considerable harm  to Loam  LLC's
business prospects working in the gam e and software developm ent space, and has and will result in the theft of our m aterials without the
consent of the com pany or any authors. When Loam  uses m usic, m aterials, content, we are required to adhere to m odern copyright laws
and appropriately com pensate third parties for work they do related to our gam es and applications, as outlined by those third parties. This
policy dem onstrates not only is a blatant disregard for the efforts and value put into the products we create, but dam age to the very
m aterials that could be used to im prove AI in the first place if we were consulted and asked to opt in to collection and training. 
Biden-era policies on AI should be m aintained to ensure m eaningful technical developm ents in all spaces, not just a m uted growth only in
AI that crushes other industries, and by extension its own training data. If these AI tools are actually worth the trillions these com panies
allege, surely they can appropriately com pensate and contribute back to the econom y to provide m utual growth without requiring special
treatm ent.
