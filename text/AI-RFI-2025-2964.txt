General Comment
AI is a trend that is being chased off a cliff, and has no future in the U.S. 
Like NFTs or ‘blockchain’ transactions, there is no use for regurgitated work, stolen from  creators, ground up into nonsensical slurry- art
or not. A waste of tim e, energy and resources for an adm inistration claim ing to strive for ‘efficiency.’
