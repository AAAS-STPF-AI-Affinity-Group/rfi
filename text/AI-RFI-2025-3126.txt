General Comment
It is a m atter of public interest, to individuals and sm all businesses, to lim it how generative artificial intelligence can be used. It should not
be legal to replace workers with generating artificial intelligence. This only hurts the Am erican trust in our businesses.
We have seen an increase in businesses replacing Hum an Resources with artificial intelligence, which prevents skilled individuals with
proven m erit from  being able to get jobs.
Fraudulent videos are now readily able to be produced that can falsely depict events that did not happen
To bring back the public trust in our businesses and job m arket, we need to enforce lim its on how com panies can use this technology in
ways that harm  all of us.
