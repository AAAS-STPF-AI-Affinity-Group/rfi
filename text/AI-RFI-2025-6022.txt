General Comment
Usage of AI should be kept to infrastructural purposes only and any usage of it for training AI m odels on visual or literary artwork is
plagiarism . Copyrights have existed far longer than AI and hum an creators deserve to be credited for their work and not becom e
autom ated, because artists of all kinds deserve com pensation for their work.
