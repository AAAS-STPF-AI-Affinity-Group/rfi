General Comment
As an artist, I do not want m y artwork STOLEN by people too lazy to put in the practice and effort or too cheap to pay an artist for their
work, practice and effort. Nor do I want it stolen by those who would capitalize off such people. 
Do NOT let ai steal from  artists and m ake an often difficult livelihood even harder.
