Innovate Boise respectfully submits this response to the Request for Information (RFI) for the 
national AI Action Plan. Our organization operates at the critical intersection of technology 
commercialization, startup development, and regional innovation ecosystem building in Idaho 
and the greater Mountain West region. 
We strongly support the Trump Administration's emphasis on removing barriers to American 
leadership in Artificial Intelligence through Executive Order 14179. Based on our extensive 
experience bridging the gap between research and market-ready AI solutions, we propose 
several concrete policy actions that would strengthen America's AI dominance while fostering 
innovation in regions traditionally underserved by venture capital and technology infrastructure. 
The greatest threat to U.S. AI leadership is not foreign competition but rather domestic barriers 
in the "valley of death" between research and commercialization - particularly in regions outside 
major tech hubs. Our recommendations focus on addressing these critical gaps through 
targeted public-private partnerships and support for regional innovation centers that can 
accelerate the commercialization of AI technologies. Innovate Boise

Key Recommendations 
Pre-Seed Phase Innovation Support Through Innovation Centers 
Problem 
The most significant barrier to American AI leadership is the lack of structured support for 
commercializing promising AI research and technologies in the critical pre-seed phase, 
particularly in regions outside major tech hubs. 
Solution 
Establish a nationwide network of regionally-specific AI innovation centers modeled after 
Innovate Boise's "IP-to-ARR" framework that provides structured pathways for AI technologies 
to move from concept to commercialization. 
Implementation ● Allocate federal funding to establish region-specific innovation centers that focus on 
translating AI research into commercial applications 
● Prioritize regions with strong technical talent but limited venture capital access 
● Implement performance metrics based on commercialization outcomes rather than 
traditional academic metrics 
● Foster public-private partnerships between these centers, local universities, and industry 
AI Workforce Development Through Hands-On Innovation 
Problem 
A significant pool of autodidactic talent is being left behind in the AI revolution. These self-taught 
innovators who have opted for non-traditional learning paths are building and creating some of 
the most advanced technology, yet lack structured support systems to bring their innovations to 
market. 
Solution 
Create "learn by doing" accelerator programs that provide hands-on experience developing and 
commercializing AI technologies, with particular focus on supporting autodidactic talent and 
complementing traditional academic pathways. Innovate Boise

Implementation 
●Fund regional technology accelerators that combine technical education with business
commercialization
●Support the development of AI-focused bootcamps that emphasize skill building through
real-world applications
●Create incentives for businesses to partner with these programs through tax benefits and
matching grants
●Focus on practical, results-oriented education that aligns with market needs
Modernized IP Commercialization Pathways 
Problem 
The process of commercializing AI intellectual property is inefficient and slow 
Solution 
Streamline the pathway from AI research to market through rapid prototyping frameworks and 
aggressive commercialization support. 
Implementation 
●Create new IP fast-track programs specifically for AI technologies
●Establish a network of "AI Commercialization Catalysts" based on principles pioneered
at Skunkworks - small, elite teams with minimal bureaucracy
●Implement agile development methodologies in federal grant programs related to AI
development
●Establish merit-based advancement and lean resource allocation for AI
commercialization initiatives
Non-Dilutive Capital Access for Early-Stage AI Startups 
Problem 
AI startups in and intellectual property developed by young innovators who do not have 
resources and struggle to reach initial revenue and become investable businesses. The 
technology is in-demand and the access needs support.  
Solution Innovate Boise

+


Expand non-dilutive funding programs that help AI startups in the very early phase develop 
go-to-market readiness before seeking outside investment. 
Implementation 
●Create a revenue-first growth model that focuses on helping startups achieve Annual
Recurring Revenue (ARR) before seeking venture capital
●Establish procurement programs that give startups early revenue through government
and corporate partnerships
●Develop pilot program funds for AI startups to test and validate their solutions with real
customers. Include community development and founder-lead network growth
●Create seed capital readiness programs specifically for AI technologies
Recommended Policy Actions 
In our work bridging the Lab-to-Market gap for startups, Innovate Boise has identified several 
policy initiatives that would significantly enhance American AI leadership. 
Support for Industrial Innovation Centers 
Federal Support for Private-Sector AI Commercialization 
We recomm end the federal government provide targeted support to existing and emerging 
private-sector Industrial Innovation Centers focused on AI commercialization. Rather than 
establishing government-run entities, this approach leverages the agility, market 
responsiveness, and entrepreneurial drive of private innovation centers while providing critical 
resources to accelerate commercialization of AI technologies. 
Industrial Innovation Center Framework 
Industrial Innovation Centers like Innovate Boise provide a proven model for bridging the critical 
gap between AI research and commercial applications. These centers serve as: 
●Market-driven commercialization accelerators with structured commercialization
roadmaps
●Community-based innovation hubs connecting entrepreneurs with vetted expertiseInnovate Boise

● Pre-seed development environments where promising AI concepts can be validated and 
refined 
● Regional economic catalysts that foster local technology ecosystems 
 
Recommended Federal Support Mechanisms 
1. Industrial Innovation Center Grant Program 
Establish a competitive grant program specifically for private-sector Industrial Innovation 
Centers with demonstrated capability in AI commercialization. Funding should be tied to 
commercialization outcomes and job creation metrics rather than traditional academic metrics. 
Implementation 
● Allocate appropriate funds through competitive grants to qualified private innovation 
centers 
● Performance-based funding tied to commercialization outcomes and economic impact 
● Five-year support commitments with annual performance evaluations 
● Matching requirements to ensure private sector investment and sustainability 
2. Public-Private Partnership Framework 
Create a formal framework for collaboration between private Industrial Innovation Centers, 
universities, national laboratories, and industry partners to accelerate AI commercialization. 
Implementation 
● Streamlined agreements for technology transfer and IP commercialization 
● Co-development opportunities between private innovation centers and federal research 
entities 
● Technical assistance for emerging innovation centers in undercapitalized regions 
● Prioritization of working with private innovation centers in federal procurement 
3. Regulatory Streamlining for AI Startups 
Reduce regulatory barriers that slow the commercialization of AI technologies through private 
innovation centers. Innovate Boise

Conclusion 
Rather than creating new government entities to manage the education and acceleration of 
technology, supporting existing and emerging private-sector Industrial Innovation Centers 
represents an efficient and effective approach to accelerating AI commercialization. This 
approach harnesses American entrepreneurial spirit and private-sector efficiency while providing 
the critical support needed to ensure U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. 
This proposed model demonstrates that privately-operated Industrial Innovation Centers can 
effectively bridge the critical pre-seed phase where promising AI innovations often falter. With 
targeted federal support, this model can be replicated and scaled across the nation, creating a 
powerful network of commercialization hubs that maintain America's competitive edge in AI. 
Thank you for your support.
