General Comment
I am  an artist and generative steals directly from  m y work and every other artist who has put their pieces out into the world. I fully believe
that allowing this will m ake Am erica worse. Please hear m y plea along with the m ajority of other Am ericans to not let generative ai have
access to copyrighted m aterial. Generative ai has proven to stifle creativity and also wastes m any resources. We have an obligation to
protect our planet, and the people on it.
