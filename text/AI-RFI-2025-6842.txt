General Comment
Ignoring intellectual property rights to allow OpenAI to regurgitate copyrighted m aterial would be the death knell of countless creative
industries. It won't m atter that OpenAI will produce lousy work -- studios, publishers, and corporations in general will happily lay off
entire workforces if they can sim ply instruct an AI to m ake a crappier version for free. People will always create art and literature, but it
will becom e im possible to m ake a living doing it, because anything anyone publishes will be gobbled up and regurgitated by an AI for
som eone else's profit without attribution or com pensation.
In addition to turning our own m ass m edia cultural into com puter-generated slop, this will also further exclude anyone but the
independently wealthy from  being able to devote the kind of tim e it takes to produce great art, literature, or even journalistic reporting.
These things require dedicated tim e and effort, and if there's no hope of a financial return, people working 40+ hours a week will sim ply
not be able to afford to pursue their passions or share them  with the world.
Giving OpenAI free access to copyrighted work would be an unprecedented artistic calam ity. Rather than subm itting to pressure to throw
away intellectual property rights, we should com m it to em bargoing for-profit work from  overseas AIs that violate our copyright, and
protect the invaluable cultural contributions m ade by writers, artists, scholars, film m akers, and journalists both here in the US and abroad.
