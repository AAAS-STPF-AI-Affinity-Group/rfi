General Comment
The function of copyright is to facilitate the creation of creative works by giving artists rights to control how their work is used or
distributed. There are exceptions given for satire, journalism , critique, and whether it com petes with the original work. If som eone wants
to use a work outside of these exceptions they can enter an agreem ent with the artist for paym ent or license. This is how IP has worked
for over a century.
It is utterly absurd, unjust, and deleterious to the landscape of creative works to allow AI com panies to copy this vast am ount of data and
then sell its product back into the sam e m arket to com pete with the sam e works they stole from  
AI training on copyrighted data m ust not be allowed, end of story.
