General Comment
Do not let these AI com panies destroy Am erica's copyright and creative soft power dom inance. To do so would be like destroying patent

us weak. I'm  seeking a result and voting for those who align with an Am erica strong approach, which m eans a lot m ore than just m aking a
sm all handful of AI com panies rich.
