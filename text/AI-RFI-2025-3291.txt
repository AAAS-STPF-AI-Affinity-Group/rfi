General Comment
I will say m y beliefs on AI as a whole and this act in particular as concisely as I can.
* Rem oving copyright protections for the sake of AI's advancem ent will cause m ore harm  than good.
* Making AI easier to develop instead of harder m ay enable bad actors seeking to use AI to create and/or exacerbate national security
concerns.
* AI profits off of and steals the hard work of real people which will only worsen the recession we are headed towards at our current
trajectory.
* The governm ent needs to be regulating and governing the use of AI, not letting it ignore regulations and governance without
consequences.
