General Comment
The 'AI' (Large Language Models) these com panies are trying to sell us isn't 'intelligent'. It's a chatbot that, at best, can sum m arize things
accurately about half the tim e. At worst it's used by police and governm ent to 'identify' and terrorize innocent people. These LLMs have
very little place in a governm ent of the People, by the People, and for the People. We have tried and tested com puter technologies that
we've been using for decades, that don't purposefully lie to us. And when these legacy system s do fail we can audit the code to find out
why.
