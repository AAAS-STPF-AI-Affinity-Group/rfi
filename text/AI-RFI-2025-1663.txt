General Comment
ART SHOULD NEVER BE AUTOMATED. Gen AI sucks the soul out of art. Paintings, Photography, film , m usic. All of is a deep
com m unication between hum ans. It can display shared experiences we all go through, or give a perspective that the viewer/listener has
never thought of. And the laboring process that artist go through to create is not a nusance that should be replaced by the click of button.
The skill and labor breaths life into it, and any creator worth their salt would agree. DO NOT ROB ART OF THE SOUL AND
PASSION CREATORS PUT INTO IT. Autom ation by a m achine does that very thing. And if you do that then there isnâ€™t a point. Life is
bankrupt of intrigue, joy, and creativity in a world like that.
