General Comment
AI is actively plagiarizing artists and writers and putting people out of jobs so a m achine can spit out garbage that a real person needs to
put in work to correct. Tech com panies are desperately shoving it down everybody's throats despite it being so obviously flawed because
they invested so m uch in it and don't want to accept that it's not panning out. It also uses up a ridiculous am ount of energy just to cause
problem s. It absolutely is not a replacem ent for real hum an work and attention and it's sham eful that the governm ent is bowing down to
the pressure from  self-im portant tech CEOs to rely on it.
