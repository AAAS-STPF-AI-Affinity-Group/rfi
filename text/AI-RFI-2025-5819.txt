General Comment
AI is built upon a database stolen from  people's work and personal inform ation who did not give perm ission to use as com panies profit off
their data. AI effectively steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
AI m ust be held accountable for spreading bias and m isinform ation. Relying on AI to do a job m akes workers less skilled, and
corporations that consolidate their workforce to rely on AI are inherently anti-labor. If you want to keep jobs in the United States, AI
needs to be regulated so it doesn't endanger the Am erican people.
