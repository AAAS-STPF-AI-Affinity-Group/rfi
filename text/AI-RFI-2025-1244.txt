General Comment
A.I. is destroying our natural environm ent and resources. Specifically, water and electricity production in the long and short term . It’s bad
enough that Trum p doesn’t believe in Clim ate Change. He’s further burdening citizens with his dem and for A.I. A product that routinely
lies, produces no original output, and uses a Lake’s worth of water for every interaction to cool the m ultitude of com puters that power it!
Life isn’t the Jetsons or the Matrix. A.I. is functionally useless right now and a net negative for society. In a tim e of clim ate collapse the last
thing we need is to em brace A.I. just because everyone dream s of getting m oney for nothing.
