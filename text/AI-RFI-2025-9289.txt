RE: Com m ents on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
Dear Mr. D’Souza, 
Thank you for the opportunity to review and com m ent on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan directed by
Presidential Executive Order 14179. First and forem ost, Scott County supports the developm ent of a clear plan for guiding AI’s
significant potential to increase the efficiency and efficacy of governm ent services. As the local entity tasked with delivering program s and
services m andated at the state and federal level, we have a deep understanding of the challenges posed by the com plexity of these
system s, which also gives us a clear perspective on the opportunities for innovation and efficiency. 
As the level of governm ent closest to the people, counties play a critical role in delivering essential services that range from  social
program s and public safety to infrastructure and em ergency response. AI presents a truly transform ational opportunity for all levels of
governm ent to work together to enhance service delivery, stream line operations, and m ake data-driven decisions that directly im pact
residents' daily lives. By leveraging AI to integrate data across departm ents—such as linking social services with public safety to identify
at-risk individuals or using predictive analytics for infrastructure m aintenance—counties can create m ore efficient, responsive, and cost-
effective program s. However, AI deploym ent m ust be guided by principles of transparency and accountability. Counties need clear
governance fram eworks to ensure AI protect sensitive data and m aintaining public trust.
Counties also bring a unique perspective to AI im plem entation, as they m ust navigate com plex funding structures, intergovernm ental
partnerships, and m yriad com m unity needs. Workforce training, responsible procurem ent, and stringent data privacy protections m ust be
prioritized to ensure AI benefits all residents equitably. Additionally, policies should support counties in responsibly integrating AI into
existing program s while safeguarding against risks such as cybersecurity threats and algorithm ic discrim ination. 
We appreciate the opportunity to subm it these com m ents, and we hope you will give them  consideration in your efforts to develop an AI
Action Plan that encourages innovation and efficiency across all levels of governm ent. 
Respectfully, 
Lezlie Verm illion

RE: Comments on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action 
Plan
Dear Mr. D’Souza, 
Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) Action Plan directed by Presidential Executive Order 14179. First and foremost, Scott County 
supports the development of a clear plan for guiding AI’s significant potential to increase the efficiency 
and efficacy of government services. As the local entity tasked with delivering programs and services 
mandated at the state and federal level, we have a deep understanding of the challenges posed by the 
complexity of these systems, which also gives us a clear perspective on the opportunities for innovation 
and efficiency. 
As the level of government closest to the people, counties play a critical role in delivering essential 
services that range from social programs and public safety to infrastructure and emergency response. AI 
presents a truly transformational opportunity for all levels of government to work together to enhance 
service delivery, streamline operations, and make data-driven decisions that directly impact residents' 
daily lives. By leveraging AI to integrate data across departments—such as linking social services with 
public safety to identify at-risk individuals or using predictive analytics for infrastructure maintenance—
counties can create more efficient, responsive, and cost-effective programs. However, AI deployment 
must be guided by principles of transparency and accountability. Counties need clear governance 
frameworks to ensure AI protect sensitive data and maintaining public trust.
Counties also bring a unique perspective to AI implementation, as they must navigate complex funding 
structures, intergovernmental partnerships, and myriad community needs. Workforce training, responsible 
procurement, and stringent data privacy protections must be prioritized to ensure AI benefits all residents 
equitably. Additionally, policies should support counties in responsibly integrating AI into existing 
programs while safeguarding against risks such as cybersecurity threats and algorithmic discrimination. 
We appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments, and we hope you will give them consideration 
in your efforts to develop an AI Action Plan that encourages innovation and efficiency across all levels of 
government. 
Respectfully, 
Lezlie Vermillion
Scott County Administrator
