General Comment
AI is not art. It does not generate content out of nothing. It is trained to copy the style of a writer, artist, or other entity to provide what it
"creates". This is tantam ount to m aking it legal for AI to com m it plagiarism . I would urge the governm ent to reject that possibility and err
on the side of protecting creators' rights and copyrights.
