[External] “AI Action Plan"
Wednesday, February 26, 2025 1:45:49 PM
Dear  Faisal D’Souza,
I am a 17-year-old teenager and a Senior in a Public High School in California.
I think AI is a great tool but not everyone understands it or know how to use it as just as tool  
instead of a way to get answers or get your homework done. 
I think Teachers and Students should be educated on what AI is and learn how to use it safely  
where it doesn't hurt our learning. Or tempt us to take short cuts. 
We realize its here and it should level out the gaps in education.
