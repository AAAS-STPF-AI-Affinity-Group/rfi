General Comment
Em bracing AI m eans a loss of jobs for everyday Am ericans. Executives will look to cut costs, firing em ployees and replacing them  with a
non reliable AI.
AI should be utilized to m ake everyday Am ericans lives easier, not take their jobs.
DO NOT let silicon valley destroy the working class. Reject any plans to use AI.
