General Comment
First; if a so-called service needs to scrape other creative people’s work without due com pensation or recognition; then it is theft, pure &
sim ple. Second; if your entire business m odel consists of exploiting the work of others to provide nothing in return; then you are not a
business; you are a parasite that causes m ore harm  than good; and third; nobody is asking for this tech except greedy & lazy people who
don’t want to think/create/ or develop ideas them selves.
