General Comment
Not only is AI a grift, but it’s destroying creative industries not only in the USA but globally. Am  I expected to believe that copyright held
in countries that are not the USA are going to be filtered through and upheld? If your business m odel requires literal theft for viability, then
it’s a bad business m odel, AND your product doesn’t even work. Absolutely vile behaviour. Em barrassing.
