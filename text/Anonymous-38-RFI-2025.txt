I commend the Administration’s commitment to sustaining and enhancing America’s global 
leadership in AI technology innovation, as well as its invitation for public participation in 
shaping this critical policy framework. Below, I offer my perspective on bo th positive aspects 
and potential worrisome issues that should be considered as the AI Action Plan takes shape. 
Positive Issues: Focus on Innovation and Competitiveness: The emphasis on preventing 
“unnecessarily burdensome requirements” from hindering priv ate sector innovation is a 
promising approach. By fostering an environment where companies can experiment and scale AI 
solutions, the U.S. can maintain its edge over global competitors, particularly in fast -evolving 
fields like machine learning and generat ive AI. This deregulatory stance could accelerate 
breakthroughs that enhance economic competitiveness and national security. Public Engagement: 
The decision to solicit broad input from academia, industry, and government entities is a strength 
of this proce ss. Incorporating diverse perspectives can ensure the AI Action Plan reflects 
practical, forward -thinking policies that balance innovation with societal needs, ultimately 
promoting human flourishing as outlined in the Executive Order. Global Leadership: Pr ioritizing 
America’s position as an AI powerhouse is a strategic move in an era where nations like China 
are heavily investing in AI. A robust plan could secure U.S. dominance in key areas such as AI 
hardware, data infrastructure, and talent development, w hich are foundational to long -term 
technological superiority. Worrisome Issues: Risk of Insufficient Oversight: While reducing 
regulatory barriers is beneficial for innovation, an overly hands -off approach could lead to 
unintended consequences. Without cle ar guidelines on ethical AI deployment, issues such as bias 
in AI systems, privacy violations, or misuse in sensitive sectors (e.g., healthcare or defense) 
might undermine public trust and safety. I urge the Action Plan to include lightweight, principle -
based safeguards that protect against these risks without stifling progress. Workforce 
Displacement Concerns: The drive for AI dominance could accelerate automation, potentially 
displacing workers in industries like manufacturing or services. The Plan should  consider 
proactive measures —such as workforce retraining programs or incentives for AI -human 
collaboration —to ensure economic competitiveness benefits all Americans, not just a tech elite. 
International Collaboration vs. Competition: The focus on U.S. dom inance is understandable, but 
it risks alienating allies who could be partners in advancing responsible AI. A purely competitive 
stance might hinder global cooperation on shared challenges like AI safety standards or climate 
modeling. I suggest the Plan ex plore avenues for selective collaboration with like -minded 
nations to amplify U.S. leadership while addressing transnational AI issues. Recommendations: 
To maximize the AI Action Plan’s impact, I recommend prioritizing policies that: Support 
innovation thr ough targeted investments in AI research, infrastructure (e.g., data centers), and 
education, ensuring the U.S. has the talent and tools to lead. Establish a flexible framework for 
ethical AI use, drawing on private sector best practices rather than heavy -handed regulation, to 
maintain public confidence. Address workforce transitions by incentivizing companies to 
integrate AI in ways that augment, rather than replace, human labor. The Trump 
Administration’s vision for AI leadership is bold and necessary. By  balancing innovation with 
thoughtful risk management, the AI Action Plan can secure America’s place at the forefront of 
this transformative technology while delivering broad societal benefits.
