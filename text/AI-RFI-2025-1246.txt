General Comment
The use of “Artificial Intelligence” (AI, LLM, etc.) will increase errors in evaluations, im pede and destroy processes, and decim ate the
federal governm ent. Evidence of AI’s failure is being reported everywhere so either this adm inistration is too foolish or in denial about the
harm s such tools pose to com plex governm ent processes. Every evaluation of federal agencies and departm ents has m ade note of the
actual solution for governm ent efficiency: adequate staffing, docum entation, and com plem entary, not supplanting, technology for sim ple
and repetitive processes. Supplanting technology, such as AI, cannot fix these issues and in fact will exacerbate them  as poor data
produces poor results. Ditch the m achine learning and properly staff agencies and departm ents for truly effective and efficient
adm inistration of governm ent program s and projects.
