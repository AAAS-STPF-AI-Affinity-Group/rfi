To Whome It May Concern,
Artificial Intelegence (AI) is destroying everything it touches.  It steals the work and lives of  
the American people and allows corporations or anyone else to profit off of something  
someone else did. 
Things created with AI are souless copies of a copy.  The AI Google search engines have  
contributed to mass misinformation and the s $%^ification of daily life. I have been told  
incorrect information about medication I'm on and health conditions. It can be extremly  
devistating.
A computer can't do things that a Human can.  A computer lacks Humanity and an awareness  
to live in the physical world that we do.
AI should be Banned as it is destroying evrything it touches. Amazon has announced AI on it's  
Alexa and I will be discontinuing use because of this. I have stopped any servie that has opted  
to use AI.
Sincerly, 
William Siefferman
