General Comment
I am  horrified by the Am erican governm ent's AI action plan, as it will undercut and harm  the very Am erican workers the governm ent
purports to protect. We are already seeing the effects of AI replacing workers and creating m assive job cuts, and if AI is allowed to
proliferate unabated, the effects on our job force and econom y will be disastrous. As it stands, our country is already ill-equipped to
handle rising levels of unem ploym ent, and the unm itigated growth of AI will only exacerbate this problem .
To say the least of AI's blatant breach of copyright law, as our current large-language m odels are not truly "intelligent," but a pattern
recognition m achine built on the stolen words and artwork of hundreds of thousands (if not m illions) of hardworking Am ericans, none of
whom  have been com pensated for the use of their work without perm ission. If this is allowed to continue, this will only harm  sm all
businesses and creative entrepreneurs, on which the entire bedrock of this country has been built.
AI, like m any other ill-conceived tech ventures, is a bubble that will burst with resounding negative effects on the Am erican econom y. We
m ust put regulations and stopgaps on AI now before it is allowed to destroy our futures.
