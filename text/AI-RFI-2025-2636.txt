General Comment
I do NOT approve of the ability for com panies to bypass copyright rules for the sake of AI training. It is a violation of privacy and a
waste of governm ent effort to approve of this. AI has no place in the grand schem e of things and is purely just hype for a sm all group of
basem ent dwellers to flex their com puter skills to take peopleâ€™s privacy and jobs away.
