General Comment
I do not want either the federal governm ent or any state or local governm ent involved in anything to do with "artificial intelligence" at all. All
that "AI" is being used for is to steal the work of artists, m ost of whom  are extrem ely underpaid for their work, so that corporations can
layoff tons of people and m ake even m ore m oney then they already m ake. The working class of the United States need free healthcare, a
higher m inim um  wage, basic incom e, free housing, and so m uch m ore. It is a total waste of tim e and m oney to be even considering an "AI"
Action Plan. Focus your efforts on m ore im portant things that m atter to the vast m ajority of Am ericans instead of this nonsense!
