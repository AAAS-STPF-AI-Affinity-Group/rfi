General Comment
May I hum bly use this opportunity to express m y passion and desire to be part of the team  of key players in the new President Trum p's
executive order on the developm ent of AI in Am erica and around the world .
Artificial intelligence program m ing and developm ent will go a long way in finding solutions to m any problem s all over the world .
May I hum bly request that the developm ent of AI should be m ade a little open to people around the world for their input .
Areas to explore are m any and m ajor player should not lim it their request for public input from  only people in Am erican soil .
Their are people in Africa who can m ake a reasonable contribution to the project .
Please rem em ber Am erica is the watchdog of the world .
Now for m e I am  in Africa (Nigeria) we have som ething to offer as a part of our contribution for the developm ent of the project .
No one is om niscient to knowledge .
Can I be invited to be part of the expanding of project for som ething good can com e out from  Africa.
Thanks 
Orji Cletus C
