General Comment
There is no "AI Dom inance" because m ost people don't even understand what AI is in the first place. It has som e prom ise as a TOOL for
people to use but Generative AI has already earned a reputation of being cheap and untrustworthy, frankly because it is. It's m ostly been
used to trick and take advantage of others all across the internet and the globe. It has no place in ANY part of our governm ent and should
not be given any special treatm ent whatsoever. If anything there should be MORE restrictions against it.
