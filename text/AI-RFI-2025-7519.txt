General Comment
AI is a dead end. Its only skill is regurgitating what is in the past, and it does that poorly. It's sugar coated lies and it causes harm .
It will not im prove the average Am erican's life, and instead steals from  their carefully fostered skills to create som ething subpar. Do not
allow it to steal m ore easily. Do not allow openAI and others to use the labor of m any to bring profit to few. AI will not help bring food to
tables or wellbeing to a soul.
