General Comment
Com panies training AI already do not respect the privacy of users nor copyright infringem ent when crawling the web for datasets. We
should be putting m ore regulations on the use of user data, not m aking it easier. I don't want m y writing, m y art, m y likeness to be used as
training data. We should be exercising our concern about the Chinese governm ent hoovering up Am ericans' sensitive inform ation on
hom egrown industries as well - there's no reason for a double standard. It's creepy if a foreign governm ent has this m uch inform ation
about m e. It's just as creepy if OpenAI does too. Privacy is a basic hum an right and is one we should be careful to balance with the near
necessity of being online in the m odern world. Please don't rem ove even m ore guardrails on this.
