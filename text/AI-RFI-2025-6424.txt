General Comment
I am  very m uch against generative AI having access to copyrighted work, doing so would m ake the livelihoods of workers in creative
fields m uch m ore difficult, especially if said workers are not going to be com pensated for the theft required to train these m odels. I do not
believe that AI has a worthwhile role in the future of this country, and I also do not believe that this is som ething the Am erican public really
wants or needs.
