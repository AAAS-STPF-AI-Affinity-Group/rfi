General Comment
The ram pant theft, energy guzzling, and spread of m isinform ation that AI already poses vastly outweigh the need for Am erican superiority.
This is a useful tool but an extrem ely dangerous one, and letting it snowball with even less regulation than it already gets is a clear
adm ission that those proposing this bill care m ore about tech profits than the people in this country.
