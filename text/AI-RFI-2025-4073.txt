General Comment
AI does NOT hold any value for us in Am erica. It is a business built upon stealing from  others, and the Am erican people deserve better.
To invest in AI is to dism iss the livelihoods of thousands of Am ericans, and throw their creations of passion and love up to the highest
bidder. All to fuel som ething that spits in the face of creativity and hard work. AI holds no future in our country. Period.
