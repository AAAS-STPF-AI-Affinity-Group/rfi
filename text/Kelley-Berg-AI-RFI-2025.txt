To Whom it May Concern:
I am a private citizen. I am deeply concerned that this Action Plan calls for removingessentially all guardrails - what is referred to as "unnecessarily burdensome requirements"- inthe development and deployment of AI.
  Virtually unregulated AI allows for worst case
scenarios and rampant abuse and misuse of data and metadata. Additionally, everything thatanyone creates that is within reach of AI will be fair game for appropriation withoutcompensation, regardless of copyright laws. The power of AI is immense and will only grow. Lack of best practices and reasonableregulation invites abuse that can have disastrous impacts on individuals and entities. I urgeyou to proceed with caution. America can be a leader in this field AND do so ethically andsafely. It is the government's responsibility to make sure we do so.
