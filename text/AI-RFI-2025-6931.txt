General Comment
Absolutely cover AI by all regulation possible. Scraping public content to generate new things is theft. 
Original works need to be protected from  AI scraping and use. We need to stop devaluing the work of people for the enrichm ent of
m odel owning corporations. Art is hum an, not m achine.
