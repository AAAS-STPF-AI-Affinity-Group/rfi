General Comment
Stop building it. Literally just stop. This is deeply unacceptable. AI com panies want to put us all on the street while they risk all of our lives
in their pursuit of ASI god to let them  rule the world forever. You m ust pursue an international treaty to pause advanced AI developm ent
until we can guarantee with global consensus that we can m ake truly ethical AI. Otherwise, you are com plicit in the worst act hum anity has
ever taken.
