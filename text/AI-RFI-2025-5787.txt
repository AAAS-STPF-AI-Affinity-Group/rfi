General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. Studies by AI com panies such as Microsoft show it harm s workers and children.
It steals from  Am erican's livelihood, and often violates HIPAA and other regulations for Personal Inform ation. Guardrails on its
developm ent, and especially regulation from  a security perspective are extrem ely im portant, and throwing open the gates is the opposite of
what should be done.
