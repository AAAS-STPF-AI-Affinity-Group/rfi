General Comment
As a creative person and som eone who cares about the welfare of those with careers in creative industries, it is absolutely abhorrent that
the governm ent is even considering m aking it legal for corporations to train their AI on creative m aterial that is outside the realm  of open
license. This is a thinly veiled attem pt to cut corners and use AI to turn a profit, plain and sim ple. Not only is it a blatant violation of
intellectual property and copyright law, it's a violation of m oral and ethical practices in creative industries where hum an creation IS the
backbone of the industry. Generative AI is plagiarism  wrapped in the guise of "innovation." Trum p and the Republican adm inistration are
being paid out by corporations with billions of dollars in revenue to throw at this issue so that they can get their hands on ideas and
m aterials without having to spend any of that m oney at the creators who cam e up with them . They are asking to m ake theft legal. I im plore
you, please see sense and listen to the industry leaders who have and continue to provide evidence that allowing AI com panies
unm itigated access to people's intellectual property is a terrible idea and will lead m any industries to a com plete collapse and result in real
econom ic and individual devastation.
