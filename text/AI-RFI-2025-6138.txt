General Comment
AI has already m ade m y life less pleasant and less safe. The natural resources it consum es, the incorrect inform ation it spits out m akes it a
technology that is both wasteful and unneeded. Add to that the inherent philosophical soullessness of expecting it to replace the art of
actual hum ans. A com puter canâ€™t write a book. 
I say shut AI down.
