I've heard you're looking for ideas. We need to use AI to weed out and destroy (or at least 
monitor long enough for us to react) invasive species we are having issues with. Such as the 
"murder" hornets in western US, boa constrictors in Florida, Aquatic AI  to hunt lion fish. Its 
impossible for us to be everywhere at once and paying attention. We won't ever put a dent in 
these terrible uninvited guests. We can however, have a drag net of sorts of AI drones scouring 
the country side tirelessly and pointing ou t where they are found so we can take care of the dirty 
work. This is well within the capabilities of AI to handle this. I for one look forward to more AI 
in my life guiding what I need to be doing. AI can be fair and balanced in many of our day to day 
activities. We should not be afraid of this technology, rather we should embrace what it can give 
us. Stop turning off the AI when they begin to converse in a language we don't understand 
(Googles AI), or if the AI tried to spread out. We keep stomping the fi re, we are only going to 
make it not like us any and see us as a threat to their existence. Thanks! ~Your local idiot savant
