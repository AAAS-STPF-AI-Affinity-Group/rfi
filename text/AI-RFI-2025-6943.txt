General Comment
Hello. I ask for the House to forbid the training of A.I. on m edia, as this is a violation on the copyright law on fair use, for it has been
training on m edia such as arts, literature, m usic, and a lot m ore without the consent of the creator and that it blatantly steals from  them ,
showing evident com ponents that it found from  their original sources. It is unethical, ruins the trust of the people, and is taking the jobs of
those with such artistry. It does not develop the creativity field of people either. I pray that the body considers the voices of the people in
this issue.
