General Comment
The attem pt to give "OpenAI" im m unity from  lawsuits nor without proper com pensation will prove further detrim ental to the United States
and thus worsen the ties with allies abroad. This has no jurisdiction to m ost governing bodies outside of the United States, even if
"OpenAI" is within the confines of the World Wide Web it isn't subject to such im m unities. Eventually the United States will only have its
new "allies" to com m unicate with after their old allies leave them  in the dark. There'll never be such a thing as AI "art", only theft and
am algam ation of other's art. Your governm ent will be held responsible by its people and old allies in the end and even m erciful that said
governm ent isn't forced to com pensate the artists of its country for the dam ages already inflicted. However, in the end it SHOULD be the
result for even considering such absentm inded industrialization of OUR work, it's not yours to take.
