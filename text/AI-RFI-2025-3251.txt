General Comment
This is obscene and absurd, basically giving AI com panies the right to steal en m asse. If I were to go and steal copyrights from  Disney, Iâ€™d
be buried in lawsuits within m inutes. So what m akes them  so special that they can com pletely circum vent copyright? It basically renders
the entire system  of copyright useless. The whole point is to protect people from  ip theft, and such a system  is essentially green lighting that
theft. May as well do away with the entire system  then.
