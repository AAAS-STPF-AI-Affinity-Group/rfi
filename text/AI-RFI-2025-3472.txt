General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US as AI profits off of theft. Copyright is a protection that protects those that create
works as a hobby, sm all business, all the way up to large cooperation. AI takes opportunity away from  Am ericans
AI also dam ages the livelihood of m any Am ericans - slowly rem oving creative jobs from  the workforce and dam aging sm all businesses.
An artist can not m ake their living and contribute to culture and society when they are so freely being stolen from  by developers that do
not have their best interest in m ind. 
On top of the protection copyright provides, it also brings into question the safety and ethics of these program s. If AI developers can not
properly source content that is legal for them  to use, how are we as Am ericans suppose to trust that it will filter in relevant and helpful
inform ation. This can create concerns for national security - the governm ent already seem s to think that there is a concern that outside
sources feed false inform ation to Am ericans, I can very m uch see AI such as ChatGPT and Google AI search results feeding into that
m isinform ation m achine that can harm  us as a society. 
AI in its current form  is not helpful to the Am erican people. If it is not helpful with guardrails in place, we the people can not trust it without
those protections and m ore.
