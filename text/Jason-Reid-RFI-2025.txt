Dear Members of the AI Policy Formulation Team,  
I am writing to you today not as a representative of any organization but as a concerned citizen 
deeply invested in the ethical development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
technologies. My intent is to contribute personal insights that I hop e will be valuable in shaping 
policies to enhance America's leadership in AI, particularly within the healthcare sector, while 
addressing cybersecurity, public safety, energy efficiency, and environmental sustainability.  
Ethical Implementation of AI in Healthcare : Healthcare is a domain where AI can have profound 
impacts. It is vital to ensure these technologies are developed and used responsibly —upholding 
privacy laws, maintaining unbiased algorithms, and providing transparency in decision -making 
processes that i nstill trust among patients and medical providers.  
Cybersecurity Vigilance : As we integrate AI into our healthcare infrastructure, we must prioritize 
world -class cybersecurity measures. Protecting sensitive health data against cyber threats is 
imperative; patient confidentiality and system integrity are paramount.  
Transparent Breach Protocols : In the event of data leaks or breaches, it is essential to have 
established protocols for informing the public with clarity and promptness. These protocols should 
detail what occurred, the extent of the breach, actions taken to secure systems thereafter,  and advice 
on how individuals can safeguard their information from potential misuse.  
Comprehensive Post -Breach Support : Support mechanisms for those affected by data breaches 
must be robust. Offering identity protection services at no cost and providing helplines staffed with 
trained professionals ready to address individual concerns are key components that should be 
included in our national plan.  
Energy Efficiency in AI Systems : I also wish to underscore the critical issue of energy consumption 
associated with the operation of AI systems. It is essential that we pursue a strategy that not only 
advances technological prowess but also safeguards environmental integrity.  
• Incentivize Energy -Efficient AI Research : We should encourage and allocate funding 
towards research into innovative methods and technologies designed to minimize the energy 
footprint of AI systems without compromising their effectiveness.  
• Adopt Best Practices for Energy Efficiency : It is important to promote the widespread 
adoption of best practices in energy -efficient computing throughout the industry. This 
includes optimizing data centers and cloud services for better energy utilization.  
• Evaluate and Implement Green Technologies : Wherever feasible, we must assess and 
integrate green technologies, such as renewable energy sources, to power data centers which 
form the backbone of our AI infrastructure.  


2 •Establish Benchmarks for Energy Consumption : Transparent benchmarks should be
developed to measure and report on the energy consumption of various AI applications. This
will enhance accountability among developers and users alike.
•Include Energy Considerations in Regulatory Frameworks : Any regulatory frameworks
that govern AI development must incorporate considerations regarding energy usage. This
will ensure that our pursuit of technological advancement does not come at an undue cost to
our environment.
By setting benchmarks for measuring AI's energy consumption and integrating these considerations 
into regulatory frameworks around AI development, we can ensure technological advancements do 
not come at an unsustainable environmental cost.  
In conclusion, I believe that an action plan which encompasses these suggestions —ethical use within 
healthcare settings; stringent cybersecurity measures; transparent breach notification procedures; 
post-breach support; along with rigorous standards for en ergy usage —will lead us towards a future 
where AI serves America’s interests securely and sustainably.  
Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this vital issue affecting our nation’s 
future with artificial intelligence. I am hopeful that inputs from various walks of life will culminate in 
an action plan reflective of America's diverse va lues and aspirations.  
Sincerely,  
Jason A. Reid , RN
