General Comment
If AI com panies are allowed to sim ply defy the laws of copyright because it's part of their business m odel, then that m eans that there's no
reason for copyright law to exist in the first place. Just because people are deciding they can m ake m oney off of som ething does not m ean
they should be allowed to break laws to do so. AI generation of words and im ages are harm ful to the people and detrim ental to the
overall hum an spirit.
