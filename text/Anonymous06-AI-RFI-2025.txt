Having give a read on both the Plan and the circumstances it was released in, it comes off as
underhanded. While the use of AI has been heavily contested, with many examples both forand against its use in media. Trying to pass this law with the intent of never allowing theopposite side to have a chance to voice against it can come off as criminal in this society.
Anything having to do with AI, especially in business that can and will throw away workers
for a quick buck, needs both sides present to pass laws like this. Trying to pass this law whilethere are concerns of business wanting to make the shortest path to money and throwingworkers under the bus is not the right move. Plans like these need more oversight, if not moredevelopment to prevent abuse by companies wanting to use it to fill their pockets with extracash.
