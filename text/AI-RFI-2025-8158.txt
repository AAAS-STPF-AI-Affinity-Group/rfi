General Comment
AI m odels should not be developed on copyrighted m aterial. It's theft. It's not "learning" like a hum an learns from  practicing painting,
drawing, com posing m usic, writing. AI is program m ed from  stolen work, trained to recognize patterns based on an im possibly huge
collection of existing, copyrighted m aterial. The advances in generative AI are already taking away jobs that used to exist for people who
paid tens of thousands of dollars to specialize in creative fields. It is cruel and anti-hum an. It's against our very lives. If we had universal
basic incom e for everyone, this aspect of m achine learning would not sting as m uch. But it is stealing our work and literally taking our jobs.
Is this the future we want?
