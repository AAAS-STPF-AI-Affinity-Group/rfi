General Comment
I am  a professional artist who is appalled by the ram pant theft and dishonesty displayed by these so-called AI com panies. Their tools
cannot be created without intellectual property theft and should therefore not exist.
If I dem anded access to Disney's copyrighted work as an independent artist, with the claim  that I cannot m ake a profit without it, that
request would be ludicrous on its face and denied without question. Why should the claim  of a m ulti-billion dollar corporation that they
cannot m ake a profit without access to m y copyrighted work be any different?
Any carve-out of copyright protection for these scam  artists should and can not be considered. If we do so, in future decades we will find
that the new leaders of the world are those that did not cater to the fantasies of AI prom oters.
