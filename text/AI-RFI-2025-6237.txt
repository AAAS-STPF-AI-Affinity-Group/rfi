General Comment
I don't believe that AI m odels like OpenAI have any place in the future of this country, and actively harm s the livelihoods of m any
Am ericans through theft, and the encouragem ent of laying off workers to try and cut costs through the use of an inferior product that isn't
popular, which in turn further harm s our econom y.
