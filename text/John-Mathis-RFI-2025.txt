As more companies turn to AI to generate product and services, they are collecting greater 
amounts of data that has inherent value. However, this is not tracked in any way. I propose that, 
as data is actually a financial asset, that companies that use AI h ave to inventory, track, value and 
protect their data assets, especially as it comes to profiles of U.S. citizens. This data asset 
generates real income when used as a part of AI - and as such, should be taxed to support the 
U.S. government. This data asse t, like any U.S. natural resource, is being collected across our 
citizens, and should be used to benefit the U.S.
