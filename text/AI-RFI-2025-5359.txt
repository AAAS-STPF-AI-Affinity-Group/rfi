General Comment
I do not believe unregulated AI is safe for Am erica. AI com panies profit off of stolen inform ation, any norm al person would be prosecuted
for far less copyright infringem ent than AI com panies. Not only that, AI is a wasteful use of energy that is draining valuable electricity and
water.
