General Comment
There shouldnt be further developm ent on Ai. It was built with data without the consent of the people that provided that data. It is a huge
copyright issue that people have tried to fight against. 
Ai also has a huge negative im pact on the clim ate and artist. It takes away jobs for so m any people and it is the governm ent's job to
provide jobs to their people. It used a lot of energy just to create one im age and even if that is im proved on, the planet is dying already.
Leave it alone.
Om  top of that ai has been used to create negative, sexual and frankly disgusting im ages of m any people. Deep fakes of non consenting
people am ong other things.
