General Comment
I can see the value of AI in fields such as m edicine, but it seem s to m e that this plan calls for the unfettered use of any and all copyrighted
works for AI generation. This to m e does not seem  like a way to im prove the lives of Am ericans, but rather it would be a sanctioned
robbery of their hard work. Com panies have fought hard to m aintain copyright for a reason. One's creative output, their creativity identity,
is a precious resource. It sets them  apart from  the com petition. Stealing from  them  to aid an LLM is to deny them  of that identity, as well
as their drive to create anything of their own. Those who still have their creative drive and can afford to find work abroad will do so. I thus
have to wonder - what will becom e of the US if all the creativity we have to offer is recycled, regurgitated content from  LLMs? How are
we to com pete with the world if we can no longer add anything new to it?
Allowing AI and AI-adjacent com panies to have unfettered access to content would be nothing short of a disaster. It seem s to m e that this
push from  OpenAI and Google is out of a desire to justify the deep expense of their product, in spite of its increasingly dim inishing returns.
Please do not fall for this.
