General Comment
This is disastrous for the flow of free inform ation. There is no longer any incentive to bother doing original fact-checked writing online,
since the AI scrapers can just take it and turn it into regurgitated “AI overviews” on the search page, which prevents visitors from  com ing
to websites, which prevents websites from  earning any m oney at all. The web will becom e nothing but AI scrapings of older AI scrapings
and Reddit chats.
