I am a citizen of the United States. I am an art hobbyist and do not make money off of my
art, but I know many others who do. I believe that unregulated AI will be detrimental tothe rights of creatives. In particular, it will be damaging to small artistic business owner.In addition, I do not believe that any sort of "AI Dominance" will be of use to the UnitedStates. There is a danger on relying on an unstable technology to run businesses ornational security. It has been shown that the AI models will develop unwanted behaviorswithout human input (https://time.com/7259395/ai-chess-cheating-palisade-
research/ ). Ultimately, allowing AI companies unregulated access to data will be
detrimental to the rights of American citizens.
