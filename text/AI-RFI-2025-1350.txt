General Comment
IF YOU WANT TO CUT DOWN ON WASTEFUL PROGRAMS--CUT ALL LOTTERY!!
PEOPLE SPEND THOUSANDS DAILY ON LOTTERY TICKETS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY PAY OUT! IF
THEY WIN $10.00 THEY SPEND $50.00 MORE! 
DOES THE MONEY FROM LOTTERY REALLY GO TO FUND SCHOLARSHIPS!??? I DOUBT IT! D.O.G.E. NEEDS TO
CHECK ON THAT--WHERE DOES LOTTERY MONEY GO? 
SOME GAMES HARDLY EVER PAY OUT--SUCH AS ARKANSAS LOTTO, OR LUCKY FOR LIFE. SO, WHERE DOES
THAT MAONEY GO AND IS IT RIGGED TO CHOOSE WINNERS??
I HATE LOTTERY! IT IS TRULY A SCAM, IN MY OPINION.
5 plus Lucky Ball 1 in 30,821,472 $1,000 a day for life
5 plus Powerball 1 in 292,201,338 Jackpot
5 + Mega Ball 1 in 302,575,350 Jackpot
5 1 in 575,757 Jackpot
TOTAL WASTE TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN WIN THIS!! WHEN POWERBALL AND MEGAMILLIONS BUILD
UP TO OVER 500 MILLION--PEOPLE SPEND THEIR ENTIRE PAYCHECK ON THIS CRAP! AND USUALLY ONLY ONE
PERSON WINS, SUPPOSEDLY--HOW DO WE KNOW THAT IS TRUE??
