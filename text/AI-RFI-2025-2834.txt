General Comment
This bill essentially allows AI com panies to steal ALL m aterials across hum an creation to feed their gen-AI m odels, com pletely
disregarding copyright and intellectual rights. This is a spit against everything this nation stands for and I am  appalled that lawm akers are so
easily swayed by tech hype into ignoring decades of copyright laws that protect writers, artists, and all hum ans with a creative passion. I
oppose this plan with all m y m ight and every governm ent official who does not fight against this will not have m y vote going forward.
