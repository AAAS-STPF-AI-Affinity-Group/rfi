General Comment
AI is being turduckened into things without understanding if AI is even worth it or helpful in this field.
Essentially it is overhyped. AI does not have a place above anything else in this country, com panies developing it m ust be held
accountable for what they are m aking and the ways they m ake it (by stealing the works of others).
AI does not need any bypass for National Security, you are being fleeced by these com panies.
