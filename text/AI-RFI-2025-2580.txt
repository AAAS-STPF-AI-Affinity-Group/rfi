General Comment
Artificial Intelligence has been a growing concern for m any Am ericans and for good reason. It is not som ething to be thought on lightly, but
it is known that Generative Artificial Intelligence, or GenAI, has been stealing from  copyrighted works across the Internet.
Copyright laws should not be bent for any AI. These laws have been in place for decades and it should always be used to protect
HUMAN artist and HUMAN creators. The com panies who are trying to scrape these things from  sm aller creators should be held to the
law just as everyone else. If they are using copyrighted m aterial, they are not m aking som ething new nor is it beneficial to society. It is only
hurting artists and writers.
Do not rem ove these protections for AI. Do not allow these technologies to take over hum an creation. It is not som ething that will result in
anything positive for anyone.
