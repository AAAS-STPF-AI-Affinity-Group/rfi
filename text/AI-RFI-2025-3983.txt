General Comment
No com pany should be im m une from  following copyright laws (or any other laws). If generative AI cannot succeed without stealing data
and ideas, then that is their problem . Nothing that AI accom plishes is so essential that it should be allowed to underm ine existing law.
Allowing AI com panies to use copyrighted m aterials without perm ission or com pensation to the original owners is unethical, anti-
com petitive, and anti-free m arket.
