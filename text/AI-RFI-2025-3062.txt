General Comment
I find three idea that generative AI should be granted the right to steal abhorrent. The idea that these com panies should be allowed to take
everything with out com pensating others, is a flagrant violation of the LAW. AI steals the livelihood of m y fellow Am ericans and renders
the power of others to share three work im possible. For these com panies, once the greatest cham pions of copyright to be saying it m ust
be destroyed is telling. It is hypocrisy at its finest. I object to idea that it m ust be free to steal the work of others to flourish in the m ost
strenuous way possible.
