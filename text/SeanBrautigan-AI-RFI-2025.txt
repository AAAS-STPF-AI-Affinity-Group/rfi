To whom it may c oncern, 
Of all the modern tec hnologies that have graced our nation, I do not believe AI is going 
to be beneficial for the American people long term. I believe this item/tech has been dishonestly 
overhyped by the various tech industries seeking both unwitting customers and speculative 
profit. There are many Americans crucial to the soul of the nation, being honest hard working 
people in various visual, and, auditory, and literary professions, helping craft the American 
identity, who's livelihoods are threatened by this technology.  
What is especially egregious is the fact that these AI technologies have been trained 
with the various medias of our entire collected history without the permission of the media creators, with a goal of replacing all those unique creators and creations with their own 
technology. How can such a technology be praised when it only exists because othersâ€™ works 
were unlawfully used without their permission?
