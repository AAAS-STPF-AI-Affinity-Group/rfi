General Comment
Generative AI is just a destructive plagiarism  m achine that trawls the internet stealing from  hardworking, talented artists, writers, and other
creatives. It takes huge am ounts of energy that have already begun to take a toll on local power grids. It also sucks up loads of water that
further strains supplies. The vast m ajority of the population does not benefit from  gen AI and will be harm ed in the longrun.
