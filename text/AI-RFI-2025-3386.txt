General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
Recent news articles support this. Google them selves publicly adm itted their AI steals IP and cannot generate or think of new content,
ergo it's a regurgitation m achine -- these are LLM's language learning m odels. None of this is true AI and it's just legalized IP theft which
will irrevocably hurt m illions of hardworking Am ericans who pay taxes and work already in a field the US governm ent has failed to protect
from  predatory contracts, no rights or benefits but publishers and industries can prevent freelancers - I have watched am erican publishers
sneak in secret predatory non com petes and first look options m entioned under language as wanting to rework with an author or m usician
but instead it's a clause m eant to be sat on preventing them  to shop work around even if in financial need despite operating as legal
freelancers as they are not on salary or benefits.
There has been 0 help from  the US govt to already support ip creators/content creators, and this last push is a push to strip that
sovereignty and creative control from  generations of hardworking am ericans who have built am erica's fabric as the preem inent place to be
a creator/artist of any kind.
