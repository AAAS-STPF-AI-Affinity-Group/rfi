General Comment
As a visual artist who m ust now com pete with the generative AI that was trained on m y work and the work of m illions of creative
individuals, I strongly oppose the theft of our copyrighted m aterial by Google and OpenAI.
You cannot support "hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness, and national security" without protecting the individuals who m ake
hum an flourishing possible (i.e. real people, not algorithm s). 
You cannot protect "econom ic com petitiveness" by destroying the right of all artists to own their creative efforts. 
There is no "national security" if the people who produce the wealth of our culture are not protected from  the predatory actions of Google
and OpenAI.
You m ust choose to protect each individual creative artist against the theft of our work by corporations whose sole purpose is the
centralized control of hum an endeavor in order to m axim ize their own bottom  line. The profits of corporations like Google and OpenAi
m eans the annihilation of what is critical to our hum an survival -- the protected free expression of individual thought and action.
