General Comment
Generative AI not only robs recent grads in STEAM of their future, left in endless debt without a way to repay, but it actively
disincentivizes original research and art developm ent by ensuring there is no reward for hard work. AI cannot create original ideas, so the
US will stagnate without new inform ation and the rewards that com e with public participation. It further creates a divide that leaves well-
developed professionals with no legitim ate outlet for their work, both creating legitim ate ire in the population and ensuring that new work is
inaccurate full of hallucinated info, bad code, and unsellable art. 
Furtherm ore, AI cannot be held accountable for decisions, therefore it should never be allowed to m ake decisions that could harm  others
with its judgem ents m ade by hallucinating inform ation, building in biases from  its program m ing such as large am ounts of junk data, and
possible future m alice.
