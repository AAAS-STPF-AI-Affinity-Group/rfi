General Comment
As an artist, I firm ly believe in the protection of Copyright as it stands against AI. AI scraping should be reserved to only those who gain
perm ission, via the copyright holder, to scrape for AI. Rem oving that protection will suddenly put m any jobs in danger of being replaced
by AI that could've gone to Am erican Citizens as AI would be able to scrape their content and voices, allow for IPs owned by Am ericans
to suddenly be twisted into scam s and cause corporations to lose battles against those who m isuse their AI, and would throw Fair Use
into the gutter.
Regulations m ust be m ade for AI to prevent the loss of protected works.
