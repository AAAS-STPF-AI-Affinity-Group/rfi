General Comment
You sim ply cannot just give a com pany free rein to use any inform ation they want regardless of peopleâ€™s consent. This is an unacceptable
breach of privacy and a blatant attem pt to legalize com plete surveillance of the Am erican people. This plan cannot be allowed to happen,
for the good of Our Constitutional Rights.
