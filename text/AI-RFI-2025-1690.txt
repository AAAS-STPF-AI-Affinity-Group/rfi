General Comment
The debate around AI and its influence on everything from  individual livelihoods to whole career field is extensive. However, it should be
universally accepted that utilizing copyrighted work without consent of the creator for com m ercial work is not acceptable. Directly or
indirectly, allowing com panies to train their AI m odels off of the products of individuals who have not given reasonable consent for such
use, opens doors that m ust be recognized. Just as m any of these cases, it sets a precedent that copyright holds no value, that private
cooperations m ay use and exploit private products and individuals creations for com m ercial use without worry. It begins with training AI,
however if AI m ay utilize and, indirectly, copy the m aterial- what stops the com panies in question from  attem pting to m ore directly steal
with the sam e logic? Be it a program  stealing the m aterial or a hum an, theft is theft. AI should not be dem onized as an evolving and useful
tool to be utilized by m any fields- but progress should not blind from  the reality of the blatant and unapologetic theft. AI should face the
sam e restrictions applied to all, and as such held to the standard that only m aterial the user has gained proper reasonable perm ission to
utilize m ay be used for com m ercial purposes- such as training an AI that can and will be used, com m ercially.
