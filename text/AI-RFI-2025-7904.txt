General Comment
There are productive uses for m achine learning to be sure, uses that will change hum an lives for the better. Program s that can learn to
detect cancer far before a hum an can, for instance. However, the only thing allowing generative ai to steal from  creators by circum venting
copyright protection and other "burdensom e requirem ents" will do is hurt the livelihoods of hum an artists, if not others.
