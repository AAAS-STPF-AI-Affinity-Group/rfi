General Comment
This is such a blatantly bad idea to give AI this m uch power to steal and lie and ya'll are just okay with that? Why? So you can shave a
couple dollars off and m ake even m ore m oney? All your doing is shooting yourself in the foot by instilling distrust in anyone who is aware
of this and hurting literately everyone. I hope this weighs on your conscience and m akes you reconsider your terrible choices not just here
but in working on AI in the first place.
