General Comment
AI is not im perative for national security or has any purpose being trained on copyrighted m aterial. This is intrinsically anti-capitalist
allowing com panies to pirate and steal while not paying prices for the m aterials essentially bypassing the free m arket and protection put in
place, such as copyright and tradem arks, to allow people to m ake m oney off what they create and allowing any com pany to bypass these
is un-Am erican and as previously stated anti-capitalist.
