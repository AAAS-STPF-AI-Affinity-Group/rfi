General Comment
So-called "AI" com panies have m ade all their developm ent and profit off of stolen content and data harvested without consent, producing
content based on that stolen inform ation and profiting from  it. This is in blatant violation of copyright law, and of the rights and dignity of
artists, writers, journalists, and countless others. This cannot be allowed to continue unabated or go unpunished. Measures m ust be put
into place that forbid "AI" com panies from  grabbing whatever data they want off the internet, throwing it into a blender, and selling the
resultant sludge. Com panies who have already done this m ust be punished com m ensurate to the im m ense quantity of work they have
stolen for their own ends. Creators who put countless hours into their work are being robbed, plagiarized, and having their livelihoods
jeopardized as "AI" com panies attem pt to replace them  by taking and reselling the results of their labor without consent. "AI" presents
m assive dangers to working Am erican creators and to society at large, and it needs to be m ore regulated, not less.
