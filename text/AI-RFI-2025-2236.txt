General Comment
Ai should be used com putationally and academ ically not to generate writing and art. AI needs to be regulated or you risk diluting our
culture and the voices of artists both visually and literary. AI is a great tool for calculating num bers but has been shown again and again
that it is not to be trusted with facts and im ages (see the story of the AI saying that triangles have four sides and the fact that m y phone
calls a table a dog). Regulate AI use or it will open up lawsuits and create unsafe situations.
