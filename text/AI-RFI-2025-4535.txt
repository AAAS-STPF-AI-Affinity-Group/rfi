General Comment
Hello, dear reader or whoever m ay read this. Like m ost of the com m ents you will receive in this com m ent section, I am  highly against the
unregulation of AI technology in any form  of culture or the future of society. The dangers of unregulated technology are a frightening and
dangerous situation that can put a lot of industries, sm all businesses, arts, and entertainm ent in danger. I know that is probably som ething
big tech or our governm ent really considers worth anything; however, if unregulated, think of all the dam age it could do. Fake headlines,
pictures, and videos. This kind of technology can cause irreparable harm . Wars could even be started from  these dangerous practices, so
please reconsider.
