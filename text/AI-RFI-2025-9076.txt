General Comment
There needs to be m ore guard rails, not less when in com es to AI. While I feel there good uses for it, such as the use of iterative AI in
regards to m edical diagnoses or astronom y, sim ply letting OpenAI and ChaptGPT have free reign to feed into the wood chipper any
copyrighted m aterial is wrong. For a com pany that com plained so m uch that the Chinese stole their product it is rich that they are begging
to be allowed to steal people's art, writing, m usic, likenesses, even their voice to be able to feed the beast and boost their profit. We will
not see security, we will not see innovation, instead we will watch a culture created algorithm ically becom e m eaningless, we will see
harm ful treatm ent of people from  decisions never m ade by a m achine, and we will see the am plification of worst of our natures if AI is
allowed to grow unchecked and unregulated.
