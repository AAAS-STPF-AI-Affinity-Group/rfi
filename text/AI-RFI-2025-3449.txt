General Comment
As things stand, generative AI is already negatively im pact research. It has becom e harder than ever to reasonably search just for accurate
im ages of anim als, and AI works are already flooding of scientific journals is an active waste of tim e for all m ajor publications, to the point
where AI search tools are being m ade to com bat the growing issue (Source: https://www.nature.com /articles/d41586-022-04245-8).
If we continue down this road and prom ote generative AI over scientific inquiry, we will further lose our standing as a world leader in
research, and will actively harm  our abilities in getting high quality research accepted.
On top of this, if you want to better protect sm all businesses, you want to stop generative AI, which is already cutting the jobs of writers
and researchers and graphic designers and artists and m ore creatives across the world. We won't get fresh new ideas out of generative
AI, we'll get rem ixes of the sam e, and the world will be less bright and less likely to raise incom e for it.
Please consider putting your efforts towards reducing the use of generative AI, not increasing it. Thank you for your tim e.
