General Comment
This is absolutely outrageous. Regardless of the usefulness of AI, I'm  not sure how any IP related industry will survive this sort of
underm ining of copyright. How are you supposed to run a profitable business if any aspect of it can just be hoovered up and copied and
sold through a generative AI m odel?
