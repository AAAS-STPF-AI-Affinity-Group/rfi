General Comment
I'd really rather not have the future generations of Am erican children have their ability to think surrendered to the whim s of greedy tech bro
assholes and their toys. If Open AI can't survive without unlim ited access to the sam e copy-written m aterial that was jealously guarded for
decades by corporations, then they don't deserve to exist. Everyone else has to worry about being sued by these m ega corporations, but
these tech bros don't? Sorry, they don't get that privilege.
