General Comment
Do not let OpenAI use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI, it is theft from  other creators and producers, and a threat to capitalism  itself
if there is only one sole com pany allowed to do whatever they like with the creations of the public. AI is a threat to Am ericaâ€™s future. It
has stolen jobs and m aterial already, it consum es so m uch energy, and it will only get worse if legalized. Open AI should only work with
what it is given. Copyrights will be com pletely disregarded in the future if on large com pany is allowed to bypass it, which again, is a threat
to capitalism .
