Our privacy expertise enables responsible AI development in healthcare, with leading 
statisticians and data scientists supporting innovation while maintaining robust privacy 
protections for sensitive health information. We analyze both conventional machine 
learning models and large language models (LLMs) for privacy implications and proudly 
contribute to the NAIRR Pilot with our privacy-preserving record linkage platform. 
Datavant also uses AI to support work ﬂows across multiple healthcare payment and 
operational functions to reduce costs and improve the accuracy and quality of the 
results delivered to our customers. In support of our healthcare provider and health plan 
customers, our AI solutions provide a more comprehensive understanding and thorough 
evaluation of relevant clinical data for use cases that enable active engagement, 
improve patient care, and contribute to accurate documentation. For instance, we use AI 
to augment the identiﬁcation of car e gaps for healthcare provider assessments; 
accelerating the analysis of chart quality as well as the accuracy of administrative 
coding documentation by human reviewers. Our AI solutions can also enable proactive 
disease risk identi ﬁcation and personalized care management by analyzing patterns in 
clinical data to predict potential health concerns before they manifest, allowing health 
plans and healthcare providers to implement preventive interventions and develop 
tailored care plans that address individual patient needs prospectively rather than 
reactively. 
Our recommendations are guided by the following principles: 
Principle 1: Regulatory fragmentation threatens AI innovation. A consensus-based 
deﬁnition of “high-risk AI” and risk-based AI standards should be established at the 
Federal level. 
AI tools have many current and potential applications in the health data sector. 
However, it is important to recognize that privacy and security concerns–particularly 
regarding the processing of sensitive health data–have driven state legislatures to 
introduce hundreds of bills in an attempt to regulate AI and assuage consumer and 
patient uncertainties. This regulatory patchwork: 
●Stiﬂes innovation through compliance  complexity

●Creates geographic barriers to AI deployment
●Deepens consumer confusion about AI bene ﬁts and risks
●Hampers American competitiveness in global AI development
Datavant believes–echoing the perspective of industry thought leaders at the 
Healthcare Trust Institute and the Future of Privacy Forum–that AI standards should be 
established at the Federal level to avoid the ever-increasing layers of State-driven 
regulatory complexity, industry confusion, and–ultimately–consumer and patient 
distrust of AI. 
Principle 2: AI innovation in healthcare must operate within a dual framework that 
leverages advanced technologies while simultaneously ensuring all applications are built 
on a foundation of measurable privacy standards. 
This principle recognizes that AI's transformative potential in healthcare cannot be 
realized without maintaining public trust through demonstrable privacy safeguards and 
clear standards for responsible use. It addresses the fundamental tension at the heart 
of healthcare AI adoption. Without strong privacy protections and governance, 
healthcare stakeholders will resist sharing the data needed to power AI innovation, 
creating a cycle of data scarcity that undermines American competitiveness.  
Datavant is actively developing privacy metrics with quanti ﬁable thresholds and 
fostering industry-wide dialogue to achieve consensus on privacy standards and risks 
associated with AI and related technologies. We stand ready to contribute our expertise 
to this national priority, bringing together stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem 
to develop measurable standards and advance privacy-enhancing technologies that will 
unlock AI's full potential while preserving the trust that is essential to our healthcare 
system. With proper federal leadership and coordination, we can ensure that American 
patients beneﬁt from AI-power ed medical breakthroughs while maintaining con ﬁdence 
in the security and privacy  of their most  sensitive information.

Actionable Recommendations 
Based on our extensive experience at the intersection of health information privacy, 
interoperability, and health data-driven innovation, Datavant proposes the following ﬁve 
recommendations as a practical roadmap for ensuring privacy-preserving AI in 
healthcare while addressing the urgent challenges posed by today’s fragmented 
regulatory landscape. 
Recommendation #1: Collaborate with industry to establish privacy-preserving, 
outcome-oriented health data governance frameworks. 
To maximize AI innovation while maintaining appropriate privacy and security 
safeguards, health data governance frameworks should focus on outcomes rather than 
prescriptive technical approaches. A privacy-preserving outcome-oriented approach to 
health data governance should: 
●Enable access to high-quality, representative data while protecting patient privacy
●Create standardized formats and protocols for secure data exchange
●Require regular data audits while avoiding restrictive technical mandates
●Establish a hub of de-identi ﬁed, tokeniz ed data with documented provenance to
facilitate AI development, monitoring, and ongoing safety evaluations
It is important to advance policies that make high-quality, ﬁt-for-purpose health data 
accessible at scale while balancing privacy and security. Access to high-quality data is 
an integral part of AI development, deployment, and monitoring. In this regard, having a 
hub of de-identi ﬁed, tokeniz ed data with documented data provenance that is 
accessible by interested parties such as researchers and innovators would be 
transformative for health AI advancement. 
Recommendation #2: Partner with the private sector to create a framework for 
privacy-preserving health AI that includes rigorous testing against de ﬁned privacy 
standar ds. 
The Administration should partner with the private sector to create a comprehensive 
framework that integrates privacy standards with testing protocols for healthcare AI. 
This uni ﬁed approach should  require entities using AI to adopt robust patient privacy

and security platforms while establishing clear performance benchmarks for AI 
systems. The framework could include: 
●Transparent documentation of AI model data inputs, including data sources and
training methodologies
●De-identi ﬁcation protocols  for training data to prevent privacy risk, with controls
to limit re-identi ﬁcation risks as data prolifer ates thr ough AI systems
●Regular auditing and testing of AI systems against established privacy and
performance standards
●Iterative re-evaluation of privacy protections when models are retrained or
expanded with new data
This approach recognizes that privacy protection and performance validation are 
interconnected aspects of responsible health AI development that should be addressed 
through a single, coherent framework rather than separate regulatory regimes. 
Recommendation #3: Develop a risk-based health AI classi ﬁcation system that 
accelerates administrative AI while appropriately regulating clinical models, including 
those clinical AI applications that fall outside the FDA’s purview. 
To prevent regulatory overreach while ensuring patient safety, the Administration should 
facilitate public-private consensus on a healthcare-speci ﬁc risk classi ﬁcation system for 
AI that: 
●Clearly distinguishes between administrative and clinical AI applications,
recognizing their fundamentally different risk proﬁles
●Establishes streamlined pathways for low-risk administrative AI that addresses
pressing operational challenges like billing optimization, care management
eﬃciency, and administrative work ﬂow improv ement
●Creates a tiered regulatory approach proportionate to risk, with a lightweight
framework for low-risk, high-impact administrative applications and more
rigorous requirements for clinical decision support and diagnostic tools

●Acknowledges the signi ﬁcant opportunity costs of dela ying administrative AI
innovations that could alleviate healthcare workforce burnout and system
ineﬃciencies
●Establishes guidance on when AI transitions from administrative to clinical
categorization as applications and contexts of use evolve
●Regularly updates classi ﬁcation criteria to account for e volving capabilities and
real-world performance data
This risk-based classi ﬁcation would prev ent the application of unnecessarily 
burdensome requirements to administrative AI solutions that pose minimal risk while 
addressing critical healthcare operational needs. 
Recommendation #4: The Administration should proceed with the National AI Research 
Resource (NAIRR) as a key public-private partnership to advance AI across a range of 
different sectors and applications.  
The NAIRR Pilot aims to connect U.S. researchers and educators to computational, 
data, and training resources needed to advance AI research and research that employs 
AI. Federal agencies are collaborating with government-supported and 
non-governmental partners to implement the Pilot as a preparatory step toward an 
eventual full NAIRR implementation. As a founding non-governmental partner, Datavant 
has appreciated the opportunity to collaborate with federal and private sector 
stakeholders on a range of AI-related issues. This is important work that aligns with the 
Administration’s goals of promoting American AI leadership, supporting private-sector 
AI development, and enhancing national competitiveness.  
Datavant supports the formulation of a full- ﬂedged NAIRR and encourages the 
continued public-private partnership explored under the NAIRR Pilot as a productive 
approach to formulating NAIRR. As part of the NAIRR, we urge the creation of 
domain-speciﬁc industry committees  and councils to ensure the AI Action Plan bene ﬁts 
from agency, public, and private sect or expertise.

Recommendation #5: Promote the use of privacy-enhancing technologies to support AI 
innovation. PETs enable a broad variety of organizations to collaborate on AI 
development without exposing personally identiﬁable information (PII), protected health 
information (PHI), or proprietary data.  
Within the health sector, using Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PET) is critical for 
compliant data sharing. Given the rapidly evolving patchwork of privacy legislation and 
regulations at the state level, a data-sharing approach that enables health sector data to 
be shared safely, securely, and compliantly is the key to a comprehensive data strategy 
that underpins the nation’s AI initiatives.  
Datavant is the health sector leader in privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL), which 
is a type of PET and would welcome the opportunity to collaborate and inform in order 
to incorporate PET and PPRL use more broadly in an AI Action Plan. Even more 
promising is that PPRL can ultimately set a bar for a scalable method for advancing AI 
innovation without exposing PII and PHI found in real world data sets. The AI Action 
Plan should foster the adoption of proven PETs at scale by: 
● Promoting strategic investment in PPRL as supported by Datavant's successful 
implementation of tokenization and linkage across 500+ healthcare 
organizations 
● Enabling interagency data sharing via PPRL without exposing sensitive 
information 
● Creating standards for PET interoperability across proprietary platforms 
● Incentivizing broader PET adoption through federal procurement preferences 
For additional context, PPRL has been used successfully in several contexts and 
continues to show promise. For example:  
● Datavant’s PPRL has been adopted extensively by 500+ organizations within the 
health sector to enable privacy-preserving real world data acquisition and 
exchange, encompassing electronic health record (EHR) data, medical claims, 
specialty labs and diagnostics, retail pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, and social 
determinants of health data. ● Datavant has enabled interagency initiatives between federal agencies, such as 
data sharing between the NIH and CMS via the National Clinical Cohort

Collaborative (N3C), led by the National Center for Advancing Translational 
Sciences (NCATS). The N3C is one of the NIH’s reference implementations for 
the NAIRR Pilot. Datavant leads the privacy-preserving infrastructure and data 
governance related to the N3C. 
●Datavant’s implementation of PPRL enables token interoperability with other
PPRL solutions. This is integral to the eﬃcient pooling and aggregation  of data,
which ensures data initiatives can continue to scale without revisiting PPRL
vendors, even on proprietary platforms.
