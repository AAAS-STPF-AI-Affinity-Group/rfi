General Comment
So called "AI" is nothing m ore than plagiarism  and regurgitation. It does not think; it does not com prehend. It only copies and pastes
things that already exist, then applies random ization and statistical likelihood to m ix up its outcom es. AI output cannot be protected by
copyright because it is stolen and plagiarized from  other creations which are them selves copyright protected. In short it's garbage.
