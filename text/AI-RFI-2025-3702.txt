General Comment
This plan is showing blatant favoritism  for AI businesses over the general wellbeing of creators and academ ics everywhere. It supports the
theft of inform ation without com pensation, harvesting m assive am ounts of data for projects that will not advance the econom y or national
security. To be frank, itâ€™s selling out the population to corporations under the guise of progress.
