General Comment
Generative AI is neither artificial or intelligent. It is a plagiarism  m achine that regurgitates the hum an-created input it is fed. Com panies are
pushing to lower regulation because they know they cannot survive in a fair m arket where they need to pay for the content their m odels
are trained on. The governm ent should not create unfair advantages for these com panies, but should allow them  to fail or succeed on their
own m erits.
