I am writing to condemn the allowance of AI companies to use any work however they may please. The hard work
and effort that goes into creating art of any kind must be valued, and as such, this ignorance of the lived experienceand abilities of our people is unacceptable. AI fails as a way to learn satisfying skills in life and dictates that we havebecome too reliable on technology. We must turn around and reclaim those skills that we once treasured and stoptaking life’s most precious gifts for granted. There’s only so much money we can earn from AI before we startasking if earning it from hard work is a better option.
