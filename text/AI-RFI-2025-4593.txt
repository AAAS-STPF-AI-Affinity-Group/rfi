General Comment
This is an adm ission that AI technology cannot advance without blatant theft. OpenAI is not entitled to our intellectual property. If they
cannot abide by the sam e copyright and tradem ark laws that have protected the rights of artists for decades, they donâ€™t deserve to stay in
business.
