General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica. Generative AI is harm ful to hum an culture in irreparable ways; It violates
Am ericans' RIGHTS to their own intellectual property, allows m isinform ation to be spread at unprecedented rates, and will absolutely
destroy Am erican industries. It is becom ing a disease that m ust be stopped before it spreads any further.
