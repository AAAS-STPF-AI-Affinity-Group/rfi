Greetings,
Through our website and community outreach efforts, AI World  supports the revitalization of
businesses in small towns across America. We encourage an action plan that not only
addresses the vitality of Main Street America, but also is directed towards those businessesthat could be adversely impacted by Artificial Intelligence (AI). We advocate allocating funds toenable a program like Main Street America be employed to help communities that lack theresources
 to compete with larger competitors that are rapidly adopting AI.
An effective action plan can include assistance targeting, say, threatened historic Main Streetcommunities, in a manner similar to the work done by Ben and Erin Napier from HGTV whenthey revitalized several small towns in their popular Home Town Takeover
 series. Our action
plan advocates finding common AI solutions to enable small town businesses to compete andthrive, enabling and enhancing small town community life.AI World
AI World serves as a comprehensive resource for artificial intelligence (AI), offering a wide
array of information, tools, and insights into various facets of AI.
