Giving more power to AI corporations will introduce mass theft into any industry AI touches.
Power will be taken from inventors and creatives, and be given to slackers that profit off ofother people's hard work. If not for moral reasons, this is a bad idea because jobs are being cutin exchange for more wasteful use of expensive to maintain technology that will end upcosting more than it would to continue hiring inventors, developers, artists, writers, etc.
