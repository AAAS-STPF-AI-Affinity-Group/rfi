2.5.2 Cybersecurity  
The cyberthreat landscape facing the United States is dominated by increasingly sophisticated, organized, industrialized malicious nation state s and cybercriminal actors. These actors are 
using AI as a powerful tool  to create more effective attacks, such as more realistic, plausible 
spear  phishing and social engineering attacks. The threat spans the entire life cycle of 
hardware, firmware, software and data: supply chain, production, and operation. Mitigating 
this re quires a multi- faceted defense -in-depth approach that also spans the entire life cycle  to 
deliver AI systems that are secure by design , while delivering great  performance and are easy to 
use.  
Challenges: The possibility of a malicious actor having access to a cryptographically relevant 
quantum computer is a serious threat to the United States. Such a computer render s the 
current deployed secure protocols, firmware, and software verification mechanisms to be ineffective. Quantum- secure cryptographic algorit hms exist , and, i n many cases, it will be 
possible to upgrade software and firmware stacks in the field. Unfortunately , silicon parts 
cannot be changed after manufacturing , so it  is urgent to transition hardware roots of trust and 
keys fused in silicon to quantum- secure algorithms. Failure to do so will mean that attackers  


with access to a quantum computer will be able to sign malicious firmware that will be treated 
as legitimate by the system under attack, giving the threat actor full control over that sys tem. 
Opportunities : AI technologies can transform cybersecurity vulnerability management. The 
scarcity of trained, experienced cybersecurity professionals is a well -known challenge. While 
there has been a push towards automation for years, many tasks have remained manual. AI may assist by automating tasks, such as false positive filtering, that today generally rely on a 
human. AI may enable a level of simulating attacks, control effectiveness, and response 
capabilities far beyond what can be presently achieved. One especially compelling aspect of this potential for AI is to analyze complex attack chain scenarios that are currently intractable.  
Recommend ed actions  include:  
•Investing  in protection against tampering of AI models and data , such as trojan
backdoors inserted by malicious actors in hardware, firmware , and software. This is
particularly challenging for the open -source community where over -worked software
maintainers are hard -pressed to provide adequate reviews of new code submitted to
projects . AI-driven inspection together with cryptographic attestation and tracking of
lineage can help mitigate this problem.  Investment is required to develop these
capabilities.
•Investing  in services for easy measurement and verification of operating platforms .
Although the basic concepts and hardware support for secure measurement and
attestation have  been in place for well over a decade (e.g. , Trusted Platform Modules),
the software and management services to enable their widespread use are  missing.
•Promot ing industry -standard Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)  for processors,
GPUs , and other devices. TEEs have given rise to an  emerging paradigm called
Confidential Computing in which data is protected by encryption at rest, in transit, and
in memory. Data is accessible only to verified TEEs; it is isolated by encryption from allother entities. This offers greatly enhanced protection of data from malicious insiders
and from malicious actors who have stolen credentials from legitimate operators.
2.5.3 Data Privacy and Security  
Robust data and model provenance and governance enable AI pipelines and collaboration. 
Challenges: AI systems have attack surfaces which are different from  non-AI systems. In the 
supply chain, this includes model tampering, poisoning , and data tampering. In operation , the 
difficulty in bounding the behavior of AI systems makes it challenging to secure applications and 
introduces new attacks such as prompt injection, jail breaking, perturbation, model 
reprogramming, hallucination s, and model stealing.  For safe operation, further investment is 
required to protect against the se new attacks . 
Opportunities : AI systems have a significant role to play in securing the operation of other AI 
systems and a robust data and model governance framework is required that prioritizes data 
and model quality, security, privacy, and accessibility.  


Recommend ed actions include : 
•Establish ing guidelines  for c lear ownership and licensing, rigorous quality assurance ,
and strong security measures . Tracking data and model lineage, and ensuring user -
friendly access maximize s the data value and explainability of derived  AI products.
•Investing  in a “knowledge nurturing platform” to  accelerate AI in scientific discovery ,
innovation, and enhance public trust. It shoul d include a collaborative platform, a data
historian, a data vault, easy and fluid data services, incentive models for both
contributors and curators, and embargoed access policy enforcement tools.
•Establish ing robust data and metadata governance practice s that are key for the
success of AI -based pipelines for science, given the tight dependence of AI models on
data.
2.5.4 National Security and Defense  
Technology is at a tipping point in the age of AI. AI promises advancements at all levels of 
computing and has the potential to revolutionize science and engineering. By integrating AI with modeling, simulations, big data, and high -performance data analytics, the Department of
