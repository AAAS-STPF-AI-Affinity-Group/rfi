General Comment
The only "benefit" this kind of plan would have would be to weaken current protections on all copyrighted m aterials, in return for nothing
of value; generative AI is at best an excuse to do poor work in place of paying for actually good work in creative spheres, and should not
be encouraged at all. If anything, a plan should be m ade to strengthen copyright protections for artists of all stripes to help ensure creative
endeavors continue to flourish, rather than seeing them  turn into nothing but a cesspool of AI-generated slop that "trains" on m ore AI
garbage.
While AI does have its uses, art and writing and other creative pursuits do not benefit from  it at all, and this is not in any way a good use
of the country's tim e and resources.
