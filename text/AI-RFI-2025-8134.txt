General Comment
AI, in its current state, with current laws, does not have a place in the future of the United States. It is severely unreliable, answering
straightforward questions in a hallucinatory m anner. Its servers are bloated with contradicting inform ation it cannot discern as fiction or
fact. Generative AI steals from  artists, taking im ages protected by copyright, and allowing people with no appreciation for the creative
process to profit off stolen work. It does not think, it does not feel, it is a ghost in a m achine that costs m ore energy to run than the useless
drivel it spittles out in return. It m akes people stupid. It cannot be allowed to create, to judge, or god forbid, to govern.
