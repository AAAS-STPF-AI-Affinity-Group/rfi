General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US because it steals from  the Am erican people's livelihood and profits off of theft as
well as deceiving the eyes of the Am erican public. As an Am erican, it is already frustrating to know that copyright laws protecting our
personal content from  being stolen and trained off of in this country is flim sy.
