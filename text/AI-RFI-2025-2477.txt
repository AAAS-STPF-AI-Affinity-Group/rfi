General Comment
I am  concerned about the sources of inform ation that AI have access to, and the lack of transparency with which they are used. The risk
is too great that these could pull from  sources that are anti-Am erican and include subtle propaganda. We've already seen m any instances
in which children are using it and getting wrong facts, and I am  deeply concerned that it could be turned to m islead them  in far worse
ways.
