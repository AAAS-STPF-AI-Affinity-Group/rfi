General Comment
Hello, I am  a writer and educator. As a writer, I resent the im plication that m y intellectual property is not m ine to protect. Why? Because
Sam  Altm an has m ore m oney than m e and can afford m ore lawyers?
As an educator I am  seeing the deleterious effects of AI on students. They use it to cheat, deceive, and disguise their own m eager efforts. 
LLMs “learn” by stealing. This cannot be sanctioned. But of course I know that the Trum p adm inistration is designed, like AI itself, to
enable theft without penalty for the ultra-rich. That doesn’t m ean I have to approve.
