General Comment
This is the legalization of intellectual infringem ent that tens of thousands of digitally active businesses and tens of m illions of digitally active
Am ericans do not consent to. Artificial Intelligence-powered generative program s (often referred to as AI-gen program s) are harm ful in
the sense of offering no credit for individuals or com panies whose artworks and properties--be they visual, written, voiced, or coded--and
putting them  into their databases anyway. Said databases are also phenom enally power-consum ing and require constant usage of clean
and filtered fresh water. Fresh water that could instead be going to com m unities and citizens that are in need of it for their daily lives, now
being used for processor-cooling of program s that are very highly inept at their intended purposes and alm ost entirely used for
entertainm ent. The ram pant intellectual property theft is heinous on its own, but the environm ental repercussions are despicable, and until
such a tim e as the creators and owners of any and all AI-gen program s can adapt them  to be far m ore energy and water effecient AND
achieve adequate function through Free Use libraries and public dom ain properties, there should be no legal protections for these
com panies and their operations.
