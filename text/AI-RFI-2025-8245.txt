General Comment
This is a disgusting plan. The integrity and ownership of creative works, personal posting, and other intellectual property should not be
infringed upon for such disgustingly self-centered and exploitative profit as this intends. Artificial intelligence data pools should ALWAYS
be m anually "opt-in" and should never be able to blanket scrape som eone's m aterials, photos, data, or other inform ation without explicit
perm ission. To allow anything else is both an ethical and m oral violation against the people. It is a risk not only to individuals but also
provides potential risk to their em ploym ent, relationships, and com m unities. STOP THESE ABUSES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
