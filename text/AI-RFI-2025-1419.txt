AI is poised to resha pe the U.S. labor market, with estimates 
suggesting that 80% of the workforce will be impacted by the 
diffusion of current AI systems. While AI  pr o mises signific a nt

surpass human performance in most cognitive work tasks within just 
a few years. T he la bo r ma r k et imp a ct s o f such a n a d v a ncement a r e

A dual-pronged policy response is needed—one that both monitors 
AIʼs impact and strengthens society ʼs ability to adapt to potentially 
rapid economic change. T his br ief r eco mmends po lic y a ctio ns t o

workers and ensure that AI-driven productivity fuels economic 
growth and national competitiveness. 
The policy challenge 
AI is already reshaping our workforce, with substantially more profound 
impacts ahead. Current general-purpose AI is likely to transform the nature 
of many existing jobs, create new jobs, and eliminate others. Impacts on 
employment and wages will vary signiﬁcantly across sectors and worker 
groups, though roughly 80% of the U.S. workforce is likely to be impacted in 


U .S. A I A C TIO N PLA N R FI R ESPO NSE | M A R C H 2025 | 2 
some way by today’s AI systems as they are adopted across the economy.1 
Some leading AI developers predict autonomous AI agents capable of 
replacing cognitive workers could emerge within two to three years.2 In this 
scenario, policymakers should expect profound impacts on the labor market.3 
Some workers will bene ﬁt greatly while many others will face displacement 
and reduced economic security. 
Addressing workforce disruption from AI is necessary to promote human 
ﬂourishing and ensure continued U.S. AI leadership. The urgency of this 
challenge is re ﬂected in public concerns—as of January 2025, 32% of 
surveyed Americans expressed concern about their own job eventually being 
automated.4 This apprehension matters because continued AI progress 
depends on broad social support. For American AI leadership to endure, 
workers must see AI advances as aligned with their own economic interests, 
not opposed to them. Therefore, effective policies must strike a balance: 
supporting workers through transitions while simultaneously encouraging AI 
innovation, economic growth, and national competitiveness.

Policy responses require ﬂexibility amid uncertainty. The pace, scale, and 
distribution of labor market impacts remain dif ﬁcult to predict with 
certainty.5 Nevertheless, mounting evidence suggests we should approach 
this transition with caution and preparedness rather than complacency. 
Effective policy planning demands real-time labor market data collection to 
identify which workers are being affected and how impacts manifest across 
sectors. This visibility can enable policymakers to determine when and where 
targeted government action may be necessary. 
Policy options 
This brief recommends a dual-pronged policy strategy: monitor impacts and 
build adaptive capacity. 
Monit or imp act s 
Sustain high-frequency data collection on AI adoption and business 
impacts. Ensure that the Of ﬁce of Management and Budget approves the 
pending request to add an AI supplement to the Census Bureau’s Business 
Trends and Outlook Survey.6 This would enable biweekly data collection from 
tens of thousands of ﬁrms across the U.S. on their usage of AI and its impact 
on employment and wages. The AI supplement that ran as part of the 
Business Trends and Outlook Survey between September 2023 and February 
2024 provided the single best monthly estimate of business-level AI adoption 
in the US. Continued high-frequency data collection on AI adoption going 
forward can enable researchers to better identify the impact of AI diffusion 
on key outcomes like wages, employment, and demand for skills. Encourage leading AI companies to share informa tion abou t AI's economic 
impacts. Leading AI developers should be encouraged to regularly publish 
anonymized information about the use of their general-purpose AI across the 
economy. Anthropic recently started to do this with its Economic Index, but 
this effort can be expanded to allow for improved visibility into AI’s 
automation impacts. Improved economic impact reporting should focus on 
identifying automation patterns from usage data, including data on 
high-volume API use and business use of frontier AI systems. 
Improve occupational transition tracking. Direct the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics to collect and publish quarterly job transition data at the 
occupation-to-occupation level, rather than only industry-to-industry 
transition data, so that researchers and government ofﬁcials can be better 
equipped to identify the relationship between AI usage and job changes over 
time. 
Initiate high-risk occupation moni toring. Establish specialized tracking for 
occupations with the highest projected vulnerability to AI-driven disruption

in the near term (see Figure 1 and Table 1). Prioritize data collection on AI 
adoption, hiring, and job separations in these occupations so that 
researchers and policymakers can assess the accuracy of present-day 
predictions about disruption potential for workers in these jobs. This data 
can then be used to develop more accurate forecasts of future impacts 
across the economy.  
Streamline researcher access to critical data. Current processes for 
accessing Census con ﬁdential data, for example, involve extensive paperwork 
and reviews that take several months. Approved researchers are then 
sometimes required to travel to designated facilities to access and use 
government data. To accelerate research on AI’s workforce impacts and 
provide real-time insights for policymakers, OSTP should task the Census 
Bureau to develop secure remote access protocols that enable qualiﬁed 
researchers to work with relevant datasets on a rolling basis. Ensuring that 
independent researchers have streamlined access to government data on AI 
adoption and economic outcomes will allow them to connect these insights 
with private sector data on job postings and AI usage, creating a more timely 
and comprehensive understanding of how AI is reshaping labor markets.

Build  adaptiv e c ap acit y 
Explore establishing a scalable automation adjustment assistance program 
that can be responsive to labor market impacts. Task the Department of 


U .S. A I A C TIO N PLA N R FI R ESPO NSE | M A R C H 2025 | 5 
Labor to explore establishing an automation adjustment assistance initiative 
that can deliver targeted support to affected workers in high-risk 
occupations, and could ﬂexibly expand as needed based on AI automation 
and job transition data. Such a program could be modeled in part after 
certain aspects of previous bipartisan initiatives like Trade Adjustment 
Assistance (TAA), which aimed to support American workers whose jobs were 
affected by trade with China.7  
Champion widespread access to AI's productivity bene ﬁts. Coordinate with 
Congress, relevant federal agencies, industry associations, and AI companies 
to support programs that ensure AI productivity gains bene ﬁt workers across 
all economic sectors. This includes collaborating with states to integrate AI 
literacy as a core component of educational curricula,8 and establishing 
public-private partnerships that can make productivity-enhancing AI tools 
more accessible to a wide range of workers. 
Establish an adaptive response framework. Bring together industry leaders, 
relevant agency heads, and academic experts to develop scenario-based 
planning for AI workforce impacts. Task this group with deﬁning metrics to 
track the pace and scale of labor market disruption, preparing coordinated 
policy responses calibrated to different impact scenarios, and establishing 
mechanisms for agencies to adapt rapidly as AI capabilities evolve. This 
approach would enable policymakers to adjust regulations, funding 
allocations, and support programs based on emerging trends, rather than 
reacting after signiﬁcant disruption has occurred.9

General Comment
All inform ation about AI (artificial intelligence) should be taken with a grain of salt. The gains that "AI" has m ade in recent years have been
m ild at best, and really only serve to drain the wallets of speculative investors, while the actual "AI" product provides no actual value
besides weak gim m icks. That all com bined with the fact that "AI" server farm s take an enorm ous am ount of energy from  our power grid,
while providing nothing of actual substance.
The use of the term  INTELLIGENCE in AI also im plies that these program s have intelligence, but truly, all AI does is re-word and re-
create inform ation that has been fed into it's algorithm s, this inform ation, which is com m only stolen from  actual hum an creators.
The current state of "AI" is nothing m ore than an autom atic thesaurus, copying work from  others the sam e way a lazy student would copy
the hom ework of their peers, providing nothing of value to the populace.
Instead of giving speculative "what-if" investing into "AI", that m oney should be going to im proving the wellbeing of the citizens of this great
nation, and the people of the world.
