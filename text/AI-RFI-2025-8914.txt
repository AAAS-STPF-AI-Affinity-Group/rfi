General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US; as steals from  m y, and m any other people's; such as Artists, Musicians, and
educators, livelihoods as an Am erican and profits off of theft. Also, despite the m assive push for it, AI is overhyped and is fleecing the
eyes of the Am erican public. Much of the Am erican public is seeing not only the econom ical downside of Generative AI, but also
Ecological dam ages Generative AI inflicts on the planet as well, and thus not m any people wish to use it.
