As a creative who has had my entire almost 40 year body of works scraped for the purpose of AI 
without  my consent or permission with no compensation, credit, or otherwise back to me, large 
language models are a massive infringement on my copyright. On top of this, AI and its ability to 
make "art" encroaches on my ability to find fair paying creative endeavors, dilutes the meaning of "digital art" as a medium as a whole, and additionally sews uncertainty amongst my clients, customers, and viewers, causing untold reputational damage when and if people accuse or suggest that my hand-created works are used with assistance for AI. AI, even though I don't use it, causes additional work from me as I need to demonstrate to my clients that I am not utilizing these in  any way when creating works for them. There are numerous instances, additionally, 
where so -called "AI" also creates and hallucinates information/data, and it is well known that 
LLMs cannot be restrained from reporting bad, inaccurate, or downright harmful content. Allowing unfettered use of AI, especially based on copyrighted materials used to train without permission or compensation, in any and all sectors of the United States stands to cause a veracity of damage yet unknown including collapsing creative endeavors and more. To think this technology could be used to make military decisions, medical decisions, and more is frankly horrifying and dystopian.
