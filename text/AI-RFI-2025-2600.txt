General Comment
The allowance of AI to m ake unrestrained use of copyrighted m aterials without expressed consent from  the copyright holder will lead to a
never ending cycle legal battles over fair use and the devaluation of value of said m aterial. It will function as poison to the m arket in which
any incentive to invest and gain a return on investm ent will be stigm atized. Businesses in particular will be hurt as their intellectual property
will lose a vital protection that keeps them  m arket com petitive.
It will lead to the destruction of innovation. Any use of AI m ust be tem pered with the respect of intellectual property rights. It is
unam erican in spirit to dem and oneâ€™s property be forced to be used by other individuals for free
