General Comment
The AI bubble is starting to burst and you’re giving these charlatans free rein to steal the hard work of people who actually create art?
Disney was able to sue children’s hospitals to rem ove drawings of Mickey Mouse. And these losers get a pass?
Aaron Swartz took his own life after a copyright lawsuit ruined his life. And you’re saying Open AI is above the law now?
The end goal of the AI gold rush is to fire as m any people as possible, freeing up even m ore m oney for the vultures at the top. Predatory
capitalist garbage at its m ost blatant. 
This is absolutely ridiculous.
