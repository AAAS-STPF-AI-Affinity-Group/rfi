General Comment
We cannot have a world where Generative AI is allowed to run am ok. It doesn't offer anything of value beyond the fact that the least
scrupulous am ong us will get to pillage from  other actual hard workers and parasitically leech off of them . Is this not a country that
cham pions personal responsibility and work that results from  the sweat off one's own brow? Why, then, would we allow people to steal
the tim e and effort of others to m ake this slop that contributes nothing?
All this will do is m ake the Am erican people even m ore of a laughing stock. Fools that allowed ourselves to be fooled by m achines that
siphon off others' work. We can't even do our own work? Now we m ust just eat anothers'filth like a hum an centipede of art and literature,
constantly getting worse and m ore incestuous results in the process? It's em barrassing that this is even considered. If we Am ericans are as
truly great as we say we are, we don't need to rely on technology that will only m ake us dum ber and lazier, lopping up reheated leftovers
that were hastily slam m ed together with no thought and nothing innovative to com e out of it.
