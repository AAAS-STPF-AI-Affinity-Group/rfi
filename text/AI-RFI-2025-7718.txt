General Comment
As a creative, the propagation of GenAI into the general public has m ade m e feel like m y livelihood is being threatened. Why strive to
becom e a better artist when m y superiors could just use an AI to replace m e? On top of that, I donâ€™t feel com fortable sharing m y art with
others in fear or it being stolen to be used to train AI. I would want to at least be able to opt-out, and at m ost be able to receive
com pensation for m y work being used
