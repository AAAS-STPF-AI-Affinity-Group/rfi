General Comment
Copywrite regulations on Artificial Intelligence m ust rem ain in place. The use of AI is a new and little-understood technology, and could
becom e a danger to the Am erican people if m ade free from  the laws in place that protect shareholders and m edia organizations, including
Fox, TikTok, Disney, and m any other com panies that define the United States and are im portant to our culture and history. I, as an
individual, and others like m e are held in contem pt by the ways that AI can be used, and has already been used, to deprive us of the jobs
that we, as hard-working Am ericans, rightly deserve. The proposal to free generative AI from  copywrite law is short-sighted and
downwrite preposterous to those of us who respect the contributions to technology that this great country has already m ade! I wish for the
people who m ake these laws reconsider their positions on this m atter, and prevent this action from  com ing to pass.
