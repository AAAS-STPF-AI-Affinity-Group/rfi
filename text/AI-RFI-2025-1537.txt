General Comment
I im plore the National Science Foundation to NOT m ove forward with letting tech com panies like Google and OpenAI break copyright
laws by training off of content they do not own, especially content that is legally protected. This will end up causing great harm  to m any
industries, especially in the creative sector where m any people are already displaced and trying to find work. Many have voiced concern
over their work being used to train m odels without their consent or any com pensation. We need to ensure that any protections put in
place, and that these tech giants should not abuse their power or influence. This is hardly a m atter of "national security". Copyright law
m ust be protected, otherwise irreparable dam age will be done to the econom y and nobody will have ownership of anything.
