I have been playing with ChatGBT for about a year and have done some very cool things with it. I 
asked it to sort my iPhone phots by facial recognition, I have used it to enhance my resumes, write 
performance reviews and draft policy documentation. That be ing said, I have also worked with it to 
create a database from webpages, and found that the data was roughly 70% accurate, probably 
because of the way the web pages are built. So I think in the beginning stages, you are going to need 
people like me with st rong analytical skills to keep it honest. I also think there needs to be people 
who work with it to enhance its sill learning on ethics. I am grateful to the President for taking away 
some of the red tape, but we are going to need an Army of volunteers or people that will continue to 
work with it, and be able to advise of course corrections when we discover something.
