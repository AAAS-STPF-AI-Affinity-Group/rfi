General Comment
GenAI is not *the future*; it is theft. It steals from  the livelihood of artists, and then creates profit off of that theft. Tech com panies have
created a specific category of large language m odels that are incredibly im practical, and useful only for stealing; in fact, they have openly
adm itted that they were only able to build GenAI LLMs by taking data from  online, without ever asking perm ission or giving credit. Now,
they are insisting that this specific type of LLM - ie, 'Generative AI' - is just as valid as other LLM breakthoughs, even though the *only*
way they can be profitable and useful is if their theft is m ade legal. This is a terrible idea, and they should not be given perm ission to steal.
