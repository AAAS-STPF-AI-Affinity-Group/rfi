Comment  on Request  for Information  on the Deve opment  of an Al Action Plan  
 
Lexset welcomes the opportunity to  respond to  the National Science Foundation's Request for 
Information (RFI) on  a National Al Action Plan. As a  leading developer of synthetic data and 
systems for artificial intelligence,  Lexset supports the Trump Administration's  focus on 
sustaining American Al leadership while removing unnecessary regulatory barriers, as 
embodied in  Executive Order 14179, "Removing Barriers to  American Leadership in Artificial  
Intelligence."  Our comments align closely with the administration's directive to enhance 
America's Al dominance in support of  economic competitiveness  and national security, and to 
ensure that overly burdensome requirements do not hamper private -sector innovation. We 
provide evidence of synthetic data's effectiveness and  cost benefits, discuss its  importance in 
the U.S.-China technological competition, describe  Lexset's  contributions through public -private 
partnerships, and recommend policies to  drive Al  innovation with minimal regulatory friction.  
 
2. Background  on Lexset  
 
Lexset  is a leader  in synthetic  data development,  harnessing advanced generative techniques 
to create high -fidelity, photorealistic datasets essential for training state -of-the-art Al models . 
Founded  in 2018  and based  in Brooklyn, NY  and Gig Harbor, WA,  Lexset is  backed  by top-tier 
investors such as  Super Ventures and XRC Labs, and has earned recognition as a Verizon 
"Built on 5G Challenge" winner.  
 
Our flagship platform, Seahaven , revolutionizes  synthetic data generation by combining 
graph -based scene creation, procedural simulation, and robust physics -based controls . This 
technology enables the rapid production of diverse training data across multiple sensor 
modalities -from Synthetic  Aperture  Radar  (SAR) and Radar to EO imagery -addressing 
critical data shortages that hamper traditional Al development. Lexset's approach not only 
accelerates the  training  process  but has been  shown  to improve object  detection accuracy by 
nearly threefold, making it indispensable for  both commercial and defense applications.  
 
Lexset has  successfully partnered with  leading technology companies and manufacturing 
companies, as well as  U.S. government agencies including the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. 
Space Force . Through partnerships - such as our engagements  via the National Security 
Innovation  Network (NSIN)  and various  DoD Small  Business programs  - we have  demonstrated 
how synthetic data can enhance autonomous systems, improve intelligence analysis, and 
support advanced operational scenarios . These collaborations have enabled rapid prototyping 
and deployment of Al solutions that drive down costs and reduce the need for extensive,  
real-world  data collection,  supporting  government  spending  efficiency.

By integrating cutting -edge synthetic data methodologies with  strong industry partnerships, 
Lexset  is uniquely positioned  to support the  U.S. government's strategic  objectives  of sustaining 
Al leadership, ensuring national security, and maintaining a  competitive edge against global 
rivals . Our commitment to innovation and  collaboration provides a powerful model for how 
public -private partnerships can transform Al R&D, accelerate technology transfer, and deliver 
robust, cost -effective solutions for defense and national security applications.  
 
2. The Role  of Synthetic  Data  in Al Development  for Defense and  National  Security  
 
Synthetic data has  emerged as  a critical  tool for  advancing Al. This  is especially true  in domains 
where real data is  scarce, unstructured  and unwieldy,  or costly to obtain. In  defense and 
national security applications, synthetic data enables the training and testing of  Al models for 
scenarios that are difficult or dangerous to  replicate. It  can augment or substitute for real -world 
data when the  latter  is unavailable or  exhausted .1 For example, the  U.S. Army has  identified that 
many Al/ML models in  the defense domain suffer from a "bottleneck" of training data; an Army 
program noted there is "not enough unique defense/intel data available to create highly 
performant models", and that synthetic data generation could alleviate this shortage.2 By 
generating realistic sensor feeds, images, or  simulations of  operational environments, synthetic 
data allows Al systems  to learn to recognize  threats  (e.g. vehicles, targets, or anomalies) 
without requiring massive real world datasets.  
 
These capabilities are already at work. In  a collaboration with the Air Force Research Lab, 
Lexset's photorealistic synthetic imagery was used to train computer vision algorithms for 
unmanned systems, boosting object detection accuracy and overall autonomous system 
performance. This demonstrates how simulated data of  battlefields or surveillance scenes can 
sharpen Al perception for warfighters . Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security has 
recognized synthetic data as a "gamechanger" that allows training Al when real data is  too 
sensitive or  not available .3 DHS's 2024 solicitation for synthetic data solutions highlights that 
synthetic data enables model  training while safeguarding privacy and  security, particularly for 
scenarios involving personally identifiable information. Across the  national security community, 
there  is growing consensus that  synthetic data  generation  through  simulation and  modeling is  a 
critical tool to create the large, varied datasets needed for robust Al applications.4 
 
3. Cost -Saving  Benefits  of Synthetic  Data  and Efficient  Al Development  
 
Synthetic data can significantly reduce the cost and time of  Al development, acting as  a force 
multiplier for government and industry resources. Traditional Al model training often requires 
collecting and  using  human  laborers to  annotate millions of  real-world data  points,  an expensive 
and labor -intensive process. In contrast, synthetic datasets are generated in virtual 
environments with  built-in ground  truth labels, eliminating much  of the manual  labeling  cost.  The

U.S. Army notes that creating a moderately accurate model might require on the order of 50 
million real data samples, whereas a synthetic data pipeline can produce unlimited labeled 
examples on  demand.5 By leveraging synthetic data,  agencies  can avoid  costly  data collection 
campaigns  and rapidly  produce  specialized datasets  (e.g. satellite images  of missile  launchers 
or radar signals of  targets) tailored to  their mission needs. There is  no need to wait months or 
years to  accumulate real -world examples of  every scenario. This on -demand data generation 
not only saves money but also accelerates development cycles.  
 
Moreover, synthetic data enables extensive pre -testing of  Al systems before real -world 
deployment,  catching potential issues early and cheaply . Models can be trialed against 
countless simulated edge cases (e.g., rare conditions, adversarial tactics, and  extreme 
environments) that  would  be logistically difficult or  expensive to  reproduce in  live exercises . This 
comprehensive  virtual testing improves reliability and safety, reducing the risk of  costly failures 
when new systems are fielded . 
 
In the defense context,  battlefield simulations can  ensure  Al-driven systems are  robust  against  a 
wide range of threat scenarios, thereby avoiding expensive fixes or  mission failures later.  
Industry analyses reinforce these benefits : synthetic data brings cost efficiency by cutting 
expenses associated  with real data collection, labeling,  and yields  time savings  by accelerating 
Al training and testing pipelines.  
 
In short,  every  dollar  invested in  high-quality synthetic data  can return  many  dollars  in saved 
labor, faster development, and  more reliable Al outcomes. Harnessing synthetic data thus 
supports government spending efficiency. Agencies retooling for future challenges like  the 
Department of  Defense and  the Department of Homeland Security can do more with 
constrained budgets, focusing funds on  critical  hardware or  personnel needs rather than  on 
protracted data -gathering efforts.  
 
4. Strategic Importance  of Synthetic  Data  in Maintaining U.S.  Al Leadership  
 
Maintaining America's lead in artificial intelligence is  not just an  economic issue but a national 
security  imperative, especially in  light of strategic  competition  with China.  The People's  Republic 
of China has declared its  ambition to become the world leader in  Al by 2030, backing this  goal 
with massive investments and state -driven Al programs . Chinese researchers have already 
surpassed their U.S. counterparts in  sheer volume of Al research publications in  recent years, 
and China's private sector and  government spending on  Al are growing rapidly.6 U.S. policy, as 
articulated in EO 14179, is well -directed to  "sustain and enhance America's global Al 
dominance" for the sake of economic and  national security .7 In this context, synthetic data is  a 
strategic asset that can help the United States outpace competitors in Al development.  
China's advantages in  Al often  stem  from its access to  vast amounts of  data and  a centrally 
coordinated national Al strategy. The U .S. can counter these advantages by  leveraging

innovation in  synthetic data to overcome our own data limitations. By generating unlimited 
training data virtually, American researchers and companies can overcome the  challenges in 
obtaining real data, leveling the playing field or even leapfrogging in  our competitor's 
capabilities. If  the U.S. leads  in synthetic data  generation technology, it  will lead in the ability to 
train the most advanced Al systems at scale.  
 
This has direct  national  security implications: superior  Al trained  on richer,  more  diverse  data will 
enhance  U.S. military  intelligence, autonomous platforms, and  decision -support  systems relative 
to those of other nations. Conversely, if  the U.S. falls behind, we  risk a world in  which Chinese 
standards and technologies dominate, a concern expressed by Congress and defense experts 
who note that Beijing is  aggressively pursuing leadership in Al and even international  Al 
standards -setting .8 American leadership in  synthetic data and Al  is thus essential to ensure that 
the values of openness, privacy, and human rights prevail over authoritarian models of Al  use. 
Synthetic data is strategic infrastructure  for Al superiority . By investing in  it, the United States 
can accelerate  innovation, maintain a  military -technological  edge,  and blunt  China's  attempts to 
gain Al dominance . 
 
5. Policy  Recommendations  for Advancing  Al Innovation  
 
In line with Executive  Order  14179's objectives, Lexset offers  the following  recommendations  to 
support U.S. Al leadership and innovation. These recommendations aim to foster Al 
development, particularly for defense applications, while minimizing regulatory burdens, thus 
enabling the U .S. to maintain its edge in  an increasingly competitive global Al landscape:  
 
I. Promote Synthetic Data Adoption Across Federal Al  Initiatives. Federal agencies 
should explicitly encourage and  fund the use of synthetic data in Al R&D, testing, and 
evaluation. This  could include directing R&D funding (via NSF, DoD, OHS S&T, etc.) 
toward synthetic data generation tools and establishing pilot programs where agencies 
partner with industry to  create synthetic datasets for high -priority Al challenges. By 
integrating synthetic data into  programs like  the DoD Joint Al  Center  initiatives, the  DoD 
Data Strategy, and NSF -funded research, the government can amplify Al  progress with 
limited real -world data. Agencies should develop standards and best practices for 
validation of synthetic data quality, as  highlighted by the DOD's National Science and 
Technology Council's 2023 strategy calling for research into verification techniques for 
synthetic data accuracy and effectiveness.9 Ensuring synthetic data is  rigorously 
evaluated will  build trust in  its use. We also recommend establishing a public synthetic 
data catalog or  sandbox (perhaps as  part of  the National Al Research Resource) where 
researchers and  companies can  access  government -curated  synthetic datasets (with  no 
privacy issues) for Al development. This would accelerate innovation across academia, 
industry, and government by making  "open synthetic data" a shared resource.

March  13, 2025   
II. Strengthen Opportunities for  Small  Businesses in  Defense Al  Innovation. The U.S. 
government should expand mechanisms that allow small innovative Al  companies to 
contribute to national security missions. Lexset's experience through small business 
contracts and  the NSIN accelerator suggests that relatively small  investments in  nimble 
businesses can yield outsized benefits by bringing cutting -edge tech into  government 
use. We urge the continuation and growth of programs like AFWERX, DIU (Defense 
Innovation Unit),  NSIN, and DHS's Silicon Valley Innovation Program, which connect 
non-traditional  vendors/startups  with defense and  security  needs.  Contracting processes 
should be further streamlined to lower barriers for small Al firms to work with the 
government (e .g., faster acquisition pathways, flexible intellectual property 
arrangements, and bridge funding between pilot  projects and full  adoption). By  lowering 
contracting and  compliance hurdles, the  government can  tap into the full creativity of  the 
private sector . We also recommend incentives for  large prime  contractors to  incorporate 
innovative subcontractors  in defense programs, fostering a collaborative ecosystem . 
Ultimately, robust public -private collaboration will  help ensure the U.S. military and 
homeland security agencies have access to the best Al technologies available 
domestically, reinforcing our technological and military dominance.  
 
Ill.  Leverage Synthetic Data to  Improve Government Efficiency and  Reduce  Costs.  As 
agencies implement Al solutions, they should prioritize cost -effective  strategies like 
synthetic data pre -testing. We recommend 0MB  and agency leadership issue guidance 
recognizing synthetic data as a best practice for Al project planning - for instance, 
requiring that proposals for new Al systems consider the use of synthetic data during 
development to optimize cost and  performance. By conducting extensive virtual 
experimentation, agencies can identify failures or biases in Al models without the 
expense  of live trials,  thus avoiding wasteful  spending . Successful case studies  (such  as 
the Army's use of  synthetic data to  overcome intel  data gaps)10 should  be shared across 
government to  illustrate return on investment. Making synthetic data a cornerstone of 
federal Al development  will maximize the impact per taxpayer dollar, enabling  
high-performance  Al systems without the  traditionally high  costs  of data acquisition and 
model training.  
 
IV. Maintain Light -Touch Regulation and Remove Barriers to  Al Deployment. We 
strongly support the intent of EO 14179 to eliminate or revise policies that needlessly 
hinder Al innovation. To this end, we  recommend reviewing and rescinding legacy 
regulations or  agency policies that inadvertently discourage data sharing or  Al adoption. 
The federal government should also coordinate with state and  local governments to 
discourage a  patchwork of  Al regulations; a  clear  national  standard  will help American Al 
companies innovate with  confidence. In  international contexts, U.S.  diplomats and  trade 
officials should push back against foreign regulations that unfairly disadvantage U.S.  Al 
products or  that seek to impose another country's values via technology standards . By 
championing a pro -innovation  regulatory climate at home and abroad, the U.S. can  
 
10 U.S. Army  SBIR  Topic  A214 -042: Sensor  Synthetic Data  Generation  (2021)  

March  13, 2025   
ensure that its Al developers (large and small) are not hamstrung by red tape, and that 
American Al systems reach the field faster to  compete globally. We also endorse 
continued  inter-agency efforts  to clarify  ethical  guidelines and  risk management practices 
for Al (building on NIST's work),  so that essential guardrails  are in place without 
imposing heavy -handed rules that deter experimentation.  
 
V. Prioritize  National  Security  Al R&D  and Leadership  Coordination. To secure 
long-term U.S. leadership,  federal  policy  should  treat Al, including  synthetic  data 
capabilities, as  a strategic priority  on par with other critical technologies. We  applaud the 
inclusion of national security considerations  in the Al Action Plan mandate, and we urge 
sustained focus on defense -related Al in  its implementation. Concretely, this means 
increasing investments in Al R&D for defense and dual -use technologies . It also means 
cultivating the Al talent and workforce needed for the defense sector, possibly by 
expanding scholarships and career pathways for Al engineers to enter public service or 
defense industry  roles. Another  aspect of  leadership  is international: the U.S. should 
lead alliances for  Al cooperation - sharing  data (including  synthetic data  techniques) and 
aligning Al ethics with allies  - to magnify our collective capabilities against adversaries. 
Finally, high -level coordination is  key. We recommend empowering the White House's 
science and technology leaders and the National Security Advisor (as named in  EO 
14179) to continually identify and remove any emerging "barriers to American Al 
leadership." This could involve quick action to address bottlenecks such as export 
controls on  certain Al hardware, immigration hurdles for Al talent, or  insufficient tech 
transfer out of federal labs . By proactively tackling such issues, the Administration can 
ensure nothing stands in  the way of U.S. technological and military dominance in  Al. A 
whole -of-government commitment to Al leadership - with defense innovation at its core  
- will signal  to both allies  and competitors that  the United States intends to  retain its 
preeminent position in Al for the foreseeable future.  
 
Lexset appreciates the opportunity to contribute to the formulation of the U.S . Artificial 
Intelligence Action Plan. Synthetic data is  a powerful enabler of Al advancement,  and with 
thoughtful policy support it can help drive breakthroughs in  defense, security, and  many civilian 
sectors while saving costs and safeguarding privacy . The United States stands at a pivotal 
moment. By  embracing innovation and  removing impediments, we  can unleash Al's potential to 
strengthen our  economy and  secure  our nation.  In drafting  the Action  Plan,  we urge NSF,  OSTP, 
and NITRO to incorporate the  above recommendations,  focusing on data -driven approaches, 
strategic investment, and  light-touch regulation,  which align with the mandate of  Executive 
Order 14179 to sustain American  Al leadership. Lexset remains committed to  partnering with 
the U.S. government to  achieve these goals. We  are prepared to  share further insights from our 
R&D efforts and to support initiatives that will ensure the United States continues to  lead in 
artificial intelligence against any competition. Together, government and  industry can create an 
environment where Al innovation flourishes on  American soil,  bolstering our  national security 
and prosperity for years to come.
