_____________
OpenAI is claim ing that without the rights to use copyrighted inform ation without paying a fee to the owner of this m aterial. 
They claim  that without this ability, they cannot com pete in the developm ent of AI. 
I do not believe this claim . 
They are m aking this claim  solely in order to avoid paying for the data. 
This provision would violate copyright law, for no reason. At the very least, the request should be granted by the courts, NOT through an
executive order.
