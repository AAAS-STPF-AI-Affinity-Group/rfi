If copyright is "pardoned" for generative AI programs (such as Open AI), this will be yet  
another example of the current US gov't destroying the small businesses that make up the heart  
and soul of the United States of America. These massive AI companies DO have the money to  
pay for licensing, but they don't want to. They simply want to ride roughshod on small  
creators and take whatever they desire, which then proceeds to directly compete with *us*
(using ingredients stolen from us) to run us out of business (because we don't have the  
resources to fight them), thereby decreasing the amount of human-made product they can
(hopefully legally) license, further down the line. Their goal to be cheap, greedy and  
indiscriminate is cruel and ugly, and will ultimately lead to failure. 
Please consider maintaining copyright to protect America's small businesses and independent  
creators! We are a country of brilliance, but we can't do that if we can't make a living, if we're  
beaten down by behemoth corporations.
