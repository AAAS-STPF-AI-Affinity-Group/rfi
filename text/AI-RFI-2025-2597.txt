General Comment
Generative AI is exploitative software designed to reproduce outputs from  its datasets. These datasets include copyrighted m aterial from  a
m yriad of sources—uncredited and uncom pensated from  unconsenting laborers.
By virtue of the nature of its developm ent and its function, it directly com petes against the very creatives whose works are required for it
to function. It has already negatively im pacted said creatives by forcing them  to work longer hours with fewer coworkers for less pay in
m ore standardized settings. It's also directly slashed pay and job opportunities for freelancers. Text-based genAI software also siphon
traffic from  the very sites whose inform ation they regurgitate.
In addition, m any tech com panies directly profit from  these software, whether from  donations from  larger com panies or from  subscription
services.
Because of this, it directly violates the Fair Use affirm ative defense. It's also why tech com panies keep insisting to change copyright law—
they're fully aware that it violates the civil rights of laborers from  m ultiple industries.
