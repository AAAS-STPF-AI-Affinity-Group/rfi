General Comment
As a consum er and artist, I am  against this request as training AI on copyrighted works disservices and violates copyright laws. It will
stripe away the copyright of works of organizations, individual artists, and sm all businesses, negatively affecting revenue and allowing a
m onopoly of works created by these entities to a sm all selection of AI corporations. Billions of dollars will be lost by this request as
training AI on copyrighted work sidelines revenue to those who m ake works like m ovies, art, TV Shows, and am ongst other works
created by hum an beings to AI corporations. Accepting this request will be gross negligence and a violation of copyright law, m aking
these protections to these works people have spent their lives on m eaningless. That any author of any work cannot claim  ownership due to
AI stealing their life's work.
