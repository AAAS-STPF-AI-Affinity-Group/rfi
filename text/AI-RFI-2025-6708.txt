General Comment
OpenAi hurts people, businesses, com panies and partnerships. Records show that usage of Ai for self-prom otional reasons and
replacem ent of other people’s services has lost them  m ore m oney than m aking it. The m ore you shove this into our faces, the less people
will be willing to work for other com panies; and when their businesses are at the brink of shutting down, they won’t be hearing back from
the people they’ve stolen from . Desperation leads to oblivion.
