Good day Mr. D'Souza,
This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains nobusiness-proprietary or confidential information. Document contents may be reused bythe government in developing the AI Action Plan and associated documents withoutattribution.
I strongly recommend reinstating executive order 14110 from Oct 30, 2023.
  Policy
should also reinforce protections and privacy for users, ensure high ethical practices.  
All of this should be based in diversity, equity, and inclusivity values that protect our
citizens from white supremist propaganda, racist values, homophobic mentalities, andsexist practices.
 
The AI action plan should LIMIT industry's ability to access personal information andgovernmental documents (such as social security numbers, health history, etc).
  AI
should also be based in sound scientific facts as well as sociological principals thathave been vetted by experts in those fields.
  There should be a non-partisan, non-
corporate entity that monitors the scope and reach of AI in our systems.
Thank you for your consideration,
Laurie Allen-Requa
