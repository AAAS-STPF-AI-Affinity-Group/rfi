General Comment
The corporations running this country are stealing from  the com m on citizens non-stop. Wage theft, artificial inflation, subscription schem es,
insurance scam s. Now they're trying to m ake it legal to take our intellectual property and m ake us pay for it as consum ers. How do they
not understand that there's only so m uch to take. Without workers to m ake their products or custom ers to buy them  to they have no
business. No business m eans no new yacht to m atch your new vacation com pound. No new m istresses to m ake you feel big. Just a
handful of assholes left in a circle jerk of "power".
Stop the stealing.
