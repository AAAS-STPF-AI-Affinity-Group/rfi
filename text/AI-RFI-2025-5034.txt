General Comment
OpenAI and all AI startups are essentially con jobs propped up by speculative m arkets. We've seen this sam e phenom enon the last
couple of years with cryptocurrency and NFTs. The com panies are prom ising things that are not true and cannot be true--there will never
be "general AI," and m any of the supposed applications for this technology in, for exam ple, national security, are unreliable at best and
actively harm ful at worst. It is painfully easy to exploit AI algorithm s, and incorporating them  into law enforcem ent will only m ake it easier
for crim inals to get away with m urder.
As a writer, OpenAI exploits m y work without perm ission. This is bad for m y business. It is bad for the Am erican econom y. It is bad for
national security, law enforcem ent, sm all businesses, academ ia, and every level of governm ent. If we continue to let AI com panies do as
they please, it will be disastrous for the econom y when this bubble inevitably pops.
