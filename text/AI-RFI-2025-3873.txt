General Comment
This bill is a slap in the face to Am erican artists who already have it difficult enough to live in the current landscape. Generative AI has
absolutely no place in the future of Am erica and will serve only to m ake living m ore difficult for the average Am erican. This bill is an affront
to everything Am erica has m ade its nam e for.
