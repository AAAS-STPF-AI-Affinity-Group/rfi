General Comment
As an author video gam e writer, and that is harder work than m ost people realize. Com pared to m y years working on m y feet as a
waitress and as a bouncer and later in construction, the hours are longer and the training a lot m ore difficult.
Stealing all that hard work from  m e to train a robot that can’t even throw together a decent story isn’t just theft, it’s stupid. The
governm ent is letting a fast-talking, slim y conm an rob the public.
