General Comment
It's a genuine safety risk to have corporations have access to train AI on literally anything they want. Artists, authors and other creative
fields will lose m ore m oney than they already have. There will be even m ore m isinform ation around and the further norm alization of
generative AI is going to create unintelligent people. If these com panies can't create a good product with guardrails that protect people
m aybe it's not a product worth using.
