General Comment
AI technology m ust respect creators and honor copyright laws to sustain innovation and fairness. When AI m odels train on protected
works without consent, they exploit creators' intellectual property and underm ine their ability to earn a living from  their art and expertise.
Ethical AI practices dem and transparency, perm ission-based usage, and proper com pensation (for future AND past theft of content),
safeguarding both creativity and technological advancem ent. Protecting creators' rights is essential to building a fair, innovative digital
future.
Google, OpenAI and the likes have gutted sm all Am erican business through the theft of copyrighted m aterials. Creators m ust be protected
and the current United States copyright laws m ust be enforced. Google Search and AI m odels have system atically harvested copyrighted
m aterials from  across the internet without creators' consent, reusing and repackaging original content for their own profit. This
unauthorized scraping and regurgitation directly underm ines creators, stripping them  of web traffic, revenue, and recognition. Thousands of
independent creator businesses—bloggers, photographers, artists, and writers—have collapsed because their original works,
painstakingly developed through tim e and expertise, are now freely given out and m onetized by big tech com panies. To protect the
integrity of creative labor, it's im perative to enforce stringent copyright protections and hold com panies accountable, restoring creators'
rights and preserving the foundation of digital entrepreneurship.
