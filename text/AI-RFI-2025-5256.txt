General Comment
AI is an expensive and destructive fad that will fizzle soon. It aids in plagiarism  and contributes nothing but stolen garbage to the
inform ation ecosystem . Changing current laws to accom m odate the wishes of AI corporations will hurt creatives and contribute nothing
positive to anyone . AI should be regulated, not encouraged, and it should NOT be given im m unity from  copyright law.
