General Comment
AI needs regulation and oversighht to prevent theft of intellectual property and to protect the livelihood of original artists and creative
talent. AI in fields like technology and m edicine serves a purpose to accelerate research and developm ent. Generative AI is unable to
produce results without stealing from  original art and published works, which m eans it violates copyright and tradem ark laws in regards to
im itation products, licensing, and unauthorized reproduction. It is plagiarism .
Even AI like Watson assistant or Microsoft co-pilot is a danger to the lower-m iddle-class workforce and is often riddled with errors and
no corrective workarounds. This will deter productivity, not enhance it, and produce substandard results. I firm ly object to all uses of AI
in creative, adm inistrative, and all other applications that are unnecessary to inject such incom petent software.
