Re: AI Action Plan—Comments for the Office of Science and Technology Policy 
To the National Science Foundation, 
My name is Ryan Abbott, I am Professor of Law and Health Sciences at University of 
Surrey School of Law, Adjunct Associate Professor of Medicine at the David Geffen 
School of Medicine at University of California Los Angeles, Partner at Brown, Neri, Smith & Khan, LLP, and a neutral at JAMS, Inc.  
I have published extensively on AI and law in top peer-reviewed legal, medical, and 
scientific books and journals, including as the author of The Reasonable Robot: 
Artificial Intelligence and the Law  published in 2020 by Cambridge University Press, 
the editor of the Research Handbook on Intellectual Property and Artificial 
Intelligence published in 2022 by Edward Elgar, a co-author of the 
textbook International Intellectual Property in an Integrated World Economy, Fifth 
Edition published in 2024 by Aspen Publishing, and a co-editor of the Concise Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence and the Law  forthcoming by Edward Elgar in 
2026. My academic work has been cited more than 3,000 times. I am a licensed physician and patent attorney in the United States, and a solicitor advocate in England and Wales. 
The Request for Information seeks input on the highest priority policy actions that 
should be in the new AI Action Plan, including as relates to intellectual property policy. 
My response argues that it is critical for U.S. law to allow intellectual property rights to subsist in AI-generated outputs. Doing so is vital for America’s AI industrial strategy and its international competitiveness with respect to AI development.  
In 2022, the Federal Circuit held that an AI-generated invention was categorically unprotectable by patent rights. Thaler v. Vidal, 43 F.4th 1207, 1210 (Fed. Cir. 2022). I 
was lead counsel in this case. Subsequently, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has 


2 created a complex and detailed guidance on the level of human input required for AI 
output to be patentable.1  
This legal regime runs contrary to the purpose of patent law, which is intended to incentivize invention, promote the disclosure of trade secrets, and encourage the 
commercialization of inventions. Allowing patent protection on AI-generated inventions would further this purpose to the benefit of the American public by incentivizing the 
development and use of AI in R&D in ways that will result in massive social gains—
including in areas like pharmaceutical development and clean energy. By contrast, prohibiting patents on AI-generated inventions means that even if AI can do a better job 
than a natural person at performing certain types of inventive activity, innovators will 
be discouraged from using AI. It also increases the uncertainty associated with patent protection and is likely to result in litigation to attempt to invalidate patents based on 
inventorship.  
Similarly, the U.S. Copyright Office has had a policy of refusing to register copyright in 
AI-generated works since at least 1973. This contrasts with jurisdictions such as the 
United Kingdom which do provide protection for such works.  
This policy is the result of an agency engaging in extra-sta tutory policy making. The 
Copyright Act does not require any traditional sort of human creativity for a work to be protected. In fact, the Copyright Act has, for more than a century, allowed non-natural 
persons in the form of corporations to be authors. In cases in which a corporation is an 
author, there is no requirement to disclose a natural person author or any contribution by a natural person. Similarly, there is no requirement to disclose a natural person author in 
cases of anonymous or pseudonymous works.  
Despite this, the Copyright Office has relied on dicta from cases from the Gilded Age to 
support their policy that a very particular sort of human creativity is needed for 
protection. This policy runs counter to the purpose of copyright law, which our Supreme Court has repeatedly held exists to promote the creation and dissemination of creative 
works. Copyright law does not exist to directly benefit authors, except as a means to an 
end—the end being the American public enjoying a vibrant creative economy. Denying copyright protection for AI-generated works acts as a major disincentive to the 
development and use of AI in the creative industries.  
I am also lead counsel in Thaler v Perlmutter, No. 23-5233, currently pending before 
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In that case, the Copyright Office rejected a 
copyright registration application for an AI-generated work on the basis that it lacked traditional human authorship. The Court of Appeals has yet to rule, but a district court 
upheld the Copyright Office’s rejection.  
I have included two academic articles with these comments that explain the importance 
of protecting AI-generated output with intellectual property rights to Amer ica’s AI

The author declares 
competing interests; see 
go.nature.com3sdvgzzAI-rich fields, such as drug discovery, are 
impeded by a global mishmash of rules on whether such innovations are patentable.
When I began the Artificial Inventor Pro -
ject in 2017, there were essentially no laws 
on inventions generated using artificial 
intelligence (AI) for drug discovery and 
repurposing, for example. But biomedical 
companies and researchers were already concerned about 
how patent law would handle such innovations.
The project was meant to promote dialogue and provide 
guidance. I manage a team of attorneys working pro bono 
to file patent applications in 18 jurisdictions worldwide 
for two inventions generated by US researcher Stephen 
Thaler’s AI system DABUS. Thaler is the owner on the pat-
ent applications on which DABUS is listed as inventor. In 
the cases heard so far, the results have been a mixed bag.
In March, I presented arguments to the UK Supreme 
Court in a case that will decide whether AI-generated 
inventions are patentable under UK law. I was also the lead 
attorney in a US case in which the applications were denied. 
The US Supreme Court turned down our appeal in April, 
making the country one of a handful that prohibits patents 
on AI-produced inventions.
This outcome could seriously hamper innovation 
in biomedicine. AI’s contributions to research and 
development might help to solve some of humanity’s 
oldest challenges, including by finding new treatments 
for diseases. The patent system must be overhauled.
An AI system is not a legal person, so it cannot (and 
should not) own property. Our cases have nothing to do 
with ‘ AI rights’ — they are about what rules will maximize 
the social benefits of AI and minimize its risks.
The main purposes of the patent system are to encourage 
innovation, the disclosure of inventions that would other -
wise be kept as trade secrets and the commercialization 
of new products. These outcomes could be achieved by 
allowing patent protection for AI-generated inventions, 
which would be owned by the AI’s owner, just as the owner 
of a 3D printer would also own what comes out of it.
Patents are probably more important in biotechnology 
than in any other field of commercial activity. The cost of 
developing a drug varies, but can run from hundreds of mil -
lions to billions of US dollars. Patents are crucial, because 
they allow developers a period of market exclusivity and 
thus a greater return on investment.
Unfortunately, inventorship is one of the least consistent 
standards in a mostly harmonized global patent system. In 
the United States, for example, a patent inventor must have 
a definite idea about the complete and operative invention, enough to enable another researcher to put it into practice. 
A few jurisdictions, including some member states of the 
European Patent Office, do not require an inventor to be a 
person. Others, including Austria and Israel, do not require a 
patent application to disclose an inventor at all. A Comment 
in Nature  last year argued that AI-generated inventions need 
their own international treaty, in part to deal with this dis -
cord (see A. George and T. Walsh Nature 605 , 616–618; 2022).
A programmer who builds a generative AI to find a new 
antibody, for example, might not meet the US definition 
of a patent inventor, if they are not the end user of the AI. A 
chemist who uses an AI might claim inventorship in some 
jurisdictions as the first person who recognized the AI’s 
output as valuable. But an AI might also identify its own 
output as useful — for example, if it identifies a new vir -
tual molecule with some predicted functionality — even 
though its user might not understand why the molecule 
has certain functions.
Today, people generally remain involved in the use of AI 
in drug discovery and repurposing, but that will increas -
ingly change. An AI can already evaluate its own output 
for fitness — for example, by generating new antibody 
sequences and modelling their binding affinity to a particu -
lar antigen on a protein — and its abilities will only improve. 
Disclosing AI inventorship promotes transparency about 
how inventions are generated and prevents someone from 
taking undeserved credit for work that they have not done.
Critics sometimes argue that patent policy should not 
encourage AI-generated inventions, because it is meant 
to benefit human inventors. But even though patents can 
benefit individual inventors, it is ultimately the public 
who benefits the most. It makes no difference whether an 
improved treatment for COVID-19 comes from a human 
pharmacologist or an AI. Even today, most patents are owned 
by artificial ‘individuals’ , mostly the companies, universities 
and governments that employ or fund human researchers.
The Artificial Inventor Project has laid bare a jurisdic -
tional split over how AI-generated inventions are treated. 
Patents have been denied in the United States, Australia 
and Taiwan, but South Africa issued one that has an AI listed 
as the inventor and its owner as the patent owner, as Saudi 
Arabia is expected to do. The European Patent Office has 
noted that although an AI cannot be named as an inventor, 
nothing prevents its user or owner from listing themselves 
instead and disclosing that an invention is AI-generated. 
Germany’s intermediate federal court has ruled similarly.
In the United States, it falls to Congress to fix this state of 
affairs by amending the Patent Act. In June, I testified before 
a US Senate subcommittee, in a hearing on whether AI-gen -
erated inventions should be protected. Congress must act, 
to preserve the nation’s competitiveness and ensure that 
the fruits of AI-led research can benefit people worldwide.Allow patents on

1141DISRUPTING CREA TIVITY: COPYRIGHT LAW IN THE AGE OF 
GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
Ryan Abbott* & Elizabeth Rothman** 
Abstract 
Over the last few years, due largely to breakthroughs in deep learning 
technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to step into the shoes 
of human content generators and mak e valuable creative works at scale. 
Before the end of the decade, a significant amount of art, literature, music, 
software, and web content will likely be created by AI rather than 
traditional human authors. Yet  the law lags behind this technological 
evolution by prohibiting copyright protection for AI -generated works. 
The predominant narrative holds that even if AI can automate creativity, 
this activity is not the right s ort of thing to protect, and that protection 
would even harm human artists.  
AI-generated works challenge beliefs about human exceptionalism 
and the normative foundations of copyright law, which until now have 
offered something for everyone. Copyright can be about ethics and authors and protecting the sweat of a brow and personality rights. 
Copyright can also be about the public interest and offering incentives to 
create and disseminate content. But copyright cannot have it all with AI authors—there is valuable output being generated, but by authors with no 
interests to protect.  
This Article argues that American copyright law is, and has 
traditionally been, primarily about benefiting the public interest rather than benefiting authors directly. As a result, AI -generated works are 
precisely the sort of thing the system aims to protect. Protection will 
encourage people to develop and use creative AI which will result in the 
production and dissemination of new works. Taken further, attributing 
authorship to AI that functionally does the work of a traditional author will promote transpa rency, efficient allocations of rights, and even 
counterintuitively protect human authors. AI -generated works also 
promise to radically impact other fundamental tenets of copyright law such as infringement, protection of style, and fair use. How the law 
should respond to AI activity has lessons more broadly for thinking about 
what rules should apply to people, machines, and other sorts of artificial 
authors.

INTRODUCTION  
The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the creative economy has 
changed dramatically.1 Due to advances in computing power and 
software designs, as well as the growth of big data useful for training 
machine learning -based algorithms, AI has evolved from assisting to 
automating the creative process.2 Moreover, AI is now stepping into the 
shoes of content generators and creating valuable original content in a

commercially relevant way.3 Before the end of the decade, a significant 
amount of art, literature, news stories, music, software, and web content 
will likely be AI-generated.4  
This technological evolution will result in seismic social and 
economic impact.5 It will prove equally disruptive to the law,6 including 
in the field of intellectual property (IP).7 AI behaving like a person raises 
numerous challenges in all areas of IP; and with copyright, it has now become critically important to resolve how legally to treat creative work made by a machine: can an AI -generated work receive copyright 
protection? Who  would own the copyright? Who, or what, would be the 
author? Is it copyright infringement to use protected works to train algorithms or to create AI-generated works?  
These questions have been explored in academic literature for 
decades.
8 Most commentators believe that AI -generated works should not 
receive protection, either for moral reasons —because AI -generated 
works are not the right sort of thing to protect —or for economic ones —
because AI does not respond to financial incentives to create output, because protection is unnecessary for other reasons, or because there are

to continue to increase. For example, there are now AI applications that can write movie scripts,software and music, and draw animation with little human input beyond the development of t he

greater costs associated with protection.9 More practically, the U .S. 
Copyright Office (USCO) has implemented a “Human Authorship 
Requirement” since at least 1973 that has prohibited the registration of 
copyright for AI -generated works.10 While the Copyright Act does not 
explicitly state that an author must be a human being, or that human 
creativity is a requirement for copyright, there is a long history of 
jurisprudence framing creativity in human -centric terms.11 There is no 
case law, at least in the United States, involving copyright protection of an AI-generated work.
12 Although, it should be noted that other types of 
artificial authors —artificial persons largely in the form of corporations 
and sovereign nations —have qualified as authors under the Copyright 
Act for over a century.13 
This Article argues that AI- generated works should receive copyright 
protection because they are precisely the sort of things designed to be protected. Copyright law, while often framed in terms of benefiting 
authors, has primarily broader and more utilitarian social goals: 
promoting the generation and dissemination of works.
14 While critics are 
of course correct that AI is not motivated to work by the prospect of 
copyright protection, that argument is a straw man. Rather than 
motivating machines directly, copyright protection will motivate people upstream of the creative act to  use and develop AI that will result in more 
production and dissemination of works.
15 
This Article goes further to claim that AI should be recognized as an 
author for copyright purposes. Doing so is not a matter of providing legal 
rights to machines. An AI is not a legal person and cannot have rights or 
obligations, and the costs of providi ng rights to AI would likely outweigh 
any potential benefits.16 Rather, accepting AI authors would promote

transparency, appropriate entitlement, and policymaking. Identifying AI 
authors would even protect the moral rights of human authors. Allowing 
someone to take credit for work done by an AI would not be unfair to the 
AI because the AI has no self -interest (or interests at all), but it would be 
unfair to other hum an authors. It would equate legitimate human 
creativity with someone simply asking an AI to perform a task.  
The remainder of this Article proceeds in three parts. Part I explores 
the state of the art in AI and the rapid development and acceleration of 
generative AI technologies. Part II examines copyright law in the context 
of AI-generated works. Part III argues  that both the protection of AI -
generated works and AI authorship are consistent with the primary goals 
of copyright law, and it considers how AI -generated works will impact 
other areas of copyright law.  
In considering AI authorship, this Article explores foundational legal 
questions. Does copyright exist primarily to benefit authors or the public? 
Does copyright exist to protect moral rights or to solve market failures? 
Until the advent of AI authors, there was less need to resolve these questions because copyright is pluralistic. Copyright law can be framed 
in terms of aiding certain types of authors, even if its financial benefits 
flow disproportionately to corporate interests.
17 But AI authorship forces 
choices to be made about copyright that have implications in other areas, 
including for infringement, fair use, and the protectability of style. It also 
has important implications for the law generally: how the law should 
accommod ate advances in technology, the role of purposive versus 
textual statutory interpretation, and whether the law should discriminate 
between human and AI behavior.

years since its introduction.18 This Article defines AI as an algorithm or 
machine capable of completing tasks that would otherwise require 
cognition.19  
AI is also categorized in terms of general AI versus narrow (or 
specific) AI. Narrow AI refers to current technologies that perform a dedicated purpose, while general AI refers to a hypothetical future AI 
capable of performing any (or nearly any) intellect ual task a person 
could.
20 For example, AI exists that can operate a vehicle,21 but that same 
AI could not play a game of chess without someone separately programming it with that capability.
22 Of course, narrow AI exists on a 
spectrum.23 A relatively narrow AI system might only be capable of 
optimizing a car suspension, while a less narrow system might be capable of optimizing a range of industrial components.
24 Plus, even narrow AI 
can have super -human capabilities. For instance, AI can now outperform 
people at every traditional board game25 and it is working hard at 
dominating video games.26 This year has proved AI to be a powerhouse

tool for generating creative content, too.27 Experts are divided on when, 
or if, general AI will exist.28 Some thought leaders, such as Ray 
Kurtzweil, believe that it will not be long until an AI exists that can 
broadly operate at human -like intellectual levels which will allow AI to 
improve its own capabilities and will lead to exponential improvement.29  
While a wide variety of AI structures are used in modern commercial 
products, commercial services, and some hybrid architectures, machine 
learning-based models for AI authors now dominate the AI landscape.30 
Machine learning is based on “the idea that systems can learn from data, 
identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human 
intervention.”31 Many AI algorithms, particularly those used in deep 
learning systems, are capable of self -improvement and automation of 
their own refinement.32 The key element of these algorithms or AI models 
is their ability to learn and adapt, as they are fed large amounts of data in 
the training process and adjust their internal parameters, known as 
weights, to improve their output’s match with desired result s.33 The 
weights of a trained machine learning model are essentially a set of 
numeric values that the model uses to make predictions or decisions.34 
Many of the recent advances in AI functionality have come because 
of improvements to machine learning systems driven by improvements in software design, hardware capabilities, and increased access to data

used to train such systems.35 These advances have led to the development 
of systems like AlphaGo and AlphaFold that have been able to master the 
complex game of Go and determine a protein’s 3D shape from its amino -
acid sequence, respectively .36 These breakthroughs were possible 
because of massive R&D investments.37 The pace of innovation has been

B.AI-Assisted vs. AI-Generated Creativity
Many of the terms in the world of AI creativity, like AI itself, lack 
standardized definitions. “Generative art” is an industry term used without focus on authorship or copyright law, and it typically refers to a 
work made, in whole or part, using an autonomous system (i.e., a system automating a task).
39 Generative art does not entirely mesh with terms 
like “AI-assisted” and “AI -generated,” which are also used to refer to 
works created using AI but more often in legal than creative contexts.40 
Even within legal settings, these terms are not used consistently, which is 
a significant issue for regulators drafting rules for works created using

2023] DISRUPTING CREATIVITY  1149 
AI.41 This is because there are greater risks of inadvertently 
unharmonized rules in different jurisdictions and of rules being 
developed without a clear understanding of their underlying regulatory 
subject matter. A camera filter and an autonomous text generat or such as 
ChatGPT pose different challenges.42 
This Article uses the term “AI -assisted work” to mean a work created 
using AI for which a natural person, and not AI, functionally qualifies as 
an author of the work under traditional criteria. AI/human -generated 
work means a work functionally co -authored by an AI and a human 
being. The term “AI- generated” refers to a work created using AI where 
no natural person qualifies as an author under traditional criteria. As discussed further below, under current USCO policies, AI -generated 
works are ineligible for copyright registration, while AI -assisted work s 
are eligible for copyright registration, with only the human -generated 
portion of an AI/human -generated work eligible for copyright 
protection.
43  
This definition of AI -generated work is consistent with the definition 
of “computer -generated work” in the United Kingdom’s Copyright, 
Designs and Patents Act.44 The United Kingdom was the first country to 
explicitly provide statutory copyright protection for such works, which it 
has done since 1988.45 For an AI- generated work, the “person by whom 
the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken”46

is legally deemed (or fictionalized) to be the author. In other words, the 
law treats the producer of the work as the legal author, even though they 
are not the factual author. The work then gets a shortened period of 
statutory protection: fifty years from the date of creation, rather than 
seventy years , plus the life of an author for human -generated works.47 It 
would be difficult to base the term of protection on the life of an AI that 
never dies (and never lives). 
The line between AI-assisted and AI-generated works is often blurry. 
Generative art, for example, has a long history dating back to at least the 
1960s, when Vera Molnár and Georg Nees used software to infuse 
controlled randomness into their artwork.48 In the 1960s and 1970s, 
generative art became more mainstream when abstract painter Harold 
Cohen created AARON, a machine that could first draw and then paint 
with little —if any —intervention.49 Modernly, text -to-image art -
generating models capable of creating artistic and photorealistic images 
from natural language inputs, such as DALL·E 2, Midjourney, and 
Firefly, are publicly available.50 A user types a text prompt and the AI 
uses the words to create an image that matches the text.51 Text-prompted 
image generation has raised significant questions regarding how much creative input is necessary for authorship,
52 so much so that the USCO 
has been holding listening sessions on the topic53 and has published

guidance on submitting works created with AI -generated material for 
copyright protection.54 The guidance has controversially required 
applicants to disclose AI -generated content in applications, and “AI -
generated content that is more than de minimis  should be explicitly 
excluded from the application.”55  
In 2022, Cosmopolitan Magazine (Cosmo) used DALL·E 2 to design 
what they claimed was the first ever magazine cover created by AI.56 The 
magazine’s editorial staff tried numerous text prompts that generated 
images the staff rejected, until the prompt “wide -angle shot from below 
of a female astronaut with an athletic feminine body walking with 
swagger toward camera on Mars in an infinite universe, synthwave digital 
art” was successfully used to create a cover image.57  
The cover of the magazine states that the image took only twenty 
seconds to make.58 While this is true of the initial image generation, it 
does not tell the full story of the cover’s creation. As mentioned, a human 
team spent time experimenting with different prompts.59 Also, once an 
image was selected, an unreleased experimental feature was used to 
improve the overall composition by manipulating the proportions of the 
image.60 The human team then went on to design the rest of the magazine 
cover.61 As digital artist Karen Cheng noted, “[t]his sure is a lot of human 
effort for an AI -generated magazine cover.”62 It is unclear who, if anyone, 
is an author of the Cosmo cover image. According to the USCO’s 
guidance, Cosmo is now required to disclose the use of AI in a 
registration and the USCO might deny registration for the image 
entirely.63 But imagine that no AI had been used in the making of the

image and that a human editor had given an in-house artist prompts for a 
cover image design. The editor gives numerous prompts, rejecting each image the artist subsequently produces, until finally the editor provides 
the same text prompt given to DALL·E 2, and the human artist produces 
the same image. The human artist would certainly be an author.
64 But 
what about the editor, or the person who then modified the author’s image 
for the magazine cover?  
In practice, copyright authorship disputes are usually highly fact 
dependent, based on who did what, and when.65 The predominant view is 
that to qualify as an author, each co -author must make an independently 
copyrightable contribution.66 Copyright protects the original expression 
of an idea, but not the idea underlying a work.67 Whether the editor would 
be a joint author thus depends on whether the text prompt is considered 
the expression of an idea or just an idea subsequently expressed by the artist.
68 Different cases with similar facts sometimes have held an editor 
to be an author and sometimes have not.69 However, the subsequent 
formatting work is unlikely to qualify anyone for joint authorship.70 
C.Types of AI-Generated Works
Contemporary AI systems can generate written, visual, and auditory 
creative content —with little to no human input —that is indistinguishable 
from works created by people.71 As discussed above in the Cosmo 
example, a text -to-image generator such as DALL·E 2 can create an 
deposit, and Mr. Allen’s correspondence, the Board concludes that the Work contains an amount 
of AI-generated material that is more than de minimis  and thus must be disclaimed. Specifically, 
the Board concludes that the Midjourney Image, which remains in substantial form in the final 
Work, is not the product of human authorship.”) .

image within seconds with just a text prompt.72 Like a human artist who 
may have taken years to perfect their artistic style by observing other 
artists, generative AI systems learn to create original works after being 
trained on data including text and images.  DALL·E 2 was trained on over 
650 million image and text pairs.73 This AI is not just copying other 
images or combining images together —researchers found a way to help 
the AI model understand context. Through a process called Aesthetic 
Quality Comparison, OpenAI, the company responsible for ChatGPT and DALL·E 2,
74 trained a model to predict human aesthetic judgments using 
a large video dataset.75 This allows DALL·E 2 to design a piece of art 
consistent with how, generally, humans perceive the world.76 This is, of 
course, different than the AI itself perceiving the world in the same way 
as people.77  
DALL·E 2 and other hyper -realistic image -generating models were 
initially restricted to research purposes or only available to a very limited audience with strict terms of use due to concerns about malicious actors 
misusing the technology.
78 In August 2022, Stability AI released Stable 
Diffusion, a model similar to DALL·E 2, but open source with the 
mission of democratizing access to these historically gatekept 
technologies.79 Since that time, the number of models and access to the 
public has increased dramatically.80 AI is even capable of developing 
images autonomously by combining language and image generating models. For example, Botto is an AI artist that autonomously creates and 
presents 350 pieces of art every week without human intervention.
81 
Botto creates its own text prompts, titles, and even artwork descriptions;

Despite years of academic commentary on the protectability of AI -
generated works, until very recently, there has never been a case in the United States either alleging copyright infringement of an AI -generated 
work or challenging the Copyright Office’s Human Authorship Requirement.
105 There are a few possible reasons for this. It may be that 
copyright applicants obtained registrations without disclosing their works 
were AI-generated, and litigants may have prosecuted claims without the 
origins of their works coming to light.106 Perhaps more likely, the lack of

case law is due to AI -generated works having lacked value. While an AI 
making a mediocre song may be an exciting technical landmark, if that 
song is not going to generate meaningful streaming revenue, there is little 
point in incurring significant legal expenses to litigate over copyright.  
Thaler v. Perlmutter107 is part of the Artificial Inventor Project.108 The 
project, led by Ryan Abbott, one of this Article’s coauthors, is  
a series of pro bono legal test cases seeking intellectual 
property rights for AI -generated output in the absence of a 
traditional human inventor or author. It is intended to 
promote dialogue about the social, economic, and legal 
impact of frontier technol ogies such as AI and to generate 
stakeholder guidance on the protectability of AI -generated 
output.109 
In 2019, the Copyright Office refused to register an AI -generated 2D 
artwork—A Recent Entrance to Paradise —created by an AI named the 
Creativity Machine.110 The applicant, Stephen Thaler, applied to register 
the work as its owner because he is the owner, user, and developer of the 
Creativity Machine.111 After the work was rejected, Thaler filed two 
requests for reconsideration appealing the refusal, and, on February 14, 2022, the Copyright Office finally affirmed the rejection in a final agency action.
112 The main justification for the denial of registration was that the 
work lacked a human author.113 The Review Board concluded, “[H]uman 
authorship is a prerequisite to copyright protection in the United States and . . . the Work therefore cannot be registered.”
114 In June 2022, Thaler

the work with the Creativity Machine  listed as the author and with Thaler 
as the owner of the copyright.115  
While this copyright case was ongoing, independent applicants had 
been testing the system by attempting to register works created using text -
to-image generators. One artist, Kristina Kashtanova, registered a comic 
book called Zarya of the Dawn , with images created using the generative 
AI system Midjourney.116 The USCO initially registered the work on 
September 15, 2022.117 However, after Kashtanova announced the 
registration of a work created using Midjourney on social media, the 
USCO subsequently contacted them asking for details about the use of 
AI in the creation of the work and notified them that the Office was 
considering cancelling the registration.118 On February 21, 2023, the 
USCO announced: 
The Office has completed its review of the Work’s original 
registration application and deposit copy, as well as the relevant correspondence in the administrative record. We conclude that Ms. Kashtanova is the author of the Work’s text as well as the selec tion, coordination, and arrangement 
of the Work’s written and visual elements. That authorship is protected by copyright. However, as discussed below, the images in the Work that were generated by the Midjourney technology are not the product of human auth orship. 
Because the current registration for the Work does not 
disclaim its Midjourney -generated content, we intend to 
cancel the original certificate issued to Ms. Kashtanova and 
issue a new one covering only the expressive material that she created.

Following the decision on the registration of Zarya of the Dawn , on 
March 16, 2023, the USCO released “Copyright Registration Guidance:

is a bedrock requirement of copyright.”121 Judge Beryl A. Howell, citing 
Goldstein v. California , acknowledged that the “Plaintiff correctly 
observes that throughout its long history, copyright law has proven 
malleable enough to cover works created with or involving technologies 
developed long after traditional media of writings memorialized on paper.”
122 However, Judge Howell declined to extend protection to works 
created autonomously by AI, stating:  
Copyright is designed to adapt with the times. Underlying 
that adaptability, however, has been a consistent 
understanding that human creativity is the sine qua non at 
the core of copyrightability, even as that human creativity is channeled through new tools or into  new media. . . .  Non-
human actors need no incentivization with the promise of exclusive rights under United States law, and copyright was therefore not designed to reach them. The understanding that ‘authorship’ is synonymous with human creation has 
persisted even as the copyright law has otherwise evolved .
123  
The case is currently under appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the D.C. Circuit. 
B.Authors, Writings, and Originality
Congress is empowered to regulate copyrights through the Copyright 
Clause of the Constitution.124 The clause enables Congress “[t]o promote 
the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to 
Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings 
and Discoveries.”125 Congress has done so by passing the Copyright Act, 
which protects “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible means

of expression.”126 Neither the Constitution nor the Copyright Act defines 
the terms “writings” or “authors.”127  
Statutory interpretation is a complex exercise, and there is 
considerable controversy about whether and to what extent courts should 
employ textualist versus purposive approaches.128 In general, however, 
interpretation is supposed to begin and end with the text if the text is plain 
and unambiguous.129 Given an undefined term, the U.S. Supreme Court 
generally applies a word’s “ordinary meaning.”130 There are many canons 
or techniques employed to determine ordinary meaning, including looking to common usage of a word, case law, parallel reasoning, etc.
131 
Courts also typically reference dictionary definitions, which vary. Here, 
Merriam- Webster defines an “author” as, “one that originates or creates 
something,”132 and “one” is defined as “a single person or thing.”133 
Literally, the Copyright Act is agnostic to the humanity of an author. If a text is ambiguous —for example, if it could be reasonably interpreted in 
more than one manner —courts more liberally attempt to determine 
legislative intent, which can include looking to legislative history and purpose.
134   
The Copyright Act also does not quantify the level of creativity 
required for originality, but numerous courts have considered the issue.135
In what has become the leading case on originality,  Feist Publications v. 
Rural Telephone Service ,136 the Supreme Court noted that originality is a 
“bedrock principle of copyright” and “the very premise of copyright

135.At various times, courts have waxed philosophical about originality being associated
with an author’s personality, genius, or creativity. For instance, in Bleistein v. Donaldson 
Lithographing Co. , the Supreme Court stated, “The copy is the personal reaction of an individual 
upon nature. Personality always contains something unique  . . . . something irreducible, which is 
one man’s alone. That something he may copyright[.]”  188 U.S. 239, 250 (1903);  cf. Alfred Bell 
& Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, Inc., 191 F.2d 99, 102 –03 (2d Cir. 1951) (stating that “[o]riginal” in 
copyright law means only that the particular work “owes its origin to the author” and that 
“[o]riginality in this context means little more than a prohibition of actual copying”) (internal quotations marks omitted).

law.”137 It held that information alone without some creativity cannot be 
protected by copyright,138 and that “some minimal degree of creativity” 
is required, although “the requisite level of creativity is extremely low” 
such that even a “slight amount” will suffice.139 “The vast majority of 
works make the grade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark, 
‘no matter how crude, humble or obvious’ it might be.”140 Creativity does 
not need to “be presented in an innovative or surprising way,” but it “cannot be so mechanical or routine as to require no creativity whatsoever.”
141 In Feist, organizing a telephone book alphabetically was 
found to be too mechanical to be protectable, even though the process 
was performed by a person.142  
As Part I has demonstrated, AI -generated works can meet the minimal 
creativity standards required for a work to qualify as original—at least if 
creativity is being considered objectively based on the work.143 Although 
no case explicitly holds that an AI -generated work is unprotectable, 
numerous judicial decisions have framed creativity and originality in human-centric terms.
144  
C.The Human Authorship Requirement
In 1973, the Copyright Office first published its policy of denying 
registrations for AI -generated works.145 The most recent iteration, 
published in 2021, states:  
The U.S. Copyright Office will register an original work of 
authorship, provided that the work was created by a human being. The copyright law only protects “the fruits of 
intellectual labor” that “are founded in the creative powers of the mind.” Trade-Mark Cases , 100 U.S. 82, 94 (1879). 
Because copyright law is limited to “original intellectual conceptions of the author,” the Office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the

work. Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony , 111 U.S. 
53, 58 (1884).146 
The citations referenced above come from two cases that took place 
in the late nineteenth century —somewhat before the existence of 
generative AI. In the In re Trade -Mark Cases ,147 interpreting the 
Copyright Clause to exclude the power to regulate trademarks, the Court 
stated, in dicta, that the term “writings” may be construed liberally but 
noted that writings that are “original, and are founded in the creative powers of the mind” a nd that are “the fruits of intellectual labor, 
embodied in the form of books, prints, engravings, and the like” may be protected.
148 
In Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony ,149 the accused infringer 
of a famous photograph of Oscar Wilde argued that a photograph did not qualify as a “writing” or as the work of an “author” because “the photograph is the mere mechanical reproduction of the physical features 
or outlines of some obje ct, animate or inanimate, and involves no 
originality of thought or any novelty in the intellectual operation 
connected with its visible reproduction in shape of a picture.”
150 The 
Court ruled for the photographer, noting that all forms of writing “by which the ideas in the mind of the author are given visible expression” were eligible for copyright protection as an original work of art.”
151 The 
Court declined to say that all photographs would meet the standard but in 
this instance held the photographer had shown “facts of originality, of 
intellectual production, of thought, and conception on the part of the 
author” to prove there was a copyr ightable work.152 Sarony is a 
significant case, among other reasons, because it deals with how the law 
should respond to technological evolution —there, photographs and 
whether a camera’s involvement negates human authorship.153 The 
Supreme Court ended up interpreting “writing” purposively and consistently with the goals of the Copyright Act, rather than applying a 
textual approach relying exclusively on a dictionary, literal meaning, or 
common usage of the word.

2023] DISRUPTING CREATIVITY  1163 
Although Thaler v. Perlmutter  was the first court decision specifically 
on AI-generated works,155 several cases have involved protection for 
“non-human” (and non -corporate) generated works —including those 
involving spiritual mediums. In Urantia v. Maaherra ,156 the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was confronted with the question of 
whether a book that both parties agreed was dictated by a spiritual being 
was copyrightable.157 Though the court stated human authorship is not 
expressly required by the copyright law,158 the court also stated that: 
it is not creations of divine beings that the copyright laws 
were intended to protect, and that in this case some element 
of human creativity must have occurred in order for the Book to be copyrightable. At the very least, for a worldly entity to be guilty of infringing a copyright, that entity must have 
copied something created by another worldly entity. . . . [N]otwithstanding the Urantia Book’s claimed 
non-human origin, the Papers in the form in which they were 
originally organized and compiled  . . . were at least partially 
the product of human creativity.
159 
In Penguin Books U.S.A., Inc. v.  New Christian Church of Full 
Endeavor , a district court was again confronted with whether a book, A 
Course in Miracles , purportedly dictated by Jesus, was copyrightable.160 
The court noted several times that most editing decisions were allegedly 
made in consultation  with Jesus, including the decision to register  a 
copyright in the book, but found grounds for attributing authorship to the 
humans involved in the “arrangement and selection of the materials.”161 
After finding for the plaintiffs, the court discussed another basis for 
copyright protection citing Urantia and the English case Cummins v. 
Bond,162 which also involved a spiritual dictation.163 The court stated that

expressly require ‘human’ authorship, and considerable controversy has arisen in recent years 
over the copyrightability of computer -generated works.”).

a human contribution should not be negated by any non -human 
involvement, much like a camera, noting that “[a]s a matter of law, 
dictation from a non-human source should not be a bar to copyright.”164 
Not all non -human authorship involves spiritual intervention. Naruto 
v. Slater165 concerned copyright protection of “monkey selfies,” a series
of photographs taken by Naruto, an Indonesian crested black macaque,
using a camera belonging to the nature photographer David Slater.166
Slater attempt ed to commercialize the photographs and claimed that he
was their author.167 He was then sued by People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals (PETA) on Naruto’s behalf, with PETA alleging that Naruto
was the author and that PETA would help administer the copyrights.168
The U.S. Court of Appea ls for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the case, but
based on standing rather than the Human Authorship Requirement.169 The
court held that “if an Act of Congress plainly states that animals have
statutory standing, then animals have statutory standing. If the statute
does not so plainly state, then animals do not have statutory standing. The
Copyright Act does not express ly authorize animals to file copyright
infringement suits under the statute.”170 The Ninth Circuit was apparently
unconcerned about a literal interpretation of the word “animals” barringhuman lawsuits.
The most recent USCO guidance released in March 2023 in the 
aftermath of the Recent Entrance to Paradise  and Zarya of the Dawn  
decisions states, “If a work ’s traditional elements of authorship were 
produced by a machine, the work lacks human authorship and the Office 
will not register it.”
171 It states with respect to the use of prompts: 
For example, when an AI technology receives solely a 
prompt from a human and produces complex written, visual, 
or musical works in response, the “traditional elements of 
authorship” are determined and executed by the 
technology—not the human user . . . . When an AI 
technology determines the expressive elements of its output, 
‘automatic writing’ from a 1900 -year-old spirit.” NIMMER, supra. The Chancery judge in 
Cummins  noted that he lacked jurisdiction in “the sphere in which [the dead spirit] moves” and 
declined to hold that “authorship and copyright rest with some one already domiciled on the other 
side of the inevitable river.” Id. (alteration in original).  
164.Penguin Books , 2000 WL 1028634, at *12. However, the court noted that in this case

the generated material is not the product of human 
authorship. As a result, that material is not protected by copyright and must be disclaimed in a registration application.
172  
The USCO has further clarified that the obligation to disclose AI -
generated elements rests on whether the material in the work generated 
by AI is appreciable or de minimis.173 The standard for ascertaining what 
is appreciable is: “Would that content be copyrightable if created by a 
human author?”174

works likely have been registered with the Copyright Office despite the

checked to see whether a work is AI -generated, nor have they required 
applicants to attest that a work is human -generated.176 Someone could file 
for an AI-generated work and simply list a person as an author —the AI 
is unlikely to complain. Someone could also file for an AI -generated 
work as a Work Made for Hire (WMFH) by virtue of employment (or 
otherwise), in which case there is no requirement to list any author.177 Or 
someone could register the work anonymously or pseudonymously.178 
The Copyright Office notes that applicants are not supposed to circumvent the Human Authorship Requirement, and, assuming an 
applicant knows about the requirement, that the office considers 
deliberately registering an AI -generated work without disclosing the role 
of AI to be fraud.
179  
Registration is not a requirement for the existence of copyright.180 
Copyright exists automatically in an original work once fixed, but 
registration is (usually) necessary to enforce copyright through 
litigation.181 Registration also allows copyright owners to seek enhanced 
damages and attorney’s fees in litigation, and it provides a variety of 
additional benefits.182 With or without registration, the mere threat of 
copyright infringement litigation can be enough to drive settlements from alleged infringers. 
If an applicant registered an AI -generated work with the Copyright 
Office without disclosing how the work was made, and if the work was enforced in litigation, its origins might come to light in the discovery 
process. If courts then applied a Human Authorship Requirement that 
would be a defense to infringement, because it would render the

plaintiff’s claim to copyright ownership invalid —so there could be no 
infringement.183 On the other hand, even if a court was inclined to apply 
such a requirement, not all lawsuits involve discovery, and defense 
attorneys may not thoroughly investigate how a work was made. Plus, 
even attorneys aware of the Human Authorship Requirement and suspicious of a work’s origin may be frustrated by discovery failures or 
bad behavior.  
Many AI art generators available online have terms and conditions 
that state either that the AI provider owns any copyright in AI output, that 
the provider transfers its rights to the user, or that the provider will license 
the images or music to the user.
184 For example, Night Café, a website 
that hosts several text -to-image generation models, until mid -2022 stated 
in its terms of service that “all intellectual property rights in that specific 
Artwork is transferred” to the consumer.185 The website currently states 
that it cannot guarantee that users will be able to claim copyright in the 
images created due to “the evolving and developing nature of the law around AI created works.”
 186 AIVA, the AI composer service, still states 
as of mid -2023 that the company owns all rights but will license or sell 
them for a fee.187 For the release of large models in an open source 
fashion, many companies and groups, including Stability AI, have adopted licenses such as the Responsible AI Licenses (RAIL), allowing 
for permissive use of the models but “restricting AI and ML software 
from being used in a specific list of harmful applications, e.g. in 
surveillance and crime prediction, while allowing all other 
applications.”

confronting the Copyright Office.189 The office had already received 
applications for AI -assisted or AI -generated works including an abstract 
drawing, a musical composition, and compilations.190 Though he 
announced no policy for dealing with such applications, he suggested the 
relevant issue should be whether an AI was merely an assisting instrument, as with a camera, or whether an AI was responsible for 
conceiving and executing the elements required for authorship.
191  
In 1974, Congress created the Commission on New Technological 
Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) to study issues related to copyright and computers, including AI -generated works.
192 CONTU 
wrote in 1979 that there was no need for special treatment of AI -
generated works because they did not exist and were not immediately foreseeable.
193 According to CONTU, the AI of the time was not 
autonomously generating creative results, it was simply assisting human 
authors.194 CONTU did, however, unanimously conclude that “[w]orks 
created by the use of computers should be afforded copyright protection if they are original works of authorship within the Act of 1976.”
195 The 
CONTU report stated, “The eligibility of any work for protection depends 
not upon the device or devices used in its creation, but rather upon the 
presence of at least minimal human creative effort at the time the work is produced.”
196 The Commission found that the author of an AI -assisted 
work is the person “who employs the computer.”197   
In 1986, nearly a decade later, technological advances prompted 
Congress’s Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to issue a report 
emphasizing that the increasing sophistication of AI posed more 
challenges than CONTU acknowledged.198 OTA was critical of 
CONTU’s conclusion that AIs were merely “inert tools of creation” and 
indicated in many cases they were at least “co -creators.”199 The OTA

report did not state that AI -generated works were ineligible for copyright 
protection, but it did predict problems with determining authorship.200  
In 1993, Arthur Miller, one of CONTU’s commissioners, expressed 
confidence that  “if the day arrives when a computer really is the sole 
author of an original artistic, musical, or literary work (whether novel or 
computer program), copyright law will be embracive and malleable 
enough to assimilate that development into the world of prot ected 
works.”201 He explained that “CONTU did not attempt to determine 
whether a computer work generated with little or no human involvement is copyrightable”  because it was “too speculative to consider at the 
time.”
202 
In 2019, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) sought 
public comment on whether a “work produced by an AI algorithm or 
process, without the involvement of a natural person  . . . qualif[ies] as a 
work of authorship protectable under U.S. copyright law.”203 A 
subsequent report concluded that most commenters agreed there was no need to modify current IP laws.
204 However, the report relied on a series 
of questionable assumptions about AI.205 For example, the conclusion

permitted under  the Copyright Act, he states : 
It is far from clear that the federal courts ultimately will conclude that our 
copyright law requires human authorship, although that conclusion may have an 
emotional appeal to many. The Constitution’s reference to “authors” does not 
prevent the protection of computer -created works because that reference does not 
mandate that authors be flesh and blood. Textually, the Clause says little more than that ‘Authors’ are those responsible for creating the “Writings” that 
Congress chooses to protect. Two centuries ago, that meant only maps, charts, 
and books, all of which at that time had only human authors. Today, of course, 
“Writings” embraces an amazing spectrum of modes of expression completely 
unknown at that time, including computer programs, computer databases, sound 
recordings, motion pictures, photographs, and countless others. There is no 
reason why “Authors” cannot undergo a comparable transformation. Certainly, 
the policies underlying copyright do not prevent it; if anything, these policies 
might well be inhibited by a human author requirement.

F.Academic Viewpoints
There is a rich body of literature on AI and IP, AI -assisted and AI-
generated works, and AI authorship.213 Opinions vary widely, but most 
commentators believe that AI -generated works should not be protected 
because copyright law is designed to encourage human creativity or 
because the market failures that copyright law is designed to solve do not 
exist the same way in the context of AI- generated works.  
For example, Professor Daniel Gervais argues that, while AI -
generated works can resemble human -generated works, AI -generated 
works should not receive protection because there is no human author.214 
He gives several reasons for this conclusion, such as because AI needs no 
incentive to create.215 Further, “copyright is meant to promote human 
creativity,” and creating incentives to have more productions in the 
literary and artistic field made by machines could in fact pose a threat to 
(human) progress.”216 In his view, just because modern authorship is 
more “collective and collaborative,” it does not follow that machines 
should come “under the same normative umbrella.”217 In addition, he 
argues that if AI cannot accept liability for its creations, it would be 
unreasonable to make it an author —“no rights without 
responsibilities.”218 
213.See, e.g., Pamela Samuelson, Allocating Ownership Rights in Computer -Generated
Works, 47 U. PITT. L. REV. 1185, 1192, 1199 –1200 (1986) (arguing for protection of AI -generated 
works, but that AI cannot be an author because AI does not need incentives to generate output:

1172 FLORIDA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 75 
Professors Carys Craig and Ian Kerr argue that AI authorship is 
“oxymoronic.219 They believe that “the threshold for attributing 
authorship does not depend on the evolution or state of the art in AI or 
robotics.”220 Instead, “the very notion of ‘AI authorship’ rests on a 
category mistake: it is not an error about the current or potential 
capacities, capabilities, intelligence, or sophistication of machines; 
rather, it is an error about the ontology of authorship.”221 Believing that 
“human communication is the very point of authorship as a social 
practice,” they argue that authorship is “properly the preserve of the 
human.”222 They suggest authorship is relational and that “it necessitates 
a vision of authorship as a dialogic and communicative act that is 
inherently social, with the cultivation of selfhood and social relations as 
the entire point of the practice.”223 They are also concerned about the 
romanticization of AI and worry that AI authorship could harm human 
authors and society.224 They argue that, even if the connection between 
human and AI is obscured to the point where it becomes impossible to trace creative elements to the mind of a human author, “[i]t simply does not follow that AIs either could or should therefore be understood as 
potentially stepping into the category of ‘authors.’”
225 
Along the lines of the USPTO report discussed above, Professor 
James Grimmelmann argues that AI -generated works do not currently 
exist and claims that they will not until AI achieves something like 
general artificial intelligence.226 He states, “The scholarship pondering 
the possibility of computer -authored works is surprisingly extensive, 
even though no one has ever exhibited even one work that could plausibly claim to have a computer for an ‘author’ in the sense that the Copyright Act uses the term.”
227 This is so , even if it is difficult to identify a human 
that look like copyrightable subject matter, at least not until and unless the machine, as purported 
‘author’ (as a matter of copyright law), can accept full responsibility for ‘its’ creation. Furthermore, this conclusion can be anchored in the well -established correlativity thesis (‘no 
rights without responsibilities’) essential to rights theory.  . . . This is a central normative point, 
anchored in copyright history: No copyright should be granted to an author who is not also responsible for the work’s mea ning and content, whether it be libel or copyright infringement.”).

author, which, he notes, is not unusual in authorship disputes among 
people.228  
Professor Jane Ginsburg and Luke Budiardjo argue that even the most 
advanced AIs are mere agents of human programmers or users.229 They 
suggest that asking whether AI can be an author is the wrong question.230 
The right question is how to evaluate the claims of human authorship —
acknowledging that, in some situations, authorship claims will be too 
attenuated and works authorless.231 They write, 
Even the most sophisticated generative machines proceed 
through processes designed entirely by humans who 
program them, and are therefore closer to amanuenses than 
to true “authors”. Therefore, even if the concept of “author” 
in the United States Constitution and the Copyright Act 
could encompass non -human actors, the machines of today 
would not qualify as “authors.”232  
Because they see machines as mere agents,233 they claim that 
“[a]rtificially intelligent machines . . . do not usurp human authorship as 
long as humans sufficiently ‘control’ them. Since we have posited that 
computers cannot run off on a ‘frolic of their own,’ some humans will 
wield the requisite co ntrol . . . .”234 They conclude, “Vesting authorship 
in the task assigner would sidestep the requirement that authors contribute 
‘expression,’ and not merely ‘ideas’ . . . .”235 
Professor Annemarie Bridy calls AI authorship “a bad penny of a 
question.”236 She argues the better focus is on copyright ownership and 
concludes AI -generated works should be copyrightable but that this 
would require modifying the work for hire doctrine:237   
AI authorship is readily assimilable to the current copyright 
framework through the work made for hire doctrine, which is a mechanism for vesting copyright directly in a legal 
us willing to regard them as copyright owners. But if that day ever comes, it will because we have 
already made a decision in other areas of life and law to treat them as persons, and copyright law will fall in line. But unless those mechanical minds also invent workable time travel, their future 
existence is of no bearing now. The copyright issues we would face on that far off day are 
fundamentally different in kind from those we face today.”).

person who is acknowledged not to be the author -in-fact of 
the work in question. Through this legal fiction, the machinic 
creativity of generative code can be recognized for what it really is—something other than (but owing to) the human 
creativity of its coder.
238 
Finally, Professor Robert Denicola argues that AI -generated works 
should be protected , and that the AI user should be the author.239 Failing 
to protect such works “denies the incentive of copyright to an 
increasingly large group of works that are indistinguishable in substance 
and public value from works created by human beings.”240 With respect 
to authorship, he argues: 
[T]he copyright statute does not define “author” and the
constitutional interpretation of that concept is sufficientlybroad to include a human being who originates the creationof a work. A computer user who initiates the creation ofcomputer- generated ex pression should be recognized as the
author and copyright owner of the resulting work.

Many jurisdictions lack clear rules, and some jurisdictions are actively 
reconsidering their current frameworks.243  
For example, as mentioned earlier, the United Kingdom became the 
first jurisdiction to explicitly protect AI -generated works in 1988.244 
Some current or former commonwealth jurisdictions, such as Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and India, subsequently passed similar 
legislation to protect AI -generated works.
245 The United Kingdom 
Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) conducted two consultations on IP 
and AI between 2020 and 2022 and ultimately concluded that there 
should be no change to the existing scheme for the protection of AI -
generated works.246 
There is no equivalent to the United Kingdom’s system for protecting 
AI-generated works in European Union (EU) jurisdictions, and the EU 
has yet to formally address protections for AI -generated works.247 To 
obtain copyright protection in the EU, works must be original in the sense 
of being the “author’s own intellectual creation.”248 The Court of Justice 
of the European Union (CJEU) has held that only works involving “free 
and creative choices” and stamped with an author’s “personal touch” 
qualify.249 Most scholars argue that, although AI -generated works cannot

be protected by copyright in the EU, they might qualify for “neighboring 
rights” (copyright -like rights) or be protected under unfair competition 
laws.250 Recently in France, a proposal was put forth to Parliament stating 
that when it comes to AI -generated works, “the only rights holders are 
the authors or rights holders of the works who made it possible to design said artificial work.”
251  
There is an important international component to the protection of AI -
generated works given the nature of the global economy. Most IP rights are national rights.
252 If a person writes a book in the United States, they 
want that book to be protected in France. This is a particular challenge 
given the intangible nature of IP. Something like the content of a book is 
relatively easy to copy compared to a physical object like a designer bag. 
In part to address this problem, a series of international agreements requires nearly all nations to provide minimum levels of copyright protection as well as to provide foreign nationals with the same copyright protections 
afforded to  domestic citizens.
253  
International agreements governing copyright law do not explicitly 
authorize—or prohibit —protections for AI -generated works.254 But if a 
jurisdiction such as the United States provides protection for AI -
generated works, it will be required to protect AI -generated works 
regardless of where they are made, even if they are made in a jurisdiction, such as France, that does not protect  AI-generated works.
255 That allows 
for a situation in which consumers in France, but not consumers in the 
United States, can freely use and copy AI -generated works made 
anywhere. On the one hand, this is unfair because it allows some

jurisdictions to “free-ride” on work being done in other jurisdictions. On 
the other hand, not all countries are likely to be net exporters of AI -
generated works, so net IP importers may end up better off without 
providing protections.  
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the United 
Nations agency most responsible for IP matters, has become a significant forum for debates over AI and IP.
256 At the moment, WIPO is focusing 
on promoting stakeholder dialogue, but at some point, an international 
treaty on AI -generated works might emerge from these discussions.257 
More than thirty years ago, WIPO considered including protections for 
AI-generated works in model laws, but ultimately concluded further 
study was needed.258  
Recently, as policymakers have become acutely aware of the 
disruptive nature of AI, jurisdictions have been engaged in a sort of AI 
regulatory arms race. For instance, the European Union is working to 
create a new legal framework specifically targeted to AI: the EU AI 
Act.259 Though the proposed Act does not specifically address the issue 
of AI-generated output, proposed transparency rules require the 
disclosure of AI -generated content and the publication of summaries of 
copyrighted data used for training.260 
III.PROTECTING AI-GENERATED WORKS AND ACCEPTING AI
AUTHORSHIP  
A.Should AI-Generated Works Be Protectable?
Whether copyright protection should be available for AI -generated 
works depends on the costs and benefits of providing protection, 
including the possible problems with lack of protection and the 
alternatives to protection. With human -generated works, there are 
numerous benefits associated with copyright protection. As discussed

earlier, these break down broadly into (1) economic incentives, namely 
encouraging the production and dissemination of works, and (2) 
protection of author moral rights.261  
There are also numerous costs associated with copyright protection.262 
Copyright allows right holders to prevent others from making or using protected works.
263 It can thus be used to prevent the production and 
distribution of works because right holders can elect not to make, sell, or 
license their works while also preventing others from doing so.264 Where 
right holders elect to commercialize works, copyright allows them to 
limit competition and charge more for their works than they could 
otherwise.265 Right holders can also prevent third parties from making 
infringing266 and derivative works (such as fan fiction).267 Intellectual 
property rights can thus impede the sharing and further development of

in which there is a pasture where cattle are free for herdsmen to keep). Whether the costs of IP 
rights outweigh the benefits is the subject of extensive literature which suggests it is nuanced and 
context dependent. See, e.g., ELINOR OSTROM, GOVERNING THE COMMONS: THE EVOLUTION OF
INSTITUTIONS FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION 14 (James E. Alt & Douglass C. North eds., 1990) (arguing 
that there is not one solution to a problem, but that “‘getting the institutions right’ is a difficult, 
time-consuming, conflict -invoking process . . . that requires reliable information about time and 
place variables as well as a broad repertoire of culturally acceptable rules”).

(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; (2) to prepare
derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; (3) to distribute copies or
phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of
ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending; (4) in the case of literary, musical,dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other

knowledge, and there are benefits to having intellectual property in the 
public domain—meaning not protected by intellectual property laws.268 
Even for human -generated works, stakeholders disagree on the 
appropriate level of protection.269 But the general view of Congress and 
the courts has been that the benefits of copyright  outweigh the costs.270 
“The granting of such exclusive rights, under the proper terms and 
conditions, confers a benefit upon the public that outweighs the evils of 
the temporary monopoly.”271   
B.A Brief History of American Copyright Law
The first modern copyright law was the Statute of Anne,272 passed in 
1710 in then- Great Britain.273 Prior to this, exclusive rights to works were 
given by statute to publishers and printers rather than authors.274 
Although, some early cases involving analogues to modern copyright infringement were brought under common law causes of action.

275.The first and most famous “copyright” case may have occurred more than a thousand
years before the passage of the Statute of Anne. King Diarmed of Ireland (allegedly) adjudicated 
a dispute between St. Columba and Abbot Fennian involving claims that St. C olumba had illegally 
copied Fennian’s psalter. King Diarmed ruled in favor of Fennian, pronouncing that “[t]o every 
cow belongs her calf, therefore to every book belongs its copy.” The Cathach / The Psalter of St 
Columba, ROYAL IR. ACAD. (Apr. 15, 2021 ), www.ria.ie/cathach -psalter-st -columba

general law of copyright, “Roman law precepts can clearly be seen in numerous aspects of 
copyright doctrine: the essence of copyright as intangible property; the nature of the public 
domain; different types of copyrightable works (works of authorship) and the sale of them;

1180 FLORIDA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 75 
The introduction of the printing press was a major technological 
development and one that inexorably altered the landscape for intellectual 
property.276 Prior to this, copying a book was an expensive, error -prone, 
and laborious undertaking.277 With the printing press, publishers could 
produce books cost -effectively in large quantities, which had profound 
implications for publishers, authors, and governments concerned about 
the spread of certain information.278 Shortly after its introduction, English 
authorities established an ostensible monopoly on printing with the 
Stationers’ Company.279 In return for the grant of certain exclusive rights, 
the Stationers’ Company controlled the publication of treasonable, 
seditious, heretical, or blasphemous books.280 Unless a printer or 
publisher had a special relationship with the government, it was expected 
to register any publication with the Stationers’ Company.281 By 
registering a work, the printer or publisher directly received a monopoly 
on its publication.282  
Eventually, the Statute of Anne introduced the principle of rights in a 
work belonging directly to an author.283 While the Statute broke up the 
Stationers’ Company monopoly and introduced new author rights 
(authors being more sympathetic right holders than publishing 
companies), in practice authors had to assign their works to publishers both to have their works disseminated and to make money.

was to ensure the production of books and codify the continuation of 
existing commercial practices.285 
In the American Colonies, the Statute of Anne did not apply and there 
was no general copyright system.286 The only legal protections for works 
were ad hoc privileges issued by local legislatures giving printers or publishers exclusive rights over specific texts, usually those deemed to 
be of particular interest to the public, such as a collection of colony 
laws.
287 In 1787, James Madison submitted a provision to the Framers of 
the U.S. Constitution to “secure to literary authors their copyrights for a 
limited time.”288 This was the precursor of the Constitution’s Copyright 
Clause, which ultimately granted Congress the power to “promote the 
Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for a limited Time to 
Authors and Inventors the exclusive right to their respective  Writings and 
Discoveries.”289 The language of the Constitution is noticeably more 
focused on public interest than Madison’s proposal.  
In 1790, Congress passed its first Copyright Act, which inherited 
numerous provisions from the Statute of Anne.290 The Act stated it was 
“for the encouragement of learning, by securing copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times

PATTERSON , COPYRIGHT IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE  14 (Vanderbilt Univ., 1968) (arguing the 
Statute of Anne was a trade -regulation statute aimed to promote competition). In contrast to the 
common law tradition, Copyright law developed in France in the shadow of the French Revolution 
and subsequent political philosophies to, at least ostensibly, glorify individual authors. See Jane 
C.Ginsburg, A Tale of Two Copyrights: Literary Property in Revolutionary France and America ,
64 TUL. L. REV. 991, 992 (1989). An “exclusive right is conferred on authors because their
property is the most justified since it flows from their intellectual creation.” Id. Emphasis on moral
rights became pervasive, including the rights of heirs to claim remedies if subsequent owners alter
or distort works in ways that harm the reputation of the original author. See William Strauss,  The
Moral Right of the Author , 4 AM. J. COMP. L. 506 (1955). Even here, however, Professor Jane
Ginsburg cautions that the framers of French copyright laws may not have greeted the concept of
author’s rights with as much enthusiasm as later writers. See Ginsburg, supra, at 1012. She notes
that “the most vociferous advocates for authors’ rights were not authors, but their publishers, or,
more specifically, the Paris Community of Book Sellers and Printers” and that “a strong currentof Enlightenment thought objected on instrumentalist grounds to any assertion of property rights
in idea-bearing works: individual proprietary claims would retard the progress of knowledge.” Id.

therein mentioned.”291 The Act mentioned authors and proprietors, but 
the public remained the law’s primary beneficiaries.292 Policymakers 
hoped that copyright protection would facilitate commercial activities, 
lead to a more informed and engaged citizenry, and promote democracy 
by encouraging free speech.293  
As American copyright law continued to develop, Congress continued 
to emphasize its public -centric focus. In submitting the bill that became 
the Copyright Act of 1909,294 the House of Representatives committee 
responsible for the bill submitted a report, also adopted by the Senate, 
noting the following: 
The enactment of copyright legislation by Congress under 
the terms of the Constitution is not based upon any natural right that the author has in his writings, for the Supreme Court has held that such rights as he has are purely statutory rights, but upon the ground that the welfare of the public will 
be served and progress of science and useful arts will be promoted by securing to authors for limited periods the exclusive rights to their writings. The Constitution does not establish copyrights, but provide s that Congress shall have 
the power to grant such rights if it thinks best. Not primarily for the benefit of the author, but primarily for the benefit of the public, such rights are given. Not that any particular class of citizens, however worthy, may ben efit, but because the 
policy is believed to be for the benefit of the great body of people, in that it will stimulate writing and invention, to give some bonus to authors and inventors.

Since then, the Supreme Court has explicitly endorsed the supremacy 
of the public interest as the motivating force behind copyright law.296 For

300  
C.Protecting AI-Generated Works and Objections
The history and purpose of the Constitution and the Copyright Act 
both weigh in favor protecti ng AI-generated works because the public 
interest trumps any direct benefit to authors. With AI -generated works, 
allowing protection will encourage people to develop and use creative AI to generate and disseminate socially valuable works, thereby achieving 
the goal of copyright law.
301 Absent protection, certain AI -generated 
works will never be created or disseminated. That is because, just like 
human-generated works, the creation and dissemination of works, or at 
least certain works, require significant investments of time and money.302 
Failing to provide protection also requires producers and distributors 
of works—at least those for whom copyright is a meaningful incentive 
such as movie and music studios—to use human authors even if they are 
less efficient. For instance, even if an AI can generate an illustration for 
a movie poster at a fraction of the time and expense of a human artist, and 
even if consumer focus groups prefer the AI -generated poster, a movie 
studio will need to employ a human artist to obtain copyright. That is a 
socially wasteful outcome if an AI can complete a task better, faster, and 
cheaper than a person. The same argument applies to having two tiers of 
protection for AI -generated and human -generated works. If the additional 
benefits associated with human authorship are indeed a meaningful 
incentive, it will push producers to employ people even when it is not otherwise efficient. If those benefits are not meaningful, then they are not rights that should be provided for either AI -generated or human -
generated works.

301.By contrast, failing to protect these works will encourage people to misrepresent the
role of AI in the creative process and to misrepresent authorship. See Harsha Gangadharbatla, The 
Role of AI Attribution Knowledge in the Evaluation of Artwork , 40 EMPIRICAL STUDS. OF THE ARTS 
125, 137 (2022) (finding that individuals were more likely to purchase AI art when it was 
misrepresented to them that the art was created by a human).  
302.See Breyer, supra note 274, at 292. Even in the case of human -generated works
investment often comes from a publisher or producer rather than an author. Id.

1184 FLORIDA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 75 
Nevertheless, some critics believe that AI -generated works should not 
be protected, either because copyright law is intended only to promote 
human creativity or because the involvement of AI alters the cost/benefit 
analysis. Of course, it would be useful to have high -quality empirical 
evidence of the impact of copyright on the producers and distributors of 
AI-generated works. However, to our knowledge, that evidence does not 
exist, nor does it drive policymaking with respect to human -generated 
works.303 
1. Human Exceptionalism
The argument in favor of human exceptionalism comes in several 
forms. The first version is that human creativity is functionally 
exceptional—in other words, that an AI cannot autonomously generate 
an original work. This argument was made long ago by René D escartes, 
who argued that a machine could never use words in the way we “declare 
our thoughts to others.”304 Even if it could give some poor imitation of 
speech, it could not give an “approximately meaningful answer to what 
is said in its presence, as the dullest of men can do.”305 Descartes’s 
predictions had proven inaccurate by the 1970s, but the same basic argument drove CONTU’s conclusion that AI was not autonomously generating creative output.
306 As Part II of this Article has demonstrated, 
whether accurate in CONTU’s time, technology has reached the stage 
where an argument for functional exceptionalism can no longer be 
supported—at least not in terms of meeting the very low bar of originality 
for copyright purposes. The basic argument continues to be made, the 
goal post having shifted, that while AI can make mediocre art, it cannot 
make great art.307 But regardless of its veracity, it is not relevant for 
copyright law, which does not concern itself with greatness.308

analysis in association with the forthcoming Copyright Act of 1976 and indicating that the

307.This argument involves the “AI effect,” namely that once AI can do something, it is
discounted. As AI historian Pamela McCorduck  wrote, “it’s part of the history of the field of 
artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a com puter do 
something— play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems —there was a 
chorus of critics to say, but that’s not thinking.” PAMELA MCCORDUCK, MACHINES WHO THINK

2023] DISRUPTING CREATIVITY  1185 
The second version of the argument is that human creativity is 
ontologically exceptional, namely that even if an AI and a person can 
generate the same work, the way a person does so is fundamentally 
different from the way an AI does so.309 There are at least three problems 
with this argument. First, there is no scientific, or even philosophical, 
consensus on the nature of creativity.310 Without a clear understanding of 
creativity and thus what the difference is between what an AI and a human being are doing, it seems problematic to argue that only what people are doing counts as creative —and even more problematic to base 
laws on that ass umption.
311 Second, to the extent creativity is understood, 
there is no consensus that AI cannot exhibit creativity.312 There is an 
extensive body of literature on philosophy of mind and computer science 
that explores the nature of creativity, and at least some seminal thinkers 
have argued that it is a purely mechanical process analogous to how some AIs operate.
313 For instance, Marvin Minsky, the “Father of Artificial 
picture is none the less a picture and none the less a subject of copyright, that it is used for an 
advertisement” than etchings of a great work of art). 
309.Although no longer framed in theological terms, the belief in human exceptionalism
divorced from the reality of functional equivalence does at times veer close to the “Theological 
Objection” to machine thinking addressed by Alan Turing, namely that “[t]hinking is a function 
of man’s immortal soul. God has given an immortal soul to every man and woman, but not to any 
other animal or to machines. Hence no animal or machine can think.” Alan M. Turing, Computing 
Machinery and Intelligence , 59 MIND 433, 443 (1950).

ANIMAL L. 15, 23 (2008) (“[N]o express requirement prevents either a computer’s or an animal’s

Intelligence,”314 had a theory to explain creativity called “Society of 
Minds.”315 He argued that minds are not a single unified intelligence but 
rather a collection of smaller minds that come together and help to solve 
problems like a complex mix of competing generative algorithms.316 The 
claim, then, that what an AI and a person do to generate something 
creative is fundamentally different does not reflect a scientific consensus. 
The third, and best, reason why the ontological exceptionalism 
argument fails is that the way a work is made should be irrelevant to its protection. Alan Turing, another pioneering computer scientist, 
considered a broader version of this question in his se minal work, 
Computing Machinery and Intelligence .
317 He began by asking whether 
machines could think, then attempted to define “machine” and “think.”318 
Ultimately, given the lack of objective understanding of the nature of 
thought, he reframed the question to ask whether a machine could behave indistinguishably from a person.
319 Turing believed that the nature of 
thought, while of interest to philosophers, is not practically relevant —it 
is behavior that matters.320 To Turing (and Minsky), thinking was an

Too, 39 COLUM. J.L. & ARTS 403, 408 (2016) (“The use of rules at all is simply the choice to split 
the creative process into two stages rather than one. The inputs —whatever it is that we mean by 
‘creativity’ or ‘expression’ or ‘authorship’ —are indistinguishable, and so is the outpu t—a fixed 
copy of the work.”). “If an author, for her own convenience, decides to automate some of the steps by programming a computer, copyright should not look any less generously upon her.  . . . To say 
that an author creates intuitively is simply to say  that neither she nor we have ready access to the

impressive but mechanistic phenomenon, one that eventually would be 
replicated by a machine.321 Even if some critics are right that Turing took 
this concept too far and that an AI itself is not metaphysically creative,322 
Turing’s analysis at least counters the ontological argument in the copyright context because copyright law is utilitarian and should not be concerned with philosophical distinctions that interfere with positive 
consequentialist outcomes. 
The last version of the human exceptionalism argument is that 
regardless of functional and ontological similarity, there are consequentialist justifications for only encouraging human activity.
323 
This is the argument made by Professors Craig and Kerr when they claim 
that authorship is inherently a relational activity and that copyright is not 
about simply generating works but rather about promoting human 
communication and socialization.324 But while Professors Kerr and Craig 
are no doubt correct that some works have relational benefits, their 
normative goals are not those of the Constitution or Congress.325 
2. Overprotection
Separate from the exceptionalism arguments, protection could be 
objected to on the basis that the costs and benefits of copyright protection 
differ between AI - and human -generated works. The benefits of 
protection may be reduced because no incentive, or at  least less incentive, 
is needed for existing AI to create new works. Once a creative AI like DALL·E 2 exists, the marginal cost of having it create additional works 
may be close to zero. This is to say that the investment in the case of AI-
generated works  comes mainly upfront in the development, training, 
improvement, and iteration of models. Once an AI is fully operational, it 
algorithm she follows.” Id.; see also Alan L. Durham, The Random Muse: Authorship and 
Indeterminacy , 44 WM. & MARY L. REV. 569, 574 (2002) (arguing that authorship should extend 
to some indeterminate works).

can simply continue to make a practically limitless number of works, 
albeit with some ongoing costs of maintenance and operation. As a result, the scale tips against protection because many or most AI -generated 
works would be created in the absence of copyright protection. This line of reasoning might alternately suggest that a more limited copyright scope, such as a shorter term of protection, would be appropriate for AI -
generated works.  
While less incentive may be needed after an AI has been fully 
programmed or trained, this ignores some key considerations. First, the 
initial development of creative AI such as DALL·E 2 tends to require 
substantial investment.326 The incentive may simply be needed further 
upstream in the process than is generally the case with human creativity. Substantial investment may also be needed to continue improving an AI 
to generate better output.
327 Also, even if less investment is needed to 
create a work, the same level of investment is still required to disseminate 
a work regardless of how it is created.  
The costs could also be greater in the case of AI -generated works due 
to negative impacts on (1) employment and (2) property distribution. The 
technological unemployment concern arises from the idea that if  AI can 
produce certain types of work faster and cheaper than human creatives, 
the demand for human labor in those areas  will decrease.328 It is 
essentially a more specific version of the automation scare—the concern 
that automation will result in wide-spread unemployment.329  
These concerns about automation date back to at least the first 
industrial revolution,330 but automation historically has not increased

overall unemployment even as it has reduced the need for certain types 
of labor.331 For example, at the beginning of the twentieth century, about 
41% of the workforce was in agriculture, while in the early twenty -first 
century, only about 2% works in that sector.332 This is not a 3 9% increase 
in the unemployment rate.333 Rather, technology has made agricultural 
labor vastly more efficient, and people have transitioned to different jobs 
that have resulted in greater overall productivity.334 In the present context, 
it may similarly be the case that some creative tasks are rendered obsolete 
but that human creatives will transition to different tasks or types of 
creative work.  
Of course, gains to gross domestic product are likely scant consolation 
to individual creatives now facing competition from AI and potentially losing their jobs, and society has not traditionally done well at lessening 
the burden on people rendered technologically unemployed.
335 But the 
solution to technological unemployment is to provide enhanced social 
benefits and retraining so that the costs of automation are fairly 
distributed along with the benefits, not to prevent or discourage businesses from automating.
336 The latter is socially wasteful, like a law 
that mandates human elevator attendants in lieu of automatic control panels.

1190 FLORIDA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 75 
The distributional concern is that large corporations may be more 
likely than small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to have the resources 
necessary to develop and use generative AI effectively,338 resulting in a 
consolidation of copyright in the hands of companies like Disney and Meta. In turn, this could be a problem if it exacerbates financial inequality or if it is the result of, or results in, unfair business practices or anti -
competitive behavior.  
As a preliminary matter, it is far from certain that generative AI will 
preferentially benefit large enterprises. It might also be the case that 
generative AI democratizes copyright ownership. Today’s generative AI 
allows individuals to produce creative works in ways that were previously 
impractical.
339 But even assuming the financial benefits of generative AI 
preferentially flow to large enterprises, that is not a reason to prohibit copyright in AI -generated works. Large enterprises already hold a 
disproportionate share of financial resources and intellectual property,
340 
and we do not punish entities simply for being large or for dominating markets due to “superior products, business acumen, or historic[al] accident.”
341 
If the concern is distributional fairness, namely that it would be a bad 
social outcome for AI to generate a large amount of wealth that flows disproportionately to the already wealthy (perhaps even at the expense of 
those with lower socioeconomic status), the solution is a  more 
progressive tax system rather than the impediment of technological 
progress.
342  
If the concern is unfair or anti -competitive business practices, there 
are solutions to this as well. For instance, Disney could, hypothetically, 
have very powerful AI systems generate countless variations o f Marvel 
comics, characters, movies, etc. Because copyright exists from the moment of fixation and does not require registration, it could protect a large amount of creative content in this manner. This sort of activity could 
be used productively to make better Marvel content, say by generating a 
billion versions of a comic book and having an AI model which version 
is most likely to be appreciated by consumers.

However, in the hands of a “copyright troll” instead of Disney, this 
sort of activity might also be used to make money through strategic 
litigation, without much investment in distributing works. This could be 
done by publishing all billion versions of the  comic book online, having 
AI search the Internet for works with some similarities to these versions, 
and suing in an unduly aggressive or opportunistic manner to attempt to 
exclude other content generators from the genre or just to extract rent.343  
There are solutions to this problem built into copyright law already, 
which seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between exclusive control and public access through mechanisms such as the fair use 
doctrine, which permits the unlicensed use of protected  works in certain 
circumstances.
344 Perhaps most importantly, AI -generated works may 
profoundly change the infringement analysis, including in ways that may 
solve the troll problem.  
3. AI-Generated Infringement
Copyright allows a right holder to prevent third parties from, among 
other things, reproducing a copyrighted work without permission.345 This 
requires a right holder to prove both that an infringer copied a protected work and that there is substantial similarity between the protected and infringing work.
346 Therefore, if a work is not actually copied from 
another work, regardless of how similar the works are, there is no 
infringement.347 In other words, “independent creation” is a defense to 
infringement.348 
As a practical matter, it is often difficult to directly prove copying 
occurred because whether the infringer copied may be a fact known only 
to the infringer—and human infringers have reasons to be less than fully 
forthcoming. As a result, a right holder is allowed to indirectly prove copying by showing similarities between works that are unlikely to exist if they had been independently made.
349 An alleged infringer can then 
rebut this inference of copying by presenting evidence of independent 
343.Such practices are associated with the pejorative term “copyright troll.” See Matthew

creation, for instance, that an alleged infringer could not possibly have 
had access to a protected work.350  
To take an extreme hypothetical, if an author wrote an exact copy of 
another author’s bestselling novel , but claimed she did so without ever 
having seen the bestseller, that could be a defense to infringement. However, the likelihood of two authors separately writing the exact same 
book is effectively zero. The math involved is reminiscent of the infinite 
monkey theorem, which predicts that a room full of monkeys with 
typewriters will eventually reproduce by random chance all the books in 
the British Museum .
351 While theoretically possible, if the monkeys need 
to type the word “banana” on typewriters with fifty keys, if they press 
keys at random and each key has an equal chance of being pressed, the 
chance that the first six letters pressed spell banana is (1/50 )6—one in 
fifteen billion six hundred twenty -five million. But more practically, the 
infinite monkey theorem effectively describes a brute force computational problem -solving method called the British Museum 
algorithm.
352 This algorithm finds a solution by checking all possibilities 
one by one.353 This has allowed AI to, among other things, completely 
solve the game of checkers —a game with “roughly 500 billion possible 
positions (5 x 1020).”354 
AI-generated works may alter the infringement analysis with respect 
to proving copying and independent creation. Proving copying may no 
longer be an issue if an AI’s training data can be accessed (although this 
depends on the AI system).355 If the allegedly infringed work is not in the 
training data, that proves there was no copying because the work was 
never accessed.356 Also, even if an AI were trained on a protected work, 
the AI could be queried for the specific works that contributed to a 
particular output and answer the question of whether the AI -generated 
work involved actual copying in addition to access.357 Thus, in the

scenario where a troll posts a billion works to the internet, if it can be 
proven that an allegedly infringing AI- generated work came from a 
generative AI that was not trained on any of the troll’s works, or that the 
troll’s works were not directly used to  generate the new work, there is no 
infringement.  
For instance, in 2018, an  art installation  titled All We’d Ever Need Is 
One Another  was setup to  autonomously generate images using two 
flatbed scanners facing one another that both project ed and reflect ed 
light.358 AI generates mouse movements that randomize scanning settings 
and begin the scanning process.359 AI is then used to detect when a newly 
created image is sufficiently like an existing work of art, after which the 
AI-generated image is “validated as art” and uploaded to the internet and 
social media together with the name of the original artwork it was  
validated against.360 The installation creates around 1,000 to 1,500 
images a day, including twenty to fifty validated images.361 In August 
2018, the creator of the installation, Adam Basanta, was sued in Quebec Superior Court for copyright infringement by artist Amel Chamandy.
362 
One of the installation’s pieces matched with Chamandy’s 2009 
photograph “Your World Without Paper.”363 Given the way the AI -
generated images were made in this case, namely not from existing 
works, the fact a generated image happened to be similar to someone 
else’s existing image is not grounds for infringement (including under 
Canadian law).364 
This case was from several years ago —ancient history in the world of 
generative AI. As increasingly sophisticated AI comes to generate millions, billions, or trillions of images a day, independent creation will become a more prevalent phenomenon. This shou ld lead to increased

consumer choice and a higher degree of fungibility between protected 
works. Taken to its extreme, in a decidedly futuristic scenario where very powerful AI systems can generate astronomical amounts of content, like 
the hypothetical monkeys recreating all t he works of the British

to train generative AI constitutes copyright infringement and that AI -
generated works created “in the style of” human artists are infringing 
derivative works.367 Under U.S. law, whether training AI on protected 
content is infringing likely depends on whether that activity, which 
generally involves making many copies of training data, falls within the 
fair use exception to infringement.368 Internationally, an increasing 
number of jurisdictions have adopted statutory exceptions to copyright 
infringement for “text and data mining,” which narrowly refers to using 
protected content to generate insights but can also refer more broadly to 
using protected content to train AI systems.369 An artist’s “style” is not

are some ways that style is protected under copyright law; but the extent to which the law protects style will become more of an issue as generative

D.AI Owners Are the Most Appropriate Default Copyright Owners
Regardless of authorship, an AI cannot own copyright or any type of
property because it is not a person —legal or artificial.371 While the law 
could change to accommodate some form of legal personality for AI,372 
it still would not be an optimal, or even terribly sensible, way to structure 
rights. Among other things, an AI is not motivated to create or 
disseminate works by the prospect of financial gain.  
By contrast, people tend to be motivated by the prospect of financial 
gain. A variety of stakeholders in the AI -generated work ecosystem are 
potential right holder candidates, including an AI user, owner, or 
programmer. In some cases, the user, owner, and programmer may be the 
same person, or it may be that “the” programmer is a collection of people spread over time and space. Numerous scholars have considered the most 
appropriate right holder for copyright in AI -generated works.
373 Some 
courts have also weighed in on the most appropriate right holder for AI -
 
voiced by creative industries. Rory O’Neill, UK Government Bins UKIPO’s Flagship AI Reforms ,

372.For example, an autonomous vehicle (AV) could require legal personality to hold an
insurance policy to compensate accident victims. Still, A Vs are commercial products, and it works 
out better across the board to have AV manufacturers liable for accidents. See ABBOTT, supra note 
6, at 71–91 (explaining that even though arguments exist for extending legal personhood to robots, 
difficulties remain). But legal personality for AI is the subject of a blossoming field of literature. 
See, e.g., DAVID J. GUNKEL, ROBOT RIGHTS 47 (2018). 
373.For instance, Professor Samuelson considered this question in 1986, noting that
[t]here are at least five ownership allocation possibilities: one might decide to
allocate intellectual property interests in the output to the computer, the user, the
author of the generator program, both jointly, or no one.  . . . The Article
concludes th at, in general, the user of a computer generator program should be
considered the author of a computer generated work, and should be free to exploit
this product commercially.

assisted works involving a variety of human contributors.374 This Article 
argues that the AI owner is the most appropriate default for copyright 
ownership, for both legal and policy reasons.375   
It is often the case that someone other than a work’s author owns its 
copyright.376 Authors can transfer their rights to third parties, and rights 
may transfer automatically.377 Rights may also vest directly in parties 
other than an author. For example, under the rules for a Work Made for 
Hire (WMFH ), employers generally own works made by employees 
within the scope of their employment.378 The same applies to certain 
works made outside of the employment context.379  
The Copyright Act does not explicitly provide rules for allocating 
ownership in AI -generated works. However, it also does not prohibit 
ownership by virtue of common law rules of entitlement.380 It is generally 
the case that where property creates additional property, the owner of the original property is entitled to the subsequent property.
381 This rule, 
sometimes referred to as accession , applies in a variety of contexts.382 If 
a person owns a cow that births a calf, the cow’s owner becomes the calf’s owner.
383 If a person owns a fruit tree that bears fruit, the tree’s owner 
becomes the fruit’s owner. The tree’s owner derives title to the fruit through the tree, but this does not require the tree to execute a written

automatically transfers or initially vests in the tree’s owner by virtue of 
her relationship to the fruit tree.384  
If an AI makes a piece of physical property, such as a 3D printer 
making a painting, the AI’s owner would own that painting. There is no reason why someone should be any less entitled to digital art made by an 
AI. To the contrary, the intangible nature of digital art makes protection 
more important because it is more easily copied than a physical painting. 
First possession could also entitle an AI owner to copyright. “[T]he 
common and civil law (both of which accept the desirability of private 
ownership) have responded with the proposition that the taking 
possession of unowned things is the only possible way  to acquire 
ownership of them.”
385 The rule of first possession is simple, but like 
accession, it is foundational to functioning systems of private property.386 
If an AI makes a piece of property, and if no other party is entitled to 
ownership by virtue of their relationship to the AI, then copyright in a 
work is unowned property that goes to the first party to take possession of the work.
387  
An AI owner might also be entitled to copyright if an AI -generated 
work is considered a WMFH.388 This requires either an employment 
relationship or a written instrument signed by an independent 
contractor.389 An AI cannot execute a contract, and it is not an employee 
in the sense of labor laws, but it could be treated as an employee for the 
limited purpose of the WMFH doctrine.390 The Supreme Court, in 
Community for Creative Non -Violence v. Reid ,391 identified factors that 
characterize an employment relationship under agency law.392 Those

factors, including the employer’s control over the work, the employer’s 
control over the employee, and the status and conduct of the employee, all weigh in favor of AI -generated works being treated as a WMFH. AIs 
are controlled, operated at someone’s direction, and even owned as property. The central concern with over -application of the WMFH 
doctrine is that it has the potential to exploit human authors.
393 Employers 
might acquire copyrights not contemplated at the time of contracting and therefore not reflected in the agreed -upon price for employment or a 
work. However, where an author is an AI that has no legal rights, there 
can be no concern about exploitation.  
Beyond the legal justification for AI owners being default copyright 
holders, they are the most appropriate copyright owners for policy reasons. Having owners as right holders encourages investments in 
developing AI systems —and it encourages owners to lice nse their AI 
systems.
394 All of which should result in the further creation and 
dissemination of works.  
Ultimately, the specific default owner is less important than ensuring 
well-defined property rights.395 That is because copyright is transferable, 
and so where the user, programmer, and owner are different parties, these 
control or  the right to control the work being produced “in many situations is determinative.”
Restatement (Second) of Agency § 220(1) cmt. d (Am. L. Inst. 1965). In 1989, the Supreme Court 
wrote in Reid that central to the resolution of this inquiry of whether a party is engaged as an 
employee or independent contractor is “the hiring party’s right to control the manner and means  
by which the product is accomplished.”  490 U.S. at 751 (emphasis added).  This case marked a 
shift from the actual control required under the Restatement and prior cases to a factor -based 
assessment:  
We turn, finally, to an application of section 101 to Reid’s production of [the 
Nativity sculpture]. In determining whether a hired party is an employee under the general common law of agency, we consider the hiring party’s right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished. Among the other 
factors relevant to this inquiry are the skill required; the sourc e of the 
instrumentalities and tools; the location of the work; the duration of the 
relationship between the parties; whether the hiring party has the right to assign 
additional projects to the hired party; the extent of the hired party’s discretion 
over when and how long to work; the method of payment; the hired party’s role 
in hiring and paying assistants; whether the work is part of the regular business 
of the hiring party; whether the hiring party is in business; the provision of 
employee benefits; and the tax treatment of the hired party. No one of these 
factors is determinative.

parties can contract amongst themselves to an optimal outcome.396 That 
is particularly likely to occur in advance where the prospect of copyright 
is an important incentive for creation or collaboration.397  
E.The Importance of Recognizing AI Authors
If AI-generated works are to be protected, this also raises the question 
of who, or what, should be designated as an author. By definition, in the case of an AI -generated work, an AI user, programmer, or owner would 
not qualify as an author according to traditional criteria. Therefore, this 
requires either n on-traditional criteria for human authorship, no 
authorship requirement, or AI authorship.
398 Some of these options could 
require an amendment to the Copyright Act. 
For example, the Copyright Act could be amended to state that in the 
case of an AI -generated work, the AI user is deemed the author. This has 
the advantage of ensuring protection and a clear allocation of rights, although it allows someone to claim authorship for merely asking an AI 
to generate something creative. That is not unfair to the AI of course, because the AI has no interest in taking credit for the work, but it is unfair 
to other human artists because it changes the meaning of authorship. It 
equates legitimate human creativity with someone simply instructing a 
computer. If someone claimed authorship of every artwork generated by 
DALL·E 2, they would become the most prolific artist in history 
overnight. Of course, the WMFH doctrine makes an employer —whether 
an individual or a corporation —a legal author, even if all the work was 
done by an uncredited employee.
399 
AI-generated works could also be authorless. For example, the 
Copyright Act allows works to be registered anonymously or 
pseudonymously, although only for works created by a natural person and 
not for WMFH.400 Similarly, an applicant could register an AI- generated 
work with no author listed and an explanation of the basis on which they 
claim entitlement. This has the advantage of avoiding dilution of human 
authorship, but not designating an author may prove prob lematic to 
entitlement. If an AI is being used by a third party to generate a work, the 
rightful copyright owner may have no way to know the provenance of the 
work unless the AI is disclosed in a registration or in litigation. Indeed, 
for essentially this reason, the USCO encourages applicants to provide an

author’s name rather than to register a work anonymously, noting that it 
creates a clear record of the authorship and ownership of the copyright.401 
Finally, the factual author (the AI) could be listed as the legal author —
with some surprising benefits. Listing the AI promotes transparency and appropriate entitlement. It not only accurately reports authorship, because the AI is functionally doing the work of a traditional author, but it also 
allows the various stakeholders involved with the AI to have a clear 
record of a work’s origins. This allows stakeholders to claim and enforce 
their rights more appropriately.  
Recognizing AI authors also helps to preserve a human -centric vision 
of authorship. Allowing transparent designation of authorship allows the public to understand how works were created. It also benefits 
policymakers as they struggle with issues related to AI -generated works. 
One of the best ways to track information on the prevalence of AI -
generated works is to allow these works to be registered with AI authors. 
AI authorship has a final advantage in that, depending on the outcome 
of Thaler v. Perlmutter , it may already be permitted under the Copyright 
Act. There is no case law holding that an AI cannot be an author, only dicta supporting the Human Authorship Requirement —much of which 
dates to before the development of AI. Given that AI authorship would 
promote the purpose of the Copyright Act, a court employing a purposive 
approach to statutory interpretation should conclude that it is entirely permissible. Indeed , the Supreme Court has a long history of interpreting 
the terms “writings” and “authors” purposively, and not “in their narrow 
literal sense but, rather, with the reach necessary to reflect the broad scope 
of constitutional principles.”
402 That is particularly important in the case 
of the Copyright Act, which was designed to accommodate technological 
advances.403  
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS  
Our discomfort with the notion of computer -“authored” 
works (even if we cannot articulate a principled reason for 
the discomfort) is in keeping with a recurring phenomenon in the development of copyright law. In every age, a new technology has appeared abo ut which people have expressed 
fear and concern, claiming that it defies the boundaries of the existing legal system. With respect to copyright, these claims were made about photographs, motion pictures, sound

recordings, radio, television, and other telecommunications. 
In each case, the copyright system has managed over time to incorporate the new medium of expression into the existing framework. Most recently, the role of the upstart new technology has been as sumed by computers. For a while, the 
computers- and-copyright battlefield was centered on the 
copyrightability of computer programs as literary works. That contest now has been largely fought and resolved in favor of copyrightability. It may be that the nex t battle will 
be over copyrightability of computer-generated works.

Professor Arthur Miller, 1991 
Technological evolution is often an impetus for reevaluation of 
copyright law.405 AI is now generating creative works in a major way, 
and these works have value to consumers. Today, AI -generated art is 
making a splash on the internet. Tomorrow, AI -generated music will be 
playing on the radio and people will be drawing insights from AI -
generated literature. The relentless improvement of AI means that people 
will increasingly have access to a wealth of useful content. The unique 
characteristics of generative AI, including the self -improving nature of 
AI models and the difficulties associated with attributing their outputs to 
human creators, challenges the existing framework and necessitates a 
thorough rethinking of what rules will result in the greatest social value. 
Encouraging the creation and dissemination of such content is the main purpose of the copyright system, and allowing copyright protection for 
AI-generated works will achieve this purpose. Once the desirability of 
protecting these works is acknowledged, acknowledging AI authorship 
then becomes nothing more than opting for reality instead of elaborate 
legal fictions.
