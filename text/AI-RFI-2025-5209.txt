General Comment
Copyright exists for a reason. If artists can't m ake a living from  their art, that art will disappear.
If you allow plagiarism  m achines to steal wholesale from  the Am erican people, no one will ever play m usic for you again except the guy
playing for free in the park. There will be no new books that aren't published on Wattpad. Movies and TV shows will no longer be
profitable, so say goodbye to m ost popular entertainm ent. It'll be nothing but ever-worsening slop for the rest of your life. I hope you like
the worst Marvel m ovies that have all been run through a blender, because that's what this change will produce.
If you've ever enjoyed a book, song, m ovie, show, or video gam e produced by a living artist, it is in your best interest to stop AI
profiteering now.
