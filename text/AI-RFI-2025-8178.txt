General Comment
As an Am erican who writes professionally for a career and as m y creative vocation, the use of LLMs and other supposedly "generative"
AI is a threat to m y livelihood and that of countless others who work as writers, photographers, illustrators, and other artists. I urge you to
consider in m aking this plan: 
1) I strongly oppose the training of AI by using creative work from  writers and artists without our perm ission. This is ongoing theft on a
widespread scale and it's a direct attack on intellectual property rights.
2) What's m ore, the supposed "art" created by generative AI program s looks terrible, the writing they produce is worthless, and the
supposed answers provided by AI search and chatbots are often inaccurate or even hazardous. Google's AI Overview has encouraged
users to eat rocks and to eat glue, for exam ple. The Gem ini AI chatbot encouraged at least one user to kill them selves. AI program s have
propagated lies such as the claim  that form er President Obam a is a Muslim , as well as using racist slurs. Generative AI has also invented
fake academ ic research studies that never existed, leading to real confusion for students and reporters trying to cite real studies.
3) Meanwhile, these program s waste large am ounts of water and electricity.
4) Generative AI has been overhyped by unethical com panies to fleece the Am erican public.
3) Generative AI has no place in the future of our country's technological developm ent.
