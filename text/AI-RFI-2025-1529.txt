General Comment
At this tim e, so-called “artificial intelligence” is not ready for the m ajority of tasks that are put before it by the public, as it has no real
UNDERSTANDING. It is not intelligent by any m etric. Just as a cookie cutting robot can cut dough on a conveyor belt that is at a
specific location, speed, and dough density, so too can “artificial intrlligence” like Grok and ChatGPT answer questions and perform  tasks
correctly when asked questions pre-selected to m atch their training data perfectly.
Hum ans trust authorities, and these AI program s are given authority by their m akers, despite being dead wrong, consistently, when asked
questions the creators did not anticipate. 
It regurgitates what hum ans have already m ade, without the nuance or contextual awareness of a hum an looking at the problem  and
developm ent to give it actual understanding has stalled. 
Do NOT give AI m ore power, or reach. Give it MORE legal lim its if at all possible. 
The m akers of AI cannot be trusted to represent its capabilities accurately to laym en.
