General Comment
AI is a dead-end technology at the end of its hype cycle. Com panies and investors are throwing m oney at this tool hoping to stum ble onto
a way to m ake m oney; none have succeeded so far and new m odels show that building bigger m odels yields fewer and fewer returns.
There is nowhere for it to go from  here except the way of NFTs and crypto.
