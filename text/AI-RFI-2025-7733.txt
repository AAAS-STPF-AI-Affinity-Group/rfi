General Comment
Allowing AI to be trained on copyrighted m aterial is a gross overstep of copyright law that will do im m ense, irreparable harm  to
individuals in creative fields everywhere. As an artist, I don't want m y work to be used in AI training. It's m y hours and hours of hard
work and dedication. I am  granted ownership and proprietorship and the ability to choose what is and is not acceptable to use for m y
artwork under copyright law. AI com panies should not be above the law. If they want to use copyrighted works, they should be held to
the sam e standards and processes that ANY com m ercialized sector is held to: they need express perm ission from  the creator and
potentially licensing. Allowing com panies to ignore these long-standing, standard system s to protect copyrighted work is unfair to the
creatives, as they are not being com pensated for their work; m eanwhile, it is being used for the profit of others.
