To Whom it May Concern,
I am writing to propose the establishment of a "National AI Data Consortium" that leverages
citizen participation to aggregate and curate high-quality datasets for artificial intelligence(AI) training. This initiative aims to address the critical data scarcity hindering AIadvancement and to foster a sense of national contribution among citizens.
The Challenge: Data Scarcity in AI Development:Artificial intelligence relies heavily on vast amounts of high-quality data for training and
refinement. However, there is a significant shortage of such data, which threatens to slow therapid pace of AI advancement. A report by Pymnts.com highlights that data scarcity is a majorobstacle to AI innovation, potentially impeding progress in various sectors.
The Proposal:
 
Citizen-Driven Data Collection:To overcome this challenge, I propose the creation of a national consortium that:
Aggregates and Curates Data: Collects diverse datasets from various sectors,
including healthcare, education, and public services, ensuring they are anonymized andprivacy-protected.
Incentivizes Citizen Participation : Encourages citizens to contribute data through
rewards such as tax breaks, micro-payments, or gamified platforms, thereby fostering asense of national contribution.
Benefits of the Consortium:
Enhanced AI Development: Access to comprehensive datasets will accelerate AItraining, leading to more accurate and effective models.
Economic Growth: AI has the potential to create 133 million new jobs by 2030, withspecialized roles in AI and big data expected to grow by 30-35%.
Empowered Citizens: Engaging the public in data collection empowers individuals andcommunities, promoting shared responsibility.
Conclusion
By establishing the National AI Data Consortium, we can harness the collective power of our
citizens to propel the United States to the forefront of AI innovation. This initiative not onlyaddresses the pressing need for quality data but also cultivates a collaborative spirit thatbenefits all.


Thank you for considering this proposal. I would be more than happy to assist with bringing
this plan to fruition.
Sincerely,Chad Brewer
