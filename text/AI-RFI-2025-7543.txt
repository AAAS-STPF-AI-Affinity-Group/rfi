General Comment
I do not agree with the developm ent of an AI action plan due to m any reasons that are against what AI is. Such as:
* Holding AI in a place in the future of the US instead of the people them selves who trained in helping the federal governm ent, including
those that used to work in the federal governm ent
* AI can steal livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft, causing leeway of conglom erate com panies take advantage to pass
through copyright laws.
* AI is m ostly used for recreational things and nothing m ore. Just a fad in the eyes of the Am erican public.
Most of all, having AI be used for federal and governm ent agencies are incredibly terrifying thought as there are inaccuracies that could
cause errors and m istakes to the Am erican system s.
I cannot support this developm ent.
