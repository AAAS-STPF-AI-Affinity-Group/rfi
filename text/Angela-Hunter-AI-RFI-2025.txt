I’m writing about the proposed AI Action Plan. AI development should not be done in a way  
that is reckless, and copyright should be respected in its development. If AI companies cannot  
train their models without infringing copyright, then they need to pay copyright or find  
another business model. 
We need to protect the work of artists and writers (and publishers, etc), not exploit and steal it  
for the profit of companies developing AI.  This is not in the national interest. Regulations  
should  protect these sectors rather than being trampled in the name of supposed “innovation.”
This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-
