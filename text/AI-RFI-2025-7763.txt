General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. The technology is too unreliable at this tim e to be used at scale in any capacity,
least of all in large-scale practice, which is where m any com panies are looking to em ploy it. On an individual scale, GenAI steals from  m y
livelihood as an Am erican and creative, and profits off of that theft without com pensation or otherwise due recourse â€” this is plagiarism
and renders the entire concept of ownership m oot. For a country that believes and relies heavily on the capitalist value of ownership, it
m akes zero sense to allow AI to be left to its own devices unfettered and without robust and detailed regulations and protections. AI is
not ready, and hum ans are not yet evolved enough to use it responsibly. AI is not welcom e here.
