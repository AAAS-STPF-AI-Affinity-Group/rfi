General Comment
The action taking place is a violation of the Fifth Am endm ent of the Constitution. According to it: 
"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infam ous crim e, unless on a presentm ent or indictm ent of a Grand Jury,
except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in tim e of War or public danger; nor shall any
person be subject for the sam e offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or lim b; nor shall be com pelled in any crim inal case to be a
witness against him self, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for
public use, without just com pensation."
That last part regarding private property is im portant, as trying to disable copyrighted work without paym ent. Also the fact that AI is not
considered copyright protected does not really benefit this plan. If anything, it m akes it m ore likely to cause degradation of the AI m arket
and flatline it.
