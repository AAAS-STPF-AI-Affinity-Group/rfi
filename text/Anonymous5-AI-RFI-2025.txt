As an engineering student and  I’ve been following the path for the last 6 years on Artificial 
Intelligence. In the United States AI Action Plan, should be clear steps to get us ahead in the 
energy race, and as fast as possible. China is building a heavy energy industry already and fas t. “ 
The Chinese government has implemented comprehensive policies to bolster AI development. 
The “Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan,” issued in 2017, outlines 
China’s ambition to become a global leader in AI by 2030. This plan empha sizes the integration 
of AI across various sectors, including smart manufacturing, quantum computing, biotechnology, 
and space exploration, demonstrating a commitment to technological sovereignty and economic 
resilience. ” Another point of reference is the  according: Between 2013 and 2021, China invested 
approximately $679 billion in infrastructure projects across transportation, energy, and other 
sectors, significantly surpassing the U.S. investment of $76 billion in the same areas.” We need 
to scale up as  quickly as possible, it could either end up with them being so far ahead in the AGI 
race or Us, and who knows what that could mean for areas including cyber, militarily, for 
technology like quantum and encryption, and all of the sorts. China has no troubl e already 
illicitly poking at our cyber infrastructure and companies in the tech sector. China is already 
moving rapidly and at this point we should be too.
