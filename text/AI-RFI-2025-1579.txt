General Comment
I oppose this plan. This will not allow the private sector to better use AI. This will legally let China steal our intellectual property to sell
back to us in the guise of AI Training. Do we really want China to have that power? I say no. Keep it as it was. Donâ€™t let China or
Canada or Mexico steal ideas and products from  hard working Am ericans in the private sector! Keep Am erica Great!
