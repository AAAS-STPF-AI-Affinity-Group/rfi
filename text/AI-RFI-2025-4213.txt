General Comment
I am  writing to say do NOT allow these Generative AI tech bro's the ability to steal and profit off of other people's hard work! Generative
AI is GARBAGE and devoid of the ability to produce any positive reactions, just uncanny ones! Real artists do NOT need their hard
work ground up in a m achine to spit out som e grotesque approxim ation of art. LEAVE THE COPYWRITE LAWS ALONE!
