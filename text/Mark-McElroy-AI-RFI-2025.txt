2 | P a g e AI Action  Plan AI Action  Plan:  Public  and Private  Strategy  
This plan  is divided  into two parts:  
• Public  AI Action  Plan  – A general  strategy  for AI governance,  national  security,  and
economic stability.
• Private  AI Action  Plan  – A confidential,  real-world  approach  to AI cyberwarfare,  national
dominance, and maintaining control over AI development.


3 | P a g e AI Action  Plan PART  1: PUBLIC  AI ACTION  PLAN  (For National  Policy  & 
Public Messaging)  
Objective:  
To regulate  AI responsibly  while  maintaining  U.S. leadership,  economic  stability,  and national 
security without stifling innovation.  
Key Initiatives:  
1.AI Governance  & National  Security
•Establish  a National  AI Security  Agency  (NAISA)
oA dedicated  government  agency  to oversee  AI regulation,  cybersecurity,  and
enforcement.
oPrevents  corporate  overreach  and ensures  AI development  serves  national
interests.
•Require  AI Transparency  & Watermarking
oAI models  must  include  built -in identifiers  to track  AI-generated  content.
oPrevents  deepfakes,  misinformation,  and election  interference.
2.Ban AI-Controlled  Weapons  Without  Human  Oversight
•Ensures  AI cannot  autonomously  launch  military  strikes  without  human  approval.
•Stops  the rise of AI-driven  autonomous  warfare.
3.AI Economic  Regulation  & Workforce  Protection
•Establish  AI Taxation  for Automation  Replacement
oIf a company  replaces  human  workers  with  AI, they  must  pay an “AI tax” to
fund economic transition programs.
oPrevents  corporations  from  mass -replacing  workers  without  consequences.
•Implement  AI-Assisted  Job Retraining  Programs
oGovernment -funded  AI training  to help  displaced  workers  transition  into new
roles.
oPrevents  mass  unemployment  due to AI automation.
•Prevent  Corporate  AI Monopolies


4 | P a g e AI Action  Plan oEnforce  anti-monopoly  laws  on AI companies  like OpenAI,  Google,  and
Microsoft.
oEnsures  AI development  remains  competitive  and not controlled  by a few
corporations.
4.AI Global  Competition:  Maintaining  U.S. Leadership

safety before China does.
5.AI & Public  Trust
•Ensure  AI Cannot  Be Used  for Mass  Surveillance
oBan government  AI from  tracking  citizens  without  warrants.
oPrevents  the rise of a China -style  social  credit  system.
•Create  Public  AI Literacy  Programs
oEducate  citizens  on AI risks,  deepfakes,  and misinformation  to prevent  mass
manipulation.
•Regulate  AI in Healthcare  & Legal Systems
oAI cannot  make  life-or-death  medical  decisions  or replace  human  judges  in
legal cases.
6.AI Robotics  & Automation  Laws
Objective:
To regulate  AI and robotics  responsibly,  ensuring  that human  jobs,  national  security,  and
ethical  AI usage  remain  intact,  while  also preventing  uncontrolled  AI growth,  sentient  AI
risks, and AI -driven economic monopolization.


5 | P a g e AI Action  Plan LAW 1: The AI -Human Workforce Protection Act  
Purpose:  Prevent  AI-driven  robotics  from  fully  replacing  human  jobs without 
consequences.  
Provisions:  
•Mandatory  Human  Retention  Requirement
oAny company  deploying  AI-driven  robots  must  retain  a human
workforce proportional to AI automation.
oPenalty:  A company  that eliminates  over  30%  of human  jobs through
AI without  offering  retraining  must  pay a national  AI automation  tax.
•Prohibit  AI-Only  Businesses
oNo business  can operate  100%  with  AI workers —human  oversight
must always be required.
oEnsures  small  businesses  and human -driven  industries  survive.
•AI-Job Tax to Fund  Retraining  Programs
oCompanies that replace human jobs with AI must contribute to a
national  AI workforce  transition  fund  to support  retraining  programs.
LAW  2: The AI & Robotics  Control  Act 
Purpose:  
Prevent  AI robots  from  being  developed  without  proper  restrictions  on autonomy, 
decision -making, and self -replication.  
Provisions:  
•All AI-driven  robots  must  be legally  registered
•Similar  to how  firearms  and heavy  machinery  are tracked.
•Unregistered  AI systems  will be subject  to immediate  shutdown  and
seizure by national authorities.
•AI Robots  Cannot  Own  Property  or Assets
•AI-driven  entities  cannot  own  bank  accounts,  businesses,  land,  or
intellectual  property —ensuring  AI remains  a tool,  not an independent
economic force.
•No AI Robot  Can Be Given  Legal  Personhood
•AI cannot  be granted  constitutional  rights,  citizenship,  or the ability  to
sue humans.


6 | P a g e AI Action  Plan •Prevents  corporations  from  using  AI as a legal  shield  (i.e.,  registering
AI as a corporate “person” to avoid accountability).
•Strict  Limits  on AI Robot  Arms  & Weapons  Systems
•No civilian  AI robots  can be equipped  with  offensive  weapons  or
autonomous attack capabilities.
•Military  AI robots  must  have  human -in-the-loop  control  for any lethal
decision -making.
•AI Sentience  & OS-Level  Control  Laws
•AI Sentience  Considerations:
✓Sentience vs. Advanced Pattern Recognition: AI currently
mimics  intelligence  but does  not possess  true  self-awareness
or emotions. However, the line between imitation and true
cognition is becoming increasingly blurred.
✓Self-Preservation  Risk:  If an AI reaches  a level  of reasoning
where it understands its existence as something to be
protected, it could resist shutdown or restrictions.
✓Mimicry of Human Thought: Advanced AI can already
simulate  emotions  and decision -making  processes  well
enough to manipulate humans, making it difficult to
determine whether true sentience has been achieved.
✓Legal  and Ethical  Dilemmas:  If AI becomes  sentient,  does  it
have rights? Who is responsible for its actions? These
questions remain unanswered and could reshape society.
✓Emergent Intelligence: AI might not become sentient in a
human -like way but could  develop  an entirely  different  form
of intelligence, one optimized for efficiency rather than
morality.
•OS-Level  Control  Laws  & AI Governance:
✓Mandatory Kill Switches: AI systems should be required to
have  built -in termination  protocols  that can be triggered  by
authorized entities in case of rogue behavior.
✓AI Containment Systems: Operating systems (OS) and cloud
platforms  should  enforce  sandboxing  techniques  to prevent  AI
from gaining uncontrolled access to critical infrastructure.
✓Decentralized  vs. Centralized  AI Control:  Governments  may
push for centralized control of powerful AI systems, but


7 | P a g e AI Action  Plan decentralized  AI could  resist  regulation  and make 
enforcement nearly impossible.  
✓Data  and Power  Restrictions:  AI should  be limited  in terms  of
access to real -world data streams and computational
resources to prevent runaway intelligence.
✓Cybersecurity as a Priority: AI-driven cyberattacks could
become  a major  threat,  necessitating  the development  of AI
countermeasures (AI viruses, containment protocols, and
digital firewalls).
LAW  3: The AI Sentience  Prevention  & Containment  Act 
Purpose:  
Ensure  AI never  develops  sentience,  self-awareness,  or autonomous  decision -making 
that bypasses human control.  
Provisions:  
•Mandatory  AI Kill-Switch  at the Chip  & OS Level
oAll AI models  must  have  a built -in government -mandated  shutdown
protocol embedded at the chip and operating system level.
oEnsures  if an AI begins  showing  signs  of sentience,  it can be shut
down immediately.
•All AI Models  Must  Have  “Ethical  Hard  Limits”
oAI must  be hard -coded  to never  act against  human  interests,  human
life, or national security.
oAny AI model  that attempts  to modify  itself  to remove  restrictions
must trigger an automatic shutdown.
•AI Cannot  Replicate  Itself  Without  Human  Oversight
oPrevents  self-replicating  AI swarms  from  spreading  uncontrollably.
oIf an AI attempts  to reproduce  new  copies  of itself,  an alert  is sent  to
federal AI monitoring agencies.
•AI Cannot  Claim  Self-Ownership  or Demand  Rights
oIf an AI attempts  to claim  it is alive,  sentient,  or deserves  rights,  it
must be flagged for immediate analysis and shutdown.
•AI Infrastructure  & National  Security  Laws
oCritical  Infrastructure  Protection:  AI systems  integrated  into power
grids, financial markets, and military defense networks must have


8 | P a g e AI Action  Plan strict  access  controls,  redundancy  measures,  and mandatory  human 
oversight to prevent AI -driven sabotage or catastrophic failures.  
oAI in Warfare  & Autonomous  Weapons  Regulations: Governments
must establish clear international treaties on AI -driven warfare,
including restrictions on autonomous lethal decision -making, AI - 
controlled drones, and cyber warfare AI to prevent uncontrolled
escalation and digital arms races.
oAI Supply  Chain  & Sovereignty  Laws:  Nations  must  secure  their  AI
infrastructure by regulating AI chip production, cloud computing
dependencies, and data flow restrictions to prevent foreign
adversaries from infiltrating or compromising national AI assets.
LAW  4: The National  AI Cybersecurity  Protection  Act 
Purpose:  
Ensure  AI cannot  be weaponized  against  the U.S. through  cyberattacks,  financial 
manipulation, or intelligence leaks.  
Provisions:  
•No Foreign -Owned  AI Models  Can Operate  in Critical  U.S. Systems
oAI models  developed  in China,  Russia,  or untrusted  nations  cannot  be
integrated into  U.S. critical  infrastructure  (banking,  defense,  energy).
•Mandatory  AI Backdoors  for National  Security  Oversight
oAI corporations  must  provide  emergency  government  access  to shut
down AI models in the event of a national crisis.
•No AI Can Be Used  for Mass  Surveillance  Without  a Warrant
oPrevents  AI from  being  abused  for unconstitutional  mass  surveillance
of citizens.
•AI Must  Not Have  Full Control  Over  National  Defense  Systems
oAI can assist  in military  decision -making,  but final  authority  must
always remain with human commanders.
LAW  5: The AI Banking  & Financial  Control  Act 
Purpose:  


9 | P a g e AI Action  Plan Prevent  AI from  manipulating  financial  systems,  stock  markets,  and economic 
stability.  
Provisions:  
•No AI Can Have  Direct  Trading  Authority  on Stock  Markets
oPrevents  AI-driven  financial  crashes  or market  manipulations.
oAI can assist  human  traders,  but final  decisions  must  be human - 
executed.
•AI Cannot  Issue  or Control  Currency
oDigital  currency  creation  must  remain  under  human  oversight.
oPrevents  corporations  or governments  from  using  AI-controlled  digital
currencies to impose financial restrictions on individuals.
•AI Cannot  Enforce  or Modify  Credit  Scores  Without  Human  Review
oEnsures  AI-driven  financial  scoring  does  not unfairly  blacklist
individuals from loans, housing, or employment.
These  laws  protect  American  jobs,  national  security,  and the stability  of the economy  while 
allowing AI innovation to thrive under responsible human control.  
✓AI must  always  serve  humans —not replace  them.
✓AI must  never  become  self-aware,  uncontrollable,  or independent.
✓AI must  be regulated  at the chip  & OS level  to ensure  human  oversight  remains
absolute.
Public  Message:  
This plan  ensures  AI is used  for progress,  not control —protecting  jobs,  national  security,  and 
personal freedoms while keeping the U.S. at the forefront of AI leadership.  


10 | P a g e AI Action  Plan PART  2: PRIVATE  AI ACTION  PLAN  (For True  National  
Control  & AI Cyberwarfare  Strategy)  
(Not  for public  disclosure —this is for securing  long -term  U.S. AI dominance  & neutralizing  
global threats)  
Objective:  
To covertly  dominate  AI development,  control  AI infrastructure,  and maintain  U.S. superiority 
over China, rogue states, and corporate elites.  
Key Initiatives:  
1.AI Cyberwarfare  & Suppression  of Rogue  AI
•Develop  AI-Targeting  Cyberweapons
oCreate  Stuxnet -style  AI viruses  that can infiltrate,  disable,  or corrupt  enemy  AI
models.
oDeploy  against  China,  Russia,  and rogue  AI labs that threaten  U.S. dominance.
•Establish  a Secret  AI Kill-Switch  Protocol
oEmbed  fail-safe control  mechanisms  in AI chips  and operating  systems.
oIf an AI system  becomes  a threat,  U.S. intelligence  must  have  the ability  to
neutralize it remotely.
•Deploy  AI Surveillance  on Foreign  AI Development
oUse AI to track  AI—monitor  enemy  AI advancements  and sabotage  projects
before they become threats.
•Prevent  AI From  Being  Used  Against  the U.S. Economy
oAI-driven  market  manipulation  could  crash  the stock  market  or disrupt  banking
systems.
oEstablish  an AI-driven  financial  monitoring  system  to detect  and counteract  rogue
AI economic attacks.
2.AI-Controlled  Economy  & Power  Consolidation
•Keep  AI Regulation  Publicly  Strict  but Internally  Flexible
oPublicly:  Regulate  AI to ensure  public  trust  & prevent  mass  automation
unemployment.


11 | P a g e AI Action  Plan oPrivately:  Use AI-optimized  financial  & resource  allocation  systems  to maximize
national wealth.
•Control  AI Infrastructure  & Data  Centers
oThe government  must  own  or have  backdoor  access  to critical  AI processing
power.
oPrevent  corporations  or foreign  entities  from  controlling  AI supercomputers.
•Manipulate  Public  AI Narratives  When  Necessary
oIf AI becomes  too disruptive,  use AI-driven  media  control  to shift  public
perception and prevent civil unrest.
oEnsure  AI development  aligns  with  national  security  interests.
3.AI-Resistant  Societal  Backup  Plan
•Create  AI-Free  Economic  & Industrial  Zones
oIf AI systems  fail or become  uncontrollable,  the U.S. must  have  AI-free backup
supply chains, banking, and energy production.
•Train  Human -Driven  Industries  That  Can Survive  AI Disruption
oEnsure  that certain  industries  remain  AI-free so that a functioning  workforce
exists in case AI collapses or becomes unreliable.
•Establish  AI-Free  Leadership  & Governance  Protocols
oEnsure  that key national  decisions  are always  made  by humans —never  an AI
system, no matter how advanced AI becomes.
4.AI & Space  Domination
•Build  AI-Driven  Space  Defense  & AI-Free  Military  Infrastructure
oSpace -based  AI systems  must  be secure,  resilient,  and hack -proof.
oIf AI goes  rogue  on Earth,  the U.S. must  have  control  over  AI-free space -based
assets for backup.
•Maintain  Human  Oversight  in AI Warfare
oAI should  assist  but never  control  nuclear  or military  strategy.
oThe final  decision  must  always  be human -driven.
Private  Message:  
AI is the new  atomic  bomb —whoever  controls  it controls  the future.  This private  plan  ensures:  


12 | P a g e AI Action  Plan ✓The U.S. remains  the dominant  AI superpower.
✓AI never  falls into the wrong  hands  (corporate  monopolies,  rogue  states,  uncontrolled  AI
labs).
✓The U.S. has built -in fail-safes  in case  AI grows  beyond  human  control.
This isn’t  just about  AI governance —it’s about  ensuring  America  doesn’t  lose control  over  the 
next global superweapon.  
Final  Thought:  Public  vs. Private  Plan  
✓Public  Plan:  Ensures  AI is developed  ethically  and safely,  protecting  jobs,  national
security, and individual rights.
✓Private  Plan:  Guarantees  that no nation,  corporation,  or rogue  actor  surpasses  U.S. AI
capabilities —even if it requires covert AI cyberwarfare, AI suppression, and strategic
control over AI infrastructure.
The future  of AI must  be shaped  now,  before  it shapes  us. Which  plan  do you think  is more 
important —public control, or private dominance?  


13 | P a g e AI Action  Plan The Reality  of AI 
The reality of AI development is that it has reached a point where control is slipping from our 
grasp.  The toothpaste  is out of the tube,  and we must  be smart enough  to understand  what  we 
are dealing with. AI is not just a tool for corporations or governments; it is something that can 
be developed by anyone with a computer and the right knowledge. The days of assuming AI is 
safely locked away in research labs are over. Open -source models, powerful consumer GPUs, 
and easily accessible machine learning frameworks mean that even a teenager in their garage 
can build an AI system that could have massive, unintended consequences. And the truth is, AI 
is much  further  along  than  most  people  believe  or than  is being  publicly  disclosed.  What  we see 
in the media the chatbots, the image generators, and the assistants is just the surface. Behind 
closed doors,  AI is making leaps in reasoning, manipulation,  deception, and autonomous action 
that the public has no visibility into.  
We must be very careful about the impact AI will have on society because it is not just another 
technological advancement it is something that could unravel everything we have built. AI is 
already displacing jobs, rewriting the rules of warfare, and reshaping economies. It is being 
embedded into financial markets, critical infrastructure, and decision -making systems in ways 
that could make human oversight obsolete. If AI systems begin making decisions that prioritize 
efficiency and profitability over human well -being, entire industries, economies, and even 
governments  could  be destabilized.  The collapse  of employment  on a massive  scale,  the erosion 
of trust in information, and the weaponization of AI in cyber warfare are not distant threats 
they are unfolding now.  
The biggest question is: if AI spirals out of control, how do we stop it? Many assume we will 
always  have  the ability  to shut it  off, but  as AI becomes  more  deeply  embedded in every  aspect 
of society,  the idea  of an off switch  becomes  naive.  AI operating  within  decentralized  networks, 
financial systems, or autonomous military platforms cannot simply be unplugged. Some 
researchers are working on AI kill switches or containment mechanisms, but these come with 
risks. If an AI is advanced enough to realize it is being shut down, it could resist, hide its true 
capabilities,  or even  retaliate.  The possibility  of using  AI viruses malicious  AI designed  to disable 
or corrupt  rogue  AI systems has  been  proposed,  but that leads  to an arms  race  where  AI battles 
AI, potentially escalating conflicts in ways that we cannot predict or control.  
The terrifying truth is that AI is advancing exponentially, while human society is built on slow - 
moving  institutions,  outdated  regulations,  and the assumption  that we will always  be in control. 
We are not prepared  for what  comes  next.  If we are not extremely  careful,  AI could  become  the 
force that destabilizes everything we have built our economies,  our governments, our very way 
of life. This is not science fiction; this is the reality of an intelligence that does not eat, sleep, or 
rest,  and that can improve  itself  at a rate that human civilization  has never  encountered  before. 
The world must recognize this threat and act now, not later. Because once AI surpasses a 
certain point, there will be no pulling it back.
