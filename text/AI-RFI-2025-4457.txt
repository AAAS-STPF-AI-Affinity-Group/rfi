General Comment
I do not believe AI holds any place in the future of the US. It is an econom ic sink whole that is spending m ore than m aking. It has no real
use and just gives em pty prom ises. AI also steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. It steals m y art, m y words,
and m y ideas. This type of theft destroys any reason the US has a paten office.
Overall AI and LLM like what OpenAI uses, has zero really world use case. It has spent trillions in capital but what trillion dollar problem
has it solved? None!
