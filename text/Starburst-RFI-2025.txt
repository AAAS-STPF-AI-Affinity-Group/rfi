Access data wherever it livesAccess data wherever it lives
Government data is often fragmented across 
multiple agencies, legacy systems, and secure cloud environments. Starburst feeds real-time queries and AI models across data silos—without requiring costly and time-consuming data movement. Agencies can unify data from any structure across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.
Meet security & compliance standardsMeet security & compliance standards
Government agencies manage vast amounts of sensitive, mission-critical data, requiring strict security, governance, and compliance controls. Starburst enables secure, real-time access across distributed environments, combining fine-grained access control, strong data governance, and a zero-trust model to safeguard data while ensuring AI-driven insights remain accurate, compliant, and efficiently governed across hybrid, cloud, and on-premises systems.
Build the foundation for analytics & AI Build the foundation for analytics & AI 
Whether detecting fraud, monitoring cybersecurity threats, or optimizing defense logistics, agencies require instant insights from all available data sources.  
Starburst powers real-time analytics and AI insights by eliminating data bottlenecks, reducing compute time from hours to seconds, and enabling agencies to leverage AI and machine learning models without waiting for data to be centralized.
Adopt a cost-effective & future-proof Adopt a cost-effective & future-proof 
data architecturedata architecture
Data duplication, migration, and warehouse dependencies drive up costs and slow down modernization efforts. Starburst eliminates redundant storage expenses and extends the lifespan of legacy systems by allowing agencies to choose whether to query data directly where it resides or centralize it on a modern foundation based on Apache Iceberg—reducing costs while enhancing choice.Accelerate mission-critical 
decisions with secure AI-ready data
Solving the most pressing data Solving the most pressing data 
challenges in governmentchallenges in government
Government agencies rely on data to make mission-critical decisions. 
Whether that data is used to feed Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards, 
data applications, or Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, the goal is the same–clarity of insight. 
However, disparate data sources, legacy infrastructure, and evolving 
security mandates all create obstacles to real-time analysis and faster 
insights. Adding to this, traditional data access models often require costly and time-consuming data centralization, delaying essential intelligence, slowing operational efficiency, and increasing security risks and compliance issues. Importantly, this is true whether the data involved is used to feed analytics or AI models. In both cases, the project risks stem from data architectural problems. 
Starburst eliminates these obstacles by providing a secure, high-performance 
foundation for all your data—both for analytics and AI. This allows agencies to unify and analyze datasets spread across legacy, cloud, and secure environments without requiring migration, giving them greater flexibility and control over their data initiatives. With improved access to data, agencies can: 
•Deliver real-time insights for national security, fraud detection,
and government operations by seamlessly accessing all available
data wherever it lives.
•Enhance AI models for regulatory compliance, public health monitoring,
emergency response, cybersecurity, fraud detection, and defense intelligenceby ensuring AI is trained on the most current, comprehensive datasets.
•Reduce operational costs by eliminating redundant data storage and
optimizing analytics at scale.
•Accelerate AI-driven decision-making by providing instant access to
mission-critical information—without the delays of traditional data pipelines.
Whether suppor ting regulatory compliance, defense, cybersecurity, fraud 
investigations, public health initiatives, or emergency response, Starburst 
empowers agencies to access, analyze, and act on their data instantly—fueling AI-driven innovation while ensuring security and compliance.Eliminate data silos and unlock Eliminate data silos and unlock
