General Comment
Please vot no on this bill that will allow ai com oanies to steal from  the hard working people creating art or writing. To allow ai to bypass
copyright laws is a blatant spit in the face of the copyright itself. At that point get rid of copyright laws entirely. Ai is also overhyped, to
allow this to pass is the governm ent condoning theft. This is jot to m ention the m assive security concerns ai creates and that ghe ai m arket
is highly speculative. I would hate to see tax payers dollard be used to pass som ething like this that will steal and steal until theres notbing
left just for a quick buck. Generative ai should not be a part of am erica's future and this bill is an insult to all am erican who have a soul
