General Comment
AI system s can only be produced by training work m ade by real hum ans. The work of creators are being feed into AI system s without
consent or com pensation. Unregulated AI will hurt creators from  sm all to big. It is not "fair use" when an AI generator takes copyrighted
work without consent and com pensation and uses it to train its system . A system  that allows individual creators an option to give consent
or not in using their creations to train AI is necessary to protect individuals. Com panies should also provide transparent reports disclosing
AI content and how the AI was trained.
