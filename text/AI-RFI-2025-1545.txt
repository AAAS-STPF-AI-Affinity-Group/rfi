General Comment
As a writer and creative professional in the anim ation industry, I want to underscore the need for AI to have strict rules regarding the
ownership of m aterial that it can train on. AI being able to train on works not owned by the AI com pany and works that are under
copyright am ounts to theft. This theft of intellectual property underm ines and degrades the work of the m illions of artists, creatives, and
writers in the USA. Without strict rules ensuring that AI can only train on m aterial properly owned by the AI com panies, AI will cause
irreparable harm  to our econom y.
