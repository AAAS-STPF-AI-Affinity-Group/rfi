General Comment
Using AI to steal from  artists , writers , people in the tech industry would be a colossal m istake . It is lazy and pathetic and generates way
too m uch power and is contributing to destroying the environm ent . What happened to pulling ourselves up by the bootstraps are we really
gonna let a m achine do all the work for us. Great feats by hum anity weâ€™re not m ade by m achine but created by hum an ingenuity.
