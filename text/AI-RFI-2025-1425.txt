General Comment
I donâ€™t think com panies (especially those being investigated for being a m onopoly) should be able to bypass all copyright laws to train
their product (and som ething THEY m ake m oney from !) on creators and publishers with nothing in return for those creators and
publishers.I think this would reduce the internet to whatever one com pany thinks should be posted, said or created. I think this would be
incredibly dangerous and give way to m uch power to certain com panies (again, who are already being investigated as a m onopoly).
