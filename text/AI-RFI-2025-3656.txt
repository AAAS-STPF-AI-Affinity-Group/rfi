General Comment
please don't go through with this. generative ai is theft. it is putting people out of work, and it doesn't even do a good job. it often
produces asinine drivel that only looks goid in passing and doesn't hold up to scrutiny. this is true of both generative im aging and LLMs.
please i am  a citizen and i am  begging you to put a stop to this m adness. things are already bad enough, we don't need this too!
