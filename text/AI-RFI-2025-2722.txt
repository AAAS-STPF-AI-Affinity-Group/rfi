General Comment
I am  a citizen of the state of California. I believe that A.I. can change the world in wonderful and positive ways, provided it is handled and
designed in a safe, ethical, and unbiased way. However, given what I've seen from  A.I. in recent years, I feel not enough is being done to
hold those in charge of these digital system s accountable. To rem ove the ability to hold these com panies accountable for any issues that
m ay arise from  their product sets an extrem ely dangerous precedent, especially considering the reach and power their product holds.
Without accountability, com panies like OpenAI or XAI could sim ply program  their A.I.s to say what they want them  to say, regardless of
the truth. Com bine this with the ease by which bots can proliferate on social m edia, and you have a potential situation where the truth is
drowned out by bots designed to spread and convincingly defend lies. No hum an being should be subjected to this.
A.I. is a powerful tool, and can do great good for the world if handled properly. Passing this proposition sim ply opens the door for A.I.
com panies to abuse their own product, and those who rely on it.
