General Comment
Artists and those in the creative industry deserve better than to have their work stolen under the auspices of this adm inistration. AI
threatens everyoneâ€™s creative freedom  by closing doors and gatekeeping culture to people who contribute and create the very things it
steals. This is not innovation.
