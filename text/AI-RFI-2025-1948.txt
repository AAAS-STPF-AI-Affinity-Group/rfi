General Comment
AI wastes so m any valuable resources while claim ing to be a valuable resource. It's not, and it creates m ore dam age than anything of
actual value. We need protections from  scam  artists in this industry, and AI is one of the biggest scam s in our recent years. They cannot
claim  copyright when their entire product is founded in stealing from  everything and everyone around them , they own nothing and steal
everything.
