General Comment
Google and other AI com panies have destroyed m y online publishing business.
My business em ployed up to 10 Am erican content producers at its peak. I’ve produced over 700 hum an-written online articles that took
considerable tim e, expertise, and expense to produce for the benefit of m y readers.
Google and other for-profit AI com panies have scraped m y content without providing com pensation, and are profiting trem endously from
the toil of Am ericans that I’ve had to term inate from  em ploym ent due to growing lack of online traffic generated due to the changes to
Google’s now AI first algorithm .
This is one of the biggest injustices in the m odern landscape and m y hope is that regulators will step in to ensure creators are duly
com pensations for the value we’ve provided in enabling these AI com panies to grow. 
Or else, the future of the diverse creator econom y is certainly doom ed to perish.
