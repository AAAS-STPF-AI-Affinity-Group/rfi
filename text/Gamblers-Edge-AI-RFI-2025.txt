To whom it may concern,
   LLMs (Large Language Models)/ “AI” is - in practice - 90-odd-percent *Snake Oil*; it frequently relies on slave
labor to spot things the “AI” misses, it is a profound waste of energy, has a gigantic carbon footprint; it is massively
unpopular in *Every* creative field and beyond; it is partly responsible for the chip shortage; has only*exacerbated* the problem with mineral extraction, and the associated slave labor/human rights abuses. On top ofall of that there is a *finite ceiling* on what it can learn, and we are *rapidly* approaching that ceiling. This is tosay *nothing* of the privacy concerns, RE: data brokers, non-consensual pornography (Deepfakes, etc…), bots,creating simulacra of deceased persons for *all manner* of nefarious purposes (which has already happened at leastonce: look up Utah/Anne Frank). It enables and encourages human laziness and intellectual atrophy in the*WORST* way; it is gatekept based on inherited wealth… The list is as *extensive* as it is *ghoulish*. I haven’teven mentioned the fact that legislation - *historically* - tends to lag behind technology, which creates a *plethora*of opportunities for bad actors. Knowledge is power, so look to Actual Experts for help in this matter: it affects Allof Us.Sincerely,
A Concerned Citizen
