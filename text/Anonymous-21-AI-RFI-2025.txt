AI is just software. It can be used for good or bad. I have seen AI that is programmed to lie. The 
guys who write the answers are obviously biased. So My comment is please see if we can base it 
on honesty 100%. Personally I dont like the automatic helping assistant BS. While sales are 
driven by this I do not want it on any software unless I ask for it. Thank you. When I see it used 
for good things, like DOGE, I will become more impressed.
