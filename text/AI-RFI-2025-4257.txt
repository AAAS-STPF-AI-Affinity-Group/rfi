General Comment
While current AI usage and innovation is in m y opinion inadequate com pared to what resources it consum es and uses to actually have
som ething close to functionality for everyday usage. It very m uch needs to be kept with som e restriction to what it is allowed and not
allowed to access and use as its base for learning. Infringing on copywrite of both corporate and induvial assets and intellectual ownership
in any aspect; be it arts, literature, or other such areas of possibility that it would draw from  in unacceptable. This would open the ability
for AI to sim ply run unchecked and unrestrained with no liability or way to hold it at fault for anything it does. Allowing quite sim ply,
crim inal activity or theft, m isinform ation and deceit to occur on a scale we have yet to see and encouraged to do so when no oversight is
set in place.
