General Comment
Allowing free-reign on data collection for "AI" com panies would effectively kill Am erican creative industries, affecting over 5 m illion hobs
and over a trillion dollars of the econom y.
Nonwithstanding that current "AI" technology is m ore or less nebulous as to its actual capabilities and that is com pletely unproven as to if it
is actually useful other than in very sm all niche applications and that it is m athem atically proven to not be scalable to hum an-level output (cf
Iris van Rooij et. al., "Reclaim ing AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science", 2025).
Stop buttering m oney into a technology that doesn't work, will not bring econom ic benefits and will ruin a trillion dollar industry.
Put m oney into real science, not fake m arketing claim s.
