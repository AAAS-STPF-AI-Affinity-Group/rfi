General Comment
I am  not glad to see that the governm ent is wanting to use copyright m aterial to train Artifical Intelligence which infringes on the publishers
and authors of this country that Pay the patent office for their work to be protected under current law.
If this goes into affect what would the incentives for people to copyright their works? What does it benefit if AI is there to learn from  it and
spit out a version that is garbage? Why would anyone buy it? What incentives does the consum er have to go with this product over
tradition? 
The im agined profits you visualize are short term  and will not last m ore than three years at best. The average Am erican and the world do
not agree with your approach of poaching m aterial from  publishers and it's creators and currently it is theft. 
I'm  happy to see that this adm inistration wants no one to have to pay for another tradem ark or copyright again which takes away revenue
from  the federal governm ent which is a way President Trum p prom ised to find. 
I am  happy to see that this adm inistration believes in pro censorship of the Am erican people now when before everyone was saying that it
was the previous adm inistration that did that. 
Good to see that the building of this infrastructure is what our tax dollars are paying for instead of where it needs to go such as tonight
education or safety or the boarder. 
These EO will not benefit the Am erican people at all.
