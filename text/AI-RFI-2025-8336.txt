General Comment
AI m ay be a part of out future but we should not run head long into its developm ent without properly considering the consequences of
unrestricted use of AI. Even in the short am ount of tim e that AI had been avaliable we have already beem  able to see what kind of
dam age it can cause. 
If we m ust decelope AI to secure a safe future we m ust ensure that it is done properly and those who use it for ill purposes are properly
punished. We also need to ensure that hum ans are at the forefront of creation and not allow AI to replace one of the few true expressions
of the hum an experience. Since AI does not create and sim ply im itates all artist who's work is used in AI should be properly com pensated
and be allowed to opt out of their work being used. If AI can not survive without Artist consent then AI should not survive at all. 
Please seriously consider the harm  that can be caused if careful regulations are not out in place to protect everyone from  the harm  that AI
can cause. Do not allow the thought of large profit gains to hide the real hum an harm  and suffering caused by its m isuse.
