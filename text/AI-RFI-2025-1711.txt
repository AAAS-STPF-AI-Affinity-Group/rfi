General Comment
Ai innovation can not com e at the expense of copyright. This will m ake us no better than china in their intellectual property theft. This if
anything will also hurt investors seeking production in the US due to there being no safeguarding properties. AI training will dem olish any
creative industry but also create a system  of errors that can not be corrected once trained incorrectly. This will vastly harm  the econom y in
ways that will be unknown until it happens. These laws are im portant. We can not disregard the law for the sake of one com pany. If this
were to be ignored then there would be no protections for any creative work put to paper.
