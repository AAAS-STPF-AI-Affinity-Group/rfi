AI is th eft. Gen AI is built on the concept of theft. Gen AI is not a legitimate artform or a useful 
tool. It is theft. The copyrights of artists of all kinds needs to be upheld. It should be up to us 
whether something has the right to use our work. If we take the time to create pieces, then we deserve to have the right to say someone can't use those pieces to make stolen works. This is not revolutionary. This isn't like the industrial revolution, where factories changed how labor was performed, it is quite literally profit off of theft. Gen AI can't exist without unrelated labor. It 
doesn't change how art is made, because if there aren't real artists creating art, Gen AI has nothing to steal from. Generative AI will never be legitimate. OpenAI, Midjourney, and other Gen AI applications take advantage of an entire working class of people just because of jealousy. They believe they have the God-given right to steal from artists, then cry when a developer in China creates a better Gen AI than them, claiming it is theft. They cannot have their cake and eat it, too.
