Cannot stress enough the need for a true open source AI so dedicated teams can help guide 
accura te data and algorithm use for training the AI and overcome the clear bias found in massive 
MSM and social media material not to mention the real risk of manipulated outcomes made to look accurate but are intentionally false and/or fabricated. This will also help ensure privacy concerns are managed in a healthy way Also need some safety measures and/or ability to unplug or otherwise turn off an AI that goes rogue and becomes a threat to persons, our country and humanity
