General Comment
Making such exceptions as prescribed by this and sim ilar policies for generative AI technologies, knowing full well that AI is not even
profitable bar cutting skilled workers/artists from  fields that have historically relied on creative and intellectual work, is a direct violation of
personal and intellectual property by allowing private com panies to steal the work of countless others to create their m achine learning
system s. At m inim um , this policy com pletely spits in the face of the Am erican copyright system . They cannot coexist. Do not accept this
policy.
