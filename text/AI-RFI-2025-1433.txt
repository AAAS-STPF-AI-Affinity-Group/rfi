Attn: Faisal D'Souza, NCO   
2415 Eisenhower Avenue   
Alexandria, V A 22314, USA   
RE: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
Dear Mr. D'Souza: 
We appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the development of the AI Action Plan aimed at 
sustaining and enhancing America's AI dominance. This response recom mends the adoption of the Data 
Foundation's "AI-Ready Data Policy" framework, created in collaboration with our Data Coalition 
members, or a similar approach, as a critical component of the Plan to ensure the United States maintains 
its global leadership in AI innovation. 
At the core of America's AI leadership is the quality, accessibility, and responsible governance of the data 
that powers AI systems. The Data Foundation's "Data Policy in the Age of AI: A Guide to Using Data for 
Artificial Intelligence"1 report, published in August 2024, provides a practical, balanc ed approach to data 
management that maximizes innovation potential while ensuring data quality and integrity. This 
comprehensive report, developed by a team of data policy experts, identifies the essential components of 
sound data policy in the age of AI and presents a practical tool for policymakers to assess data readiness 
for AI applications. This framework would enable the federal government to: 
1.Enhance American innovation by ensuring AI systems have access to high-quality, reliable data
2.Streamline access to government data assets for AI development
3.Establish clear standards for data governance without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens
4.Strengthen America's competitive position by improving the foundational data infrastructure upon
which AI systems rely
The Importance of Data Policy for AI Innovation 
As articulated in the Data Foundation's August 2024 report "Data Policy in the Age of AI: A Guide to 
Using Data for Artificial Intelligence," data is the driving force behind the AI revolution. This landm ark 
report represents a significant contribution to the national conversation on AI governance, offering 
policymakers a framework specifically designed to address the complex challenges at the intersection of 
data policy and AI development.

Artificial Intelligence. Washington, D.C.: Data Foundation. https://doi.org/10.15868/socialsector.44213 


 
The report emphasizes that "at the core of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is data. Data are used 
to train machine learning models and shape the outputs of AI systems in ways that directly impact human 
lives and business models." It further explains that "to build safe and effective AI systems, the data that 
contribute to AI models must be high-quality and governed responsibly." 
 
The quality, reliability, and availability of data directly impact the performance and capabilities of AI 
systems. Without a coordinated approach to data policy, American AI development risks being hindered 
by unreliable data sources, inconsistent governance practices, and inefficient access protocols. 
 
Effective, coordinated data policy is essential for AI systems to function as intended and deliver reliable 
results. By implementing the comprehensive data policy framework outlined in the Data Foundation's 
report, the federal government can help ensure that American AI developers have appropriate access to 
the highest quality data possible, thereby supporting continued innovation and maintaining U.S. 
technological leadership. 
 
The AI-Ready Data Policy Framework 
The Data Foundation's report introduces the AI-Ready Data Policy Tool, a structured approach designed 
to guide policymakers' considerations related to data for AI. As the report states, this tool is intended to 
"orient policymakers' considerations related to data for AI, guiding the parameters for if, how, and what 
data should contribute to AI models." The framework categorizes essential elements for responsible AI 
data use into three key components: 
 1. High Quality Data 
This component focuses on ensuring data integrity through: 
● Processes to monitor and improve data accuracy and completeness 
● Standards for identifying and addressing gaps in data 
● Integration of diverse, representative data to improve AI performance 
● Mechanisms to verify that data used in AI systems reflect real data points 
 
High-quality data is fundamental to developing effective AI systems. By implementing this 
component, the government can help ensure that AI developers have access to reliable, accurate 
data that will lead to better AI outcomes and greater innovation. 
 2. Effective Governance Principles 
This component addresses data transparency and accountability through: 
● Clear documentation of data used to train AI models 
● Appropriate metadata to provide necessary context 
● Oversight mechanisms for monitoring data policies and practices 
● Evaluation metrics for assessing data use effectiveness 
 
Effective governance enhances innovation by establishing clear rules of the road, reducing 
uncertainty for developers, and creating a stable environment for AI investment and development. 
 
3. Technical Capacity 


This component focuses on infrastructure security and innovation through: 
●Strong data security measures to protect AI development data
●Regular updates to data security practices
●Contingency plans for data infrastructure disruptions
●Leveraging government purchasing power to influence AI model development
●Standards for procurement of AI tools and services
Building robust technical capacity ensures that American AI developers have the infrastructure 
and resources necessary to maintain our technological edge over competitors like China. 
Benefits of Implementing the AI-Ready Data Policy Framework 
Adopting this framework as part of the AI Action Plan would yield several benefits that align with the 
goal of sustaining American AI dominance: 
Accelerating Innovation 
By providing clear guidance on data governance without imposing unnecessary restrictions, the 
framework can help American companies innovate more rapidly. Clear standards and processes reduce 
uncertainty and legal risks, allowing businesses to focus on development rather than compliance concerns. 
Enhancing Data Quality and Reliability 
The framework can help ensure that AI systems are trained on high-quality , reliable data, leading to more 
accurate and trustworthy AI applications. This would accelerate adoption of AI technologies across 
various sectors of the economy, further strengthening America's competitive position. 
Creating a Competitive Advantage 
By taking a leadership role in this area, the United States can set standards that align with American 
values and interests, rather than allowing competitors like China to define global norms. 
Enabling Responsible Data Sharing with Appropriate Protections 
The framework's incorporation of sophisticated approaches to data protection, such as the Five Safes 
model, enables more innovative data sharing while maintaining appropriate safeguards. This balanced 
approach allows for maximizing the utility of data for AI development without compromising on security 
or confidentiality. Rather than defaulting to overly restrictive data policies that stifle innovation, this 
nuanced approach enables data to be shared under appropriate conditions with proper controls, unlocking 
more potential for American innovation. 
Recommended Implementation Approach 
Building on the Data Foundation's research and recommendations, we propose the following 
implementation approach that aligns with these findings: 
●Leverage Existing Infrastructure: Rather than creating entirely new systems, the government
should focus on improving and standardizing federal agencies' use of existing technologies and
databases. This approach maximizes existing investments while enabling more innovative uses of
data for AI.


●Align with the Federal Data Strategy: Leverage the Federal Data Strategy Framework:
Incorporate the principles and practices established in OMB Memorandum M-19-182 as
foundational elements of the AI Action Plan. This established framework provides a
comprehensive structure for ensuring federal data is treated as a strategic asset while maintaining
appropriate protections. The Strategy's emphasis on ethical governance, conscious design, and
learning culture aligns perfectly with the data requirements for responsible AI development.●Clarify Roles and Responsibilities: Provide clear guidance on federal data officials'
responsibilities and roles, particularly as they relate to AI readiness.3 This clarity is essential for
effective implementation of any data policy framework and will ensure accountability.
●Strengthen Data Governance: Implement effective governance principles that ensure
mechanisms for transparency and public accountability. Clear governance practices will enable
AI tools and systems to be developed securely and responsibly while upholding public interests.
●Build Technical Capacity: Invest in workforce development initiatives to ensure federal
employees have the necessary skills to manage AI-ready data systems. The effectiveness of AI
tools depends on the literacy and technical expertise of those working with them.
●Coordinate Across Agencies: Break down data silos by facilitating easier discovery and access
to relevant datasets across government. Comprehensive data inventories and strong Chief Data
Officer roles will enable agencies to share and leverage data more effectively for AI applications.
●Implement "Open by Default" Principles: Follow the January 2025 White House Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on implementing the OPEN Government Data Act,4
which establishes that federal data should be maintained in open, machine-readable formats and
made publicly available unless specific privacy, security, or other legitimate concerns prevent
such sharing. This balanced approach would provide AI developers with broader access to
valuable training data while still maintaining necessary protections.●Adopt the Five Safes Framework for Data Protection:5 Implement a sophisticated model for
evaluating and managing privacy risks based on the Five Safes framework highlighted in the Data
Foundation's research. This multi-dimensional approach enables responsible data sharing by
considering: the people accessing the data (safe people), the projects or purposes for which data is
used (safe projects), the settings or environments in which data is accessed (safe settings), the
data itself (safe data), and the outputs produced from the data (safe outputs). This framework
allows for calibrating controls like vetting authorized users, pre-specifying approved use cases,
implementing secure technical environments, applying statistical techniques to protect individual
privacy, and reviewing outputs for potential privacy breaches.

Conclusion 
The AI-Ready Data Policy framework represents a balanced approach to data governance that would 
support American innovation while ensuring the integrity and quality of data used in AI systems. By 
incorporating this framework into the AI Action Plan, the Administration would address a fundamental 
aspect of AI development that is often overlooked: the quality and governance of the data upon which AI 
systems depend. 
This approach would help ensure that American AI development continues to lead the world by providing 
developers with access to high-quality, well-governed data while avoiding unnecessary regulatory 
burdens that could hamper innovation. 
Thank you for considering this recommendation. We would be pleased to provide additional information
