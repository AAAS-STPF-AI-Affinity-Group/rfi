General Comment
The copyright office m ust affirm  that training AI m odels on copyrighted content is NOT fair use.
Is this an undue burden on the developm ent of AI technology? No. The future of the overall inform ation econom y depends on the creators
of content being able to profit from  their creations. Without hum an input to train m odels and provide grounding in fact the developm ent of
AI technology will stagnate. All existing data has already been trained on. Strong copyright protections are needed to ensure that there is
an incentive to create new data.
