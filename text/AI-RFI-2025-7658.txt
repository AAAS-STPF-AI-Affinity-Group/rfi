General Comment
AI does not produce anything of value in the creative space. Please leave AI to autocorrect and pattern finding. Using it for the arts hurts
everybody. Anybody telling you it writes great scripts for m ovies is a liar trying to push faulty product by denying reality. AI as a creative
tool is genuine theft from  real artists and thereâ€™s no other way to spin that fact.
