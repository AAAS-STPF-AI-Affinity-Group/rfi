General Comment
I am  just a sm all fish in a big tech farm  and wanted to com m ent on the recent use of AI. Before Google released its helpful content update
and spam  update that seem  aim ed at destroying independents sites while prom oting big brands pushing AI scraped content, there was a
econom y for people to survive if they wanted to go in business. Since then countless of sm all local businesses were dem olished and
replaced with a sm all num ber of nationwide brands and they get their content scraped from  other. None of the people have any expertise
in what they do except finding a way to becom e a m iddle m an due to Google search team  ruthless vision of prom oting AI content to new
levels. Writing this is a sm all business, if big tech firm s like google going to destroy people's business, cut jobs and ruin a econom y, there
should be a penalty. This is the opposite of national security and a crazy com eback to theft.
