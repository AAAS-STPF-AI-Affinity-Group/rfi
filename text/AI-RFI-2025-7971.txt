General Comment
AI is theft, and worse, it’s theft of art, labor, and hard work. A colonizing of resources that others have earned—haven’t we been down
this road enough yet? How long m ust we continue this brutal curse? We pay for it, always, one way or another. AI does not deserve a
place in the United States workforce or econom y.
