How can you claim to promote “human flourishing” when the very foundation of AI generation 
is exploiting humans—namely artists, writers, and other creators? AI models are trained on 
stolen work, taking work from creatives without their express permission. The developers of these AI generators want to profit off the labor and expertise of artists in order to make a quick buck for an inferior product. Those “burdensome requirements” are necessary in order to keep the power and profit in the correct people’s pockets —the people who are actually creating the 
work, not these thieves parading as developers. If anything, there needs to be more regulations for AI. Requirements that every piece that is used to train the AI models has been sourced ethically with expres s, written consent from its original creator. In an online climate that is 
already rife with misinformation and willful ignorance of facts and science, creating more dubious AI generated writings and images will only lead us further into chaos. Our education numbers are laughable on a global level (and will continue to worsen if the abolishment of the Department of Education comes to fruition); leaning into this faulty, biased, and immorally created AI will only tank our statistics entirely. This is just on e of many short-sighted, profit-
driven, and misguided missteps that this administration has taken. Proving again and again that this administration is prioritizing profits over its own people.
