General Comment
AI in the hands of people who are only looking to m ake a profit will be harm ful to the public. This will only pave the way for fewer jobs
and a far m ore unstable econom y under the guise that "em ploying" AI will be cheaper. We need to have m ore developm ent opportunities
for real people that have real skills!
