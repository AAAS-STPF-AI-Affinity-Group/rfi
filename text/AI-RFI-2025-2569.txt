General Comment
AI is a dead end. We should not relax US Copyright law the way that AI com panies want us to. Congress has exercised their powers in
determ ining the length of tim e that a creator has exclusive rights to their work and generative AI in particular underm ines this. I do not
recom m end any changes to support the AI industry.
