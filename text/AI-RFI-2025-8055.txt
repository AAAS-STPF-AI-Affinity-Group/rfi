General Comment
I do not believe that allowing this plan to pass is even rem otely a good idea. As m uch as it has been prom ised to "be the future," it has
done nothing but spit out soulless am algam ations of all the art it's stolen, and give the wrong answer tim e and tim e again on the front page
of the biggest browser in the world. Allowing AI to run ram pant without consequence will only m ake these concerns and downsides m ore
prevalent around the globe, it will strip artists of their rights while placing heavy restrictions on what the public is allowed to see. If AI is
not held under extrem e scrutiny for the m assive copyright infringem ent it provokes daily, the world as we know it will fall into dystopia.
Do not allow AI to develop any further than it has. It is a tum or on the internet growing rapidly out of control, and if it's not rem oved soon,
it will have catastrophic consequences on the world, on the planet, on history, and for the rights of everyone.
