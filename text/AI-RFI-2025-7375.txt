General Comment
Do not pass this. Do not let this through. AI infringes on the creative copyrights of artists and writers. Since we the public can get punished
for copyright infringem ent, open AI m ust too. 
AI is built on stolen data, stolen art, stolen stories. It does not have the rights to those works. I was never asked consent to allow Ai to
learn from  m y data. 
AI is built on a stolen foundation, is too intrusive, widely loathed, and needs to die.
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE FOR ONCE AND DO THE RIGHT THING. WE DO NOT WANT AI SURVEILLANCE. WE DON'T
WANT OUR CREATIVE WORKS AND DATA STOLEN. WE HATE AI.
