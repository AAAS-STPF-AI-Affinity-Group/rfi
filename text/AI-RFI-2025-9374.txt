General Comment
The current m arketing of Artificial Intelligence is that it will be a wholecloth replacem ent for white collar labor. If Artificial Intelligence is to
be trained on copyrighted works and m aterials, the owners of the used copyrighted works and m aterials should be owed royalties for said
use in a com m ercial or industrial product. Artificial Intelligence Algorithm s are productsâ€”not people. Suddenly rendering significant
proportions of Am erican jobs redundant (and thus unem ployed), with no suitable replacem ent will do little to m ake Am erica m ore secure,
it will only serve to hurt the econom y at the ground level and destabilize our country. The push for Artificial Intelligence is, in part, driven to
elim inate jobs and concentrate wealth in the hands of a sm all few that will never spend it, effectively siphoning it out of the Am erican
econom y entirely.
It should also be stressed that the social contract of our country, Am erica, involves the exchange of labor in return for com fortable living.
The People, whom  provide this labor, are hum an beings, who will not disappear in a puff of sm oke if they are rendered unable to provide
said labor. In sim ple term s, they m ay be forced into poverty, or worse.
