General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to com m it m ass scale theft and plagiarism  would be a colossal m istake. There will be no benefit to Am ericans in
letting AI com panies ignore copyright law to train their system s that have extrem ely lim ited, niche use cases. This would, however, be a
m assive detrim ent to both the artists and creators AI com panies steal from  and to the public that will be force fed the terribly regurgitated
slop that LLMs pum p out.
