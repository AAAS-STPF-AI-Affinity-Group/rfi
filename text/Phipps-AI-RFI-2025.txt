While AI technologies certainly have great potential, the blatant violation of copyright law by AI 
tech companies must be cracked down on and the rights to one's own work protected. Stealing 
anyone's work in any context is wrong, even in the pursuit of maintaining 'dominance' in the field of AI. There are countless better and ethical ways that AI tech can be used and developed without infringing on the rights of writers, artists, musicians, content creators, and copyright holders. There are copyright free resources out there, many used by artists and content creators themselves, that could be used to train AI datamodels without theft or exploitation, and the companies that research and develop said tech can easily reach out to request usage of certain copyri ghted material from the rightful copyright holders for AI development. Anyone claiming 
that upholding copyright law and the rights of creators somehow impedes on the development of AI tech is woefully misinformed at best or actively cruel and spiteful towa rds creators and the 
hard work they put in at worst. Please, uphold copyright law and hold AI companies accountable. It will help everyone, including openai and other ai tech companies in the long run. Regulation is not the devil, it is the ground we stand on and orient ourselves by.
