General Comment
AI needs m ore restrictions, not less, in order to prevent potential harm  that can and will com e from  it continuing unchecked. Continuing to
let AI run ram pant would not only bring forth m any consequences for people in creative fields, but will also give AI m ore ability to learn
off of real people- m aking it all the m ore easy to create things like "deep-fakes" and other content that could incrim inate real life people,
including people of interest. Copyright law also exists for a reason and loosening the consequences for AI infringing on copyrights will also
set a precedent that non-AI entities should be able to do the sam e as well.
