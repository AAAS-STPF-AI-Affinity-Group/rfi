General Comment
Generative AI does nothing but regurgitate existing work, data, and inform ation into a slurry that clogs our culture and dam ages our natural
resources. Look at the studies showing how m uch less accurate Google has gotten since im plem enting its current AI features, and it
becom es clear that this technology is a net negative even without its disastrous side effects. The actual work being done by our
researchers, scientists, writers, and artists m ust be protected from  this technology that does nothing but turn into quarterly earnings for the
super-rich while destroying the environm ent and contributing to the m isinform ation of the public.
