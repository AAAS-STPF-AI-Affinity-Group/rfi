General Comment
Protections for copyright holders absolutely *m ust* be included in an AI action plan. As au author, having m y work fed to AI harm s m y
copyright and m y profits. The way m ost AI is trained is, at bottom , though stealing research and creative work from  its rightful owners and
feeding it into a m achine, without any consent by the people whose work is being used. Writers, researchers, and artists *m ust* be asked
for consent and com pensated before their work is used to train AI. AI com panies should not be able to circum vent issues of copyright, for
if they do, underm ines' others ability to m ake a living from  work that they have spent years, som etim es decades, creating. For that m atter,
*publishing com panies* feeding their authors' works into AI without notice to, consent of, and paym ent to their authors is flagrantly
unethical. I urge the federal governm ent to protect the work of authors and researchers by creating clear and rigorous rules and guidelines
that adhere to current copyright law and require notice and paym ent for using som eone's work to train AI.
