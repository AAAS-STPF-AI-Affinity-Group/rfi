General Comment
Generative AI desperately needs to be lim ited. For the stopping of m isinform ation, circum venting of copyright law and ethics in the new
age of technology, we have to be the first ones to protect real hum an beings, both poor artists, and rich politicians are at risk here, not to
m ention the m ajority of the population that will not be able to discern the real from  the fake. It will end up being regulated in the future, we
m ight as well get a head start.
