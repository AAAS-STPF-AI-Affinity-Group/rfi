General Comment
When Ai uses other peopleâ€™s work they not only devalue the work of hard working Am ericans, it will cause job loss, less m oney going
into the econom y, and harm  to m illions of Am ericans.
This country was form ed based on the idea that people should be free to have their own property and career. Do not allow this to pass.
