General Comment
This law would bring about the end of copyright, thus anyone's ability to properly safeguard their IP's, art, and businesses.
By allowing this law to pass, this would bring about the worst aspects of China to the US. This is how you play with Com m unism . 
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
Do not allow this to go through. There is no turning back from  this and we will never be able to recover as a country.
