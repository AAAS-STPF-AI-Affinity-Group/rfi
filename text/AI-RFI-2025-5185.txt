General Comment
Artists are the heart and soul of our country. Allowing big tech to steal from  artists without repercussion is a potential death knell to the
creativity of our nation. The livelihood of artists, writers, m usicians, and m ore are at stake because of AI actively stealing from  us and big
tech trying to destroy our jobs. As a working AMERICAN ARTIST, speaking up for all artists in this country, I say NO to this proposal!
