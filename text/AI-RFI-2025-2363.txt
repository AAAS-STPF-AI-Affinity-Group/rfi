General Comment
Leave m y data and creations alone. If the USA wants to continue to have a creative m arket of any kind (arts, m usic, writing, gam es, etc.
etc.) we cannot allow com panies free access to use the things people create. They are stealing our work. And they don't want to face the
consequences for stealing. Don't let them  get away with this.
