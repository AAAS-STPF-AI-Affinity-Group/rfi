General Comment
There is no valid case use for generative AI. The entire point of generative AI is to put writers, artists, editors, etc out of work. The results
produced by generative AI are inaccurate to the point of legal liability. Even the suggestion that generative AI could be used in m edical
fields is dangerous as these platform s are essentially predictive text - the output is not trustworthy, and often produce dam aging results. 
These platform s are also trained on copyrighted works, which is grounds for further legal conundrum s as they are m ore widely used.
Direct excerpts of published copyrighted works have been found in exam ples produced by OpenAI. These platform s create nothing. 
It is, by all m easures, plagiarism . 
There is no purpose in having this tech race with China over generative AI. It is a pointless endeavor where too m uch m oney and tim e is
being spent. Again, no one has been able to produce a valid case use for generative AI in any capacity. 
If anything, these platform s should be found as illegal and shut down from  this point forward. Intellectual property holders should be able
to file suit against com panies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, X, etc for the utilization of their creative works in “training” these AI platform s. 
This should never have gone as far as it already has.
