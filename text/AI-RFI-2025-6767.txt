General Comment
OpenAI does not need the ability to legally steal inform ation to feed into the AI. OpenAI should not be im m une from  copyright
infringem ent. This is not a m atter of national security. AI does not hold a place in the future of the United States; especially if its future is
based on stealing creativity and work from  hum an beings. AI is already stealing the livelihood from  Am ericans. It profits from  theft. AI
needs m ore regulation, not less regulation and it certainly does not need to steal copyrighted content to use for training.
