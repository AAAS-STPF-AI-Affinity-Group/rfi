I am fully AGAINST protecting AI companies/platforms from copyright infringement.
This will stifle American ingenuity and creativity. This will open the door for rampant copyright infringement, to  
the point of rendering US copyright law obsolete.
Again, I am AGAINST any kind of copyright protections for AI companies.
