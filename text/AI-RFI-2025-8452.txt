General Comment
I am  against this proposed rule. If "AI" needs to have unfettered access to stolen intellectual property in order to rem ain "com petietive,"
then its business m odel is broken and should be com pletely dism antled. Algorithm s don't "create" anything, but use fancy m ath to build
probabilities of words and im ages. This is not how hum ans create. And real artists and writers are being pushed to the econom ic fringes
without these false technologies invading their space with the prom ises of billionaires and false AI m essiahs. Artists and writers need to be
protected from  com panies stealing their work. Not the other way around.
