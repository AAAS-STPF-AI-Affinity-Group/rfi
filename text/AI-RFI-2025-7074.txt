General Comment
AI com panies are scam m ers and the m oney that's been shoveled into these com panies is an attem pt to create a non-hum an worker who
won't need rights and can be exploited without lim it. These AI com panies can only exist by stealing other people's words, thoughts,
expressions, and creative output. They have nothing to offer and should be beholden to the sam e copyrite law that prevents theft of all
types of work. To give a legal cover to these AI com panies that are stealing other people's work is abom ination.
