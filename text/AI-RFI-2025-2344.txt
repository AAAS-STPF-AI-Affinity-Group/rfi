General Comment
Artificial intelligence (AI) m odels should not be allowed to train on copyrighted m aterial. Regulations should be put into place to prevent
unfair use of copyrighted m aterial through AI m odel training. Additionally, regulations on the use of generative AI to produce
content/m edia in the likeness of a real person should be put in place.
On all platform s, the use of AI should be transparent and AI-generated im ages or content should be clearly m arked as such. This is
especially im portant in educational settings, where students and children can be exposed to m isinform ation. Platform s should also have a
built-in option to opt out of seeing AI-generated content.
As the use of AI, and particularly generative AI, consum es a large am ount of energy, m ore environm ent-friendly alternatives should also
be investigated.
