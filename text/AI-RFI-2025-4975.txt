General Comment
Generative AI, artificial intelligence that can only create things when other people's work is stolen and fed into it, is one of the worst things
to happen this generation. People's intellectual properties, to say nothing of the work they put into their art, need to be protected from  this.
We should NOT allow copyrighted m aterial to train AI.
