""AI""  is nothing more than a sham that spreads harmful disinformation at the cost of 
Everyone  on the planet. AI, NFTs, etc. will pull the rug out from normal citizens with no 
billions to line their pockets, all while siphoning off the creativity and hard work of writers, 
artists, and animators. Real people who make real work with their own hands. The world is 
burning for your hubris, and if you continue encouraging it all of the climate related deaths 
and refugees will be on your hands!! YES TO HUMAN ART, NO TO AI!! STOP KILLING THE PLANET!!!
