General Comment
To give OpenAI copyright im m unity is to overrule all previous copyright subm issions, claim s, lawsuits, patents, and intellectual property. It
is to give them  perm ission to steal from  artists, writers, film m akers, actors, inventors, publishers, and those who have learned to harness
their creativity for the greater good.
Just once in your life, forget trying to exploit the working class to m ake everything profitable and rem em ber som e piece of m edia that has
touched your soul and changed your life perspective. You want to autom ate your thoughts? Your feelings? No, I don't think you do. The
right thing to do is to ignore OpenAI's plea for copyright im m unity; in fact, to deny all such leech behavior and let your own hum anity
reign.
