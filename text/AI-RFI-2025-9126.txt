General Comment
Putting governm ent backing behind AI will create m assive security risks, allowing bad actors to scrape governm ent data, personal data,
and the work of both sm all creators and the biggest corporations in the country, all to claim  to create an intelligent m achine, that is actually
nothing m ore than an algorithm  pretending to be sm art. 
AI has already put m illions of Am ericans out of work, or drastically reduced their workhours and pay. DO NOT support the continued
theft of copyrighted inform ation and personal data!
