General Comment
I do not want AI used in any aspect of governm ent. It is unreliable, routinely giving ludicrously wrong answers. It is alm ost always based
of theft of copyrighted m aterial, which should never be allowed or excused. AI is being pushed down our throats by tech bros with zero
m orals or respect for rights.
