General Comment
If a com pany cannot properly do the due diligence of properly selecting which data they are allowed to use to train AI, I see no reason to
believe what they end up creating will be the best available. Allowing sloppiness in creation of AI, when it is being m ade by the
organizations with som e of the m ost resources in the country, and indeed the world is ridiculous. These countries should be working within
the existing structures that exist for every other Am erican.
They should not just be given shortcuts beyond what all others have when they have all these resources available.
