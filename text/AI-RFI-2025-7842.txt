General Comment
I am  an artist and gam e developer who has worked on m ultiple high profile entertainm ent franchises.
"AI" technologies like ChatGPT, Dall-E, and others are based on the nonconsensual theft of the work of m illions of creators across
dozens of industries and disciplines. In addition to the legal ram ifications of such actions, these AI technologies have repeatedly proven to
be dangerous, unreliable, and prone to spreading false inform ation. If being im m oral and illegal were not enough, these technologies are
not even profitable.
In conclusion, these technologies should not be encouraged, used, or subsidized by the governm ent in any way. 
I suggest these "AI" com panies be held responsible for obtaining the perm ission of every single creator for every single work they want to
incorporate into their databases. These com panies should be required to im m ediately rem ove all work for which they do not have such
perm ission from  their databases.
