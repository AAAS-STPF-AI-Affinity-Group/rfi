General Comment
I hereby request further inform ation on this plan.
Gen. AI and LLMs have created a terrible precedent for theft of intellectual property, m isinform ation, erosion of the arts, anti-
intellectualism , privacy violation and perhaps m ost of all, severe environm ental concerns stem m ing from  the sheer am ount of energy
needed to keep it all running.
Given these concerns, I am  extrem ely doubtful that these technologies are of any benefit to hum anity, as they are now. Please rem em ber
when developing an AI plan that AI should be used to do well what hum ans do badly, not badly what hum ans do well.
P.S., these technologies are effectively pro-fascism .
