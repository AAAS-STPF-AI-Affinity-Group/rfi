General Comment
The privacy and intellectual property rights of private citizens m ust be of utm ost im portance regarding AI policy. Already, we have seen
that AI com panies have little regard for copyright protections, harvesting m ass am ounts of copyrighted work (e.g. writing, artwork, etc)
from  the internet to develop their m odels without any perm ission from  the owners of said works, thus directly profiting off their work.
Additionally, m ass am ounts of personal data and inform ation are harvested by tech corporations to be sold off to advertisers or other 3rd
parties; for AI com panies to do the sam e would be a sim ilarly m assive breach of privacy for the Am erican public. Already we have seen
propositions to use AI to predict hum an behavior: who is best to let out of jail and who should stay, who should be deported for their
potential to com m it future crim es, who should be hired and who should be fired. Such uses are incredibly inappropriate to downright
dangerous: a com puter program  with zero accountability should not be trusted to m ake potentially life-altering decisions regarding our
lives.
President Trum pâ€™s executive order m akes it clear that this adm inistration prioritizes the profit of tech corporations above the safety and
security of the Am erican people. Rem oving safeguards to AI developm ent will not m ake us safer; it will only lead to increased surveillance
and give us less control over our own lives. I am  wholeheartedly opposed to the idea.
