General Comment
GenAi/Ai com panies only exist bc they have great m arketing departm ents. They call stealing other people’s work “Scraping” or
“learning”. They call the lies that their m odels com e up with as an answer “hallucinations”. The definition of taking som ething from
som eone without their perm ission/ consent, is stealing. This is what Ai/GenAi is doing when it’s steals artists work & it’s product directly
com petes with the artists they stole from  - they are putting people out of work. GenAi/Ai com panies stole TRILLIONS of dollars of work
& the artists see nothing, & m ore often than not, have lost their jobs. GenAi/Ai is also accelerating the breakdown of our planet - between
1-50 queries on ChatGPT is equivalent to pouring our an entire liter of water & enough power to power thousands of hom es — all those
resources wasted just to cool a super com puter. Grok requires 1,000,000 gallons of fresh water & enough electricity to power 100,000
hom es for A YEAR, just to cool its super com puter for 1 day. This is not sustainable. Putting people out of work & wasting our resources
- GenAi/Ai is not the future.
