General Comment
Please DO NOT allow this to happen.
AI is an outstandingly wasteful technology that has no place in our society.
Even if that were not the case, as a working artist I object in the strongest term s to the way it functions as both an engine of theft and also
a m achine that churns out em tpy, lowest-com m on-denom inator garbage.
It is a field for hucksters and vultures and we will gain nothing of value by allowing it to further swallow our econom y and energy grid.
