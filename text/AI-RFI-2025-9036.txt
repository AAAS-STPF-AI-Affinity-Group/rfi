General Comment
AI training should not be perm itted under copyright law without perm ission and com pensation by the creators. Libraries pay special
liscenses to distribute e-books- they cannot scan and freely distribute pdfs of books. Sim ilarly, AI is not being used for a single hum an's
consum ption but for infinite copies. This is not fair use of anyone's creative work.
