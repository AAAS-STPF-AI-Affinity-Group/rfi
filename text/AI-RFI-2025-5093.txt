General Comment
Allowing Artificial Intelligence to be trained on copyrighted m aterials without perm ission from  the m aterials' owner(s) is theft, it will further
weaken the US econom y, and it has no place in the US. Creative businesses that actually invest in their own work and people instead of
faking it with AI will suffer. Stealing other people's ideas and work in order to profit from  them  should not, m ust not becom e the Am erican
way.
