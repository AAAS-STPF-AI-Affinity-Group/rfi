General Comment
I do not support private AI com panies allowed use to use copyrighted works or private works of an individual to exploit for developm ent
of these private AI com panies.
AI com panies are overly loud about announcing their im portance to the US people and the governm ent while being ignorant about the
sheer soft-power the creative industries has for influencing the well-being of the United States and hum anity in general.
Hum ans need to be put first in priority for their health and success, not a lim ited few of AI-related people. 
To justify m y claim s, a sim ple question can be asked...
What do you think has m ore influence in the world? Art or War? 
The fact that art, such as Hollywood, video gam e industry, anim ated works, illustrations, and m uch m uch m ore can even be com pared to
warfare is an indicator of the sheer im portance of FREEDOM OF SPEECH brought to you by the individual voices seen through creative
works. 
Do not allow AI groups to shill you into thinking what we take for granted nowadays is less im portant than what AI groups are doing. AI
will be best used as a tool for these groups, but it is not. It is being used to replace and shift m ajority of creative hum ans into struggle. I
would im agine the am ount of singular propaganda will increase insanely while the voices of the public will be reduced through the
prom otion of AI developm ent.
