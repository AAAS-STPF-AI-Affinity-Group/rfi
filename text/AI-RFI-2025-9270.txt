General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to train m odels on intellectual property they do not own will wreak havoc on the econom y, and ruin the livelihoods
of countless creators. AI cannot replace hum an creativity, and the com panies who push the technology into the m arketplace are short-
sighted trading near-term  profit for long-term  devastation. Protect the rights and labor of hum ans.
