General Comment
My com m ent is that copyright law exists to ensure the rights and livelihoods of working people and their innovations are protected by law
from  theft. I strongly opposed giving AI com panies free rein to pillage the original works of Am ericans. The notion is flies in the face of
hum an dignity and actively degrades the citizenry. DO NOT ALLOW IT.
