I believe AI has an important place in the future, and America should be the leader in AI
technology, however there are currently outstanding serious ethical concerns on many frontsthat must be addressed, before a wide majority of the population will be willing to accept AIbeing used.
Currently, AI stands to threaten millions of jobs, as employers are entirely willing to replace
live workers with AI wherever
 possible, with no regard for the quality of the service provided
by said AI. Regulations need to be implemented here, ones that safeguard workers, and protectintellectual property per our current laws.
AI in the creative space is flagrantly violating US copyright laws, and accepting whatever slap
on the wrist might apply as they scrape and steal creative works across the internet without theconsent of the creators. This MUST be addressed before the US can become the leader
 in AI
technology.
