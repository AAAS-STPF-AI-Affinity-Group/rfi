General Comment
1. As Deepseek dem onstrated, anything US AI com panies can do, China can do cheaper. This m eans any data that US AI com panies
scrape will also be scraped by Chinese AI com panies. Chinese com panies will then win the pricing race to the bottom .
We need to be investing in ways to protect IP and copyright (like the Nightshade project), so the US can m aintain its edge in innovation
and creativity.
2. Classifying AI training as fair use is a m assive governm ent handout to big com panies who can afford to pay for their own data. It will
decim ate US design industries and stifle US creativity.
