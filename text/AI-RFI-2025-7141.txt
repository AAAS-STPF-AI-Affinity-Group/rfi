General Comment
AI is an incredibly fallible tool that has no place in anything as sensitive or high stakes as "national security." It's a speculative m arket that
has been hyped for years, but shown very little practical use aside from  m aking silly im ages. The only "security" I can im agine to be at
stake here is that of investor's wallets, as AI has been a huge m oney sink with no returns. Allowing them  open borders to seek new ways
to profit off of theft and plagiarism  is only in the interest of a few, not the Am erican public. The novelty is wearing off, and average
Am erican citizens are largely uninterested or distrustful of AI. It's a bubble that will eventually burst without m oney being funneled into it,
and AI has no place in the future of the United States.
