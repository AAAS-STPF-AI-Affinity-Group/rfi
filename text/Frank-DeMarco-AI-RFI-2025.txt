AI Committee,
From Frank DeMarco – individual
Prohibit all Federal/State/Local agencies/entities from using Chinese, or Chinese-related
software/hardware period.Any State/Local entities that do not comply shall loose Federal funding.
Any Chinese company, directly, or indirectly that have relationship(s) with the communistparty, or members, must be under the control of the USA.
While this suggestion may seem radical, note that all Chinese companies ultimately mustcomply with the communist party.
Knowing these facts,  shouldn’t we be compelled to protect our way of life against these
threats?
Thank you,Frank
