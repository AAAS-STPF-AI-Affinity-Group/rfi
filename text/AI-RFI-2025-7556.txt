General Comment
This m ove would be an aberration to the Am erican principle of private property ownership. Private property includes intellectual property
of creative works . If used by BIG TECH the owner should be rem unerated. If the creator, whether it be an individual or a corporation
owns the rights to the work is not com pensated for its use then it is akin to stealing. The governm ent m ust protect the value of private
property.
