General Comment
I believe the current course of action is reckless and erodes the protections of our nationâ€™s freedom  of speech, allowing the societally-
disconnected rich to freely claim  and profit off of the work of countless hard working Am ericans through the faceless actions of
corporations that they hide behind. 
To disallow the ability of our hardworking creative talent to be com pensated fairly through use of their creations underm ines the Am erican
dream  and heavily incentivizes any and everyone to create quickly m ade, low quality trash to be fed into the AI algorithm s for a quick,
too-low buck.
A high quality well-fed AI/LLM is likely to do better over a low quality overfed with fast-food AI/LLM.
