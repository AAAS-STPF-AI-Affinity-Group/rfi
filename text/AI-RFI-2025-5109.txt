General Comment
Why should Open AI corporations not be subjected to long-established copyright laws that protect artists, writers and creatives from
having their work stolen?
The reason is m oney, of course. These corporations want to take m oney from  the pockets of already struggling, hard working artists and
add it to their pile of senseless wealth.
This is unacceptable. There is no place for unfettered generative AI in civilised society. 
Open AI openly scorns hum an intelligence and talent and aim s to squash it in favour of regurgitated, nonsensical slop that consum es m ore
electricity than Saudi Arabia <https://news.m it.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environm ental-im pact-0117>
Open AI absolutely should be held accountable to copyright laws, as this is the very reason these laws were created. 
Allowing these technologies to consum e hum an artwork ceaselessly and without constraints would be a devastating blow to the Arts
industry.
