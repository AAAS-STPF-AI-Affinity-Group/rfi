General Comment
Copyright laws and patents all dictate that the inform ation used to train AI m odels by AI com panies m ust be attributed and com pensated
for. If president Trum p's plan includes upholding copyright and patent law and com pensating the authors of inform ation used to train AI, I
agree the US can be the forefront of the AI revolution. If not, president Trum p's AI plan needs to be scrapped. I am  a skilled, full tim e
senior software engineer in the AI security space; we cannot abandon our laws for profit.
