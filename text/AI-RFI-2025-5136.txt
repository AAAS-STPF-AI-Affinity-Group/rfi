General Comment
Generative AI is built on stolen works and can only exist by stealing. It is a scourge upon artists and scientists. Several trillion dollars were
wasted and every piece of art ever put on the Internet were stolen so that som e tech bros could m ake a calculator that only works 85% of
the tim e. It is a dead end technology that will take up m ore and m ore resources while providing no returns. Do not em power this
disgusting industry. We will all suffer for it.
