General Comment
Generative AI is theft and “produces” work of little to no value, is often incorrect, and wastes m assive am ounts of natural resources to run
its servers. 
It is em barrassing that the US seeks to advance its “AI dom inance,” which am ounts to bragging about its own laziness and inability to
think critically. 
We should not take the copyrighted work of actual hum ans and feed it to a m achine/program  for worse outputs when protecting the
intellectual property and livelihood of those hum ans is the actual role of governm ent. There is so little to be gained by going all-in on AI,
and so m uch to lose.
