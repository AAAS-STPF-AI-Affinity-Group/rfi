General Comment
It's a dead end technology at the end of its hype cycle. Com panies and investors are throwing m oney at this tool hoping to stum ble onto a
way to m ake m oney; none have succeeded so far and new m odels show that building bigger m odels yields fewer and fewer returns. Itâ€™s
not worth investing in as a country.
