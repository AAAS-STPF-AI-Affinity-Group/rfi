General Comment
Open AI only exists because it steals the creative work of hum ans and then pum ps out a worse less coherent version of it all while burning
through m ore energy than we can spare. Every science fiction classic warns about losing our shared hum anity to technology. Why should
AI be allowed to exist when it has been proven to be m assively harm ful to our planet and our com m unities?
