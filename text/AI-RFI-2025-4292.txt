General Comment
Giving OpenAI im m unity to any copyright lawsuit will open the floodgates for copyright infringem ent for any other AI com pany looking to
m ake m oney by stealing the works of or pretending to be artists or com panies. It is, fundam entally, a threat towards the ability of
copyright holders to protect them selves and their IPs. Im agine how far this could go - if OpenAI gets a pass, then AI im age generators
could com e next, and a bootlegger could use the likeness of any character they wanted by sim ply generating im ages of them  with AI.
