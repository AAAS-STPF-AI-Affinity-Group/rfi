NSF RFI Response  – AI Governance  & Regulatory  Automation  | 02/16/2024  Page 1 of 5 Response to NSF RFI on AI Action Plan  
AI Governance, Regulatory Automation & Workforce Development  
To: National Science Foundation (NSF)  
From:  Sam Daniel Timothy, Founder & Principal Consultant, Sysfleet Consulting LLC  
Date:  February  16, 2025 
Submission Deadline:  March 15, 2025  
1.Introduction & Background
I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the National Science Foundation’s AI Action Plan  as 
part of Executive Order 14179 . As the Founder and Principal Consultant of Sysfleet Consulting 
LLC , I specialize in AI-powered regulatory automation, robotic process automation (RPA), and 
systems engineering . My work has focused on optimizing government workflows, integrating AI 
into regulatory decision -making, and ensuring AI solutions uphold transparency, accountability, 
and security . 
AI has enormous potential to streamline regulatory compliance, drive economic growth, and 
improve public service efficiency , but it must be implemented responsibly . It is imperative that 
AI remains an assistive tool rather than an authoritative force , ensuring that human oversight is 
embedded in all AI -driven decision -making processes.  
Given my experience in AI-driven regulatory compliance, automation, and workforce 
development , I offer recommendations in the following areas:  
1.AI in Regulatory Compliance & Governance
2.AI Workforce Development & Public -Private Collaboration
3.AI Ethics: Ensuring AI Does Not Override Human Rights


NSF RFI Response  – AI Governance  & Regulatory  Automation  | 02/16/2024  Page 2 of 5 2.AI in Regulatory Compliance & Governance
Challenge:  
The increasing complexity of regulations  across industries such as construction, finance, and 
healthcare  has led to significant inefficiencies. Compliance procedures often involve manual 
document verification, permit approvals, and interpretation of multi -jurisdictional laws , creating 
a bottleneck for businesses and government agencies.  
AI-driven regulatory automation has the potential to improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision -
making  in compliance processes. However, existing policies do not sufficiently support AI-
assisted regulatory decision systems  while ensuring they remain transparent, accountable, and 
unbiased . 
Recommendation:  
•Develop standardized AI -driven compliance frameworks  to enable businesses and
governments to automate permit approvals, documentation, and regulatory filings  while
ensuring accuracy, fairness, and transparency.
•Encourage AI -driven public -private partnerships  to build regulatory interpretation models
that dynamically analyze and apply federal, state, and local regulations  while preserving
human oversight.
•The U.S. should explore federal funding incentives  for AI -powered regulatory
automation, particularly in industries with heavy compliance burdens such as
construction, energy, and financial services .
•Ensure that AI does not replace human regulatory oversight  but serves as a decision -
support system  that enhances efficiency while preserving due process.
•Establish an independent AI regulatory review board  that evaluates AI -driven automation
tools to ensure they align with constitutional rights, legal standards, and ethical
considerations .
By integrating AI in regulatory compliance responsibly , the government can reduce bureaucratic 
inefficiencies, lower costs, and improve decision -making  while maintaining strong governance.  


NSF RFI Response  – AI Governance  & Regulatory  Automation  | 02/16/2024  Page 3 of 5 3.AI Workforce Development & Public -Private Collaboration
Challenge:  
The demand for AI expertise is growing rapidly , but the AI workforce gap  remains a major 
challenge. Many organizations struggle to find qualified AI professionals  who can develop, 
deploy, and maintain AI solutions effectively.  
Additionally, AI adoption in government and industry requires multidisciplinary talent , including 
expertise in ethics, policy, cybersecurity, and automation . Without structured workforce 
development programs , the U.S. risks falling behind in AI competitiveness  and failing to ensure 
AI implementation aligns with ethical and legal standards.  
Recommendation:  
•Expand federal AI training and upskilling programs  to develop a workforce capable of
handling AI -powered regulatory automation, AI ethics, and AI governance.
•Establish AI fellowships and grants  to support professionals and researchers working on
AI automation, regulatory tech, and AI policy development .
•Create collaborative AI research hubs  that bring together government, academia, and
private sector experts  to develop responsible AI models  that enhance efficiency while
ensuring fairness and transparency.
•Promote hands -on AI apprenticeships  where students and professionals can gain practical
experience  working on AI -driven public sector initiatives.
•Incorporate AI ethics, fairness, and human rights education  into AI and data science
degree programs, ensuring that future AI professionals develop responsible AI systems .
•Encourage companies to train AI specialists  in automation, regulatory AI, and
compliance -based AI systems , ensuring that industry solutions are safe, explainable, and
auditable .
By prioritizing AI workforce development , the U.S. can strengthen AI innovation, improve AI 
implementation in government, and ensure AI adoption does not create unintended biases or 
risks . 


NSF RFI Response  – AI Governance  & Regulatory  Automation  | 02/16/2024  Page 4 of 5 4.AI Ethics: Ensuring AI Does Not Override Human Rights
Challenge:  
As AI systems become more prevalent in government, employment, finance, and law 
enforcement , there is an increasing risk of biased decision -making, automated discrimination, 
and AI overriding fundamental human rights . Without strong safeguards, AI could restrict access 
to critical services, misinterpret legal frameworks, or infringe on privacy and civil liberties . 
For example, AI models used for automated hiring, credit risk assessment, law enforcement, and 
government decision -making  must be fair, explainable, and free from systemic biases . 
Additionally, individuals must have the right to appeal AI -driven decisions , ensuring that AI 
does not become a black box of unchecked authority . 
Recommendation:  
•Mandate human oversight in AI -driven decisions  affecting citizens' rights, including
employment, finance, legal judgments, and regulatory compliance .
•Develop federal AI governance standards  to prevent AI -driven discrimination, bias, and
unexplainable decisions  in critical sectors.
•Require government -used AI models to be auditable, transparent, and accountable ,
ensuring that all AI -driven decisions align with civil liberties and due process .
•Establish a federal AI ethics board  to evaluate and regulate AI deployments that impact
human rights, privacy, and accessibility .
•Introduce AI appeal mechanisms , ensuring that individuals can challenge automated
decisions and request human intervention  when necessary.
•Require public AI impact assessments  for AI systems used in government decision -
making, regulatory automation, and critical infrastructure  to ensure that AI aligns with
legal and ethical standards.
By embedding AI ethics into policy , the U.S. can ensure that AI enhances human capabilities 
rather than overriding fundamental rights . AI should function as a tool for decision support , not 
as an unchecked authority dictating outcomes in sensitive areas.  


NSF RFI Response  – AI Governance  & Regulatory  Automation  | 02/16/2024  Page 5 of 5 5.Conclusion
AI offers transformative potential in regulatory automation, workforce development, and 
governance , but it must be implemented responsibly . AI should assist human decision -making 
rather than replace it , ensuring fairness, transparency, and ethical compliance . 
By prioritizing:  
•AI-driven regulatory automation with human oversight ,
•Workforce development to bridge the AI skill gap , and
•Ethical AI governance to protect human rights ,
The U.S. can lead in AI innovation while safeguarding individual freedoms and ensuring AI 
adoption is both responsible and competitive . 
I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this discussion and look forward to collaborating 
further in shaping a transparent, ethical, and effective AI policy framework . 
Thank you for your consideration.

Outside of the technology being a m ess, we as a nation have a plethora of other places m oney like this could, and should, go to. Wasting

their teaching m ethods. Training program s should focus on:
• Helping teachers balance AI use with traditional learning m ethods.
• Encouraging faculty in higher education to integrate AI into research and coursework while m aintaining academ ic integrity.
• Providing clear guidelines on when and how AI tools should be used in assessm ents and assignm ents to avoid over-reliance.
4. Ethical AI Education and Awareness
With the rapid deploym ent of AI, it is critical that students at all levels understand AI ethics, including issues of privacy, bias, and
accountability. Policies should:
• Require AI ethics courses as part of both K-12 and higher education curricula.
• Teach students to recognize and m itigate biases in AI m odels, ensuring that AI developm ent is equitable and inclusive.
• Prom ote discussions on AI’s societal im pacts, particularly in fields such as healthcare, crim inal justice, and labor m arkets.
By taking these steps, the United States can ensure that AI is used to enhance learning and research without underm ining the intellectual
skills that drive true innovation. If the AI Action Plan focuses solely on advancing AI technology without equipping students with the
critical thinking skills needed to engage with it m eaningfully, we risk creating a workforce that depends on AI rather than one that leads it.
I strongly urge the adm inistration to prioritize AI education policies that em power students to harness AI as a tool for discovery,
innovation, and critical analysis. By ensuring that AI education is both widespread and intellectually rigorous, we can prepare the next
generation to lead in AI developm ent rather than m erely follow its advancem ents.
Thank you for considering m y perspective. I look forward to seeing policies that support both AI literacy and the cultivation of
independent thought across all levels of education with this adm inistration’s support.
Sincerely,
Raza Ali
