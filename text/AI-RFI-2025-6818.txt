General Comment
Gen AI doesn't just violate the ownership of individual artists over their unique works, it also opens up m any m ajor corporations for
copyright infringem ent. Rem oving guardrails from  Gen AI will result in the destruction of m any beloved Am erican icons and works.
Perm itting Gen AI will only lead to further cultural loss within the US and, in leading to fewer em ployed artists and creatives, ultim ately
dim inishing our previously robust entertainm ent exports.
