General Comment
"burdensom e requirem ents"?
Regulations for public safety, well being and protection of intellectual property are not "burdensom e".
Safeguards against a com pany scrapping any/all data produced and owned by other persons for profit are not "burdensom e".
The kind of open range landscape these com panies are pushing for will only m ean no reasonable person or com pany will feel safe to
create any digital content or have any digital/online presence. 
No regulations m eans the internet as we have known it will be gone.
