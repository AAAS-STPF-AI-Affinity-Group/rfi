General Comment
I am  writing as the author and editor of seven books, alm ost all of which were used without m y perm ission to train LLMs created by
OpenAI. It would be a betrayal of Am erican values, and of federal law, to give OpenAI im m unity from  future lawsuits. It would destroy
the value of creative endeavors and lead to a torrent of m isinform ation that could cause untold dam age â€” indeed, it already has, thanks to
the uptick in energy and water use, as well as the exorbitant costs, required for these LLMs to operate.
I urge you all to reconsider this. Thank you very m uch for your tim e and attention.
Very truly yours,
Sarah Weinm an
