I am  begging you to not let OpenAI use copyrights m aterial to train their AI, it is STEALING! AI has no place in the future of the U.S, I
think it is a m ajor threat! It steals jobs, it steals m aterial, it consum es so m uch energy, the idiots in the Governm ent want to im plem ent it to
control very sensitive sectors, if anything, AI should be outlawed and Open AI should be shut down or banned from  Governm ent affairs.
Again, it steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans and Profits off theft. You cannot possibly support that. It is inherently exploitative and
abusive by creation and design.
Please stop OpenAI from  being able to m ake things worse. I don't want to be rude, but if you allow them  to do what they please, it's just
proof of how m any bad people are in the White House.
