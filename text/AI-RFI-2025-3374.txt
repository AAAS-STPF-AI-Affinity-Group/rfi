General Comment
I am  not ok with the US Governm ent the right to override copyrights to train its system . This is a m ockery to those who are constantly
told they need to com e up with their own ideas yet these AI com panies get free pass. This will hurt m ultiple industries and the general
public of not just the USA but the world
