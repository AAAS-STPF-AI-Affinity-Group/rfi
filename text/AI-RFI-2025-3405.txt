General Comment
I do not believe that artificial intelligence such as this has any place in the future of Am erica. It takes away the jobs of artists and designers
who m ake the backbone of culture within our society, and to sim ply toss that away for the sake of a bottom less pit that offers no future is
not only shortsighted, but greedy and utterly evil to it's very core. If we give AI a pass to the copyright laws we have in place, then we will
no longer be a society of culture and art, but instead of regurgitated ideas warped by a m achine and inbred through it a thousand tim es.
This has no place in Am erica, and will in fact im pact m y votes from  here on our.
