General Comment
Giving AI based platform s the ability to steal from  Am erican citizens without their consent is against our rights, but initiatives like this also
will effect relations regarding other countries as well. AI com panies will not stop at stealing data from  people outside the country and can
cause huge disputes with foreign agencies. Do not allow for AI based com panies to profit off of the work of the people.
