I want to originate  that it would be a good idea to lay out the rules/guidelines of the use of AI and it 
should be used constructively. A set of laws should be issued on its use so that the person knows 
what is needed and/or wanted when using AI. Any suppressive actions by t he use of AI should be 
stopped. I realize that this might be already being thought with but I thought I should say it anyways. 
Thank you for letting us give our input and for caring!
