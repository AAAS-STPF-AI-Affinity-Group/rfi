General Comment
Hi,
I do not want generative AI to have a place I. The future of Am erica. My livelihood and passions have m e creating videos and writing for
people to enjoy, have a m achine steal m y creations (and steal it has; m y writing has been found in Metaâ€™s dataset am ong others) is an act
of theft and an insult. 
This is not what the United States stands for. 
Thank you,
