General Comment
I am  an artist and art is m y only source of incom e. I've spent m y life, over 30 years, dedicated to honing m y skills. I've developed
debilitating conditions from  working. I've sacrificed m y body to m y art. I don't regret that, because I am  An Artist.
I did not work so hard, sacrifice so m uch, and dedicate m y life to AI. So that m y work could be stolen by GenAI scraping against m y will,
without m y consent, to have other profit from  m y labor. To have those that have never toiled a day in their life to profit from  everything
I've done and worked for.
This absolutely cannot pass. This is unacceptable. This will destroy even m ore than what has already been.
