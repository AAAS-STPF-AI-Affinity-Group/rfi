General Comment
Do not let OpenAI use copyrights m aterial to train their AI, it is STEALING! I don't think AI has a place in the future of the U.S, I think it
is a m ajor threat. It steals jobs, it steals copyright m aterial, it consum es so m uch energy. And it doesn't even work, it tells people to eat
glue, and that poisonous m ushroom s are edible, because it doesn't have any knowledge, it's just a glorified autocom plete. It is a scam .
Som e people in Governm ent want to im plem ent it to control very sensitive sectors, and it will cause those system s to fail, because again,
OpenAI's 'AI' doesn't actually know anything. If anything, AI should be outlawed and Open AI should be shut down or banned from
Governm ent affairs. 
OpenAI steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans and Profits off theft, it is a danger to the system s that run our governm ent, and the
hundreds of m illions of people who rely on those system s. You cannot possibly support that.
