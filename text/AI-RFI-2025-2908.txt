General Comment
Im  going to keep this short and brief. I do NOT condone any possibility for OpenAI to be legally allowed to steal from  artists. The
creation of traditional and digital m edia com es from  real people with real ideas. Artificial pixels and codes cannot and will never be able to
replicate the skill needed for creative output. Again, I DO NOT support this executive order. Thank you for your tim e
