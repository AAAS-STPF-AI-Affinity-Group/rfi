Dear Mr. D’Souza, 
Utah’s Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy is pleased to share information that may help with 
the development of a federal AI Action Plan. Utah has taken a pro-innovation approach to AI 
policy. To further promote innovation in AI deployment, we propose that the federal government 
create its own regulatory relief sandbox that can apply in combination with state-level sandbox 
programs, to encourage innovation and the development of novel business models, and empower 
state regulatory relief programs. 
I. Utah’s Office of AI Policy takes on an active approach to AI innovation
SB 149 - In 2024, Utah’s SB 149, the Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, established a framework 
of integrating innovative AI technologies within the state of Utah.1 This was one of the first 
AI-related bills in the nation and embodies Utah’s common-sense, light-touch regulatory 
approach. Key provisions of the bill include: 1.Granting users of generative AI technology the right to know when they are interacting
with an AI system.
2.Clarifying that liability for an AI system’s actions rests, by default, with the person
controlling the AI.
3.Creating the Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy to develop innovative regulatory
solutions and pave the way for new, AI-powered business models.

Utah’s SB 149 not only positioned the state as a leader in AI policy but also set a precedent for 
the nation. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) adopted it as the basis for their 
Model State Artificial Intelligence Act.2 Unlike heavy-handed regulatory approaches seen 
elsewhere, SB 149 fosters AI development through regulatory flexibility, stakeholder 
collaboration, and innovation-friendly policies that promote economic growth. 
The Learning Lab - The Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy operates a Learning Lab, which 
serves as a research and policy incubator. Through this initiative, we establish learning agendas 
to analyze key AI policy challenges and make data-driven recommendations to the state 
legislature. 
Utah’s regulatory mitigation program - To effectively foster AI development while ensuring 
responsible deployment, we use regulatory mitigation agreements with companies. These 
agreements provide tailored regulatory relief under state law, offering flexibility for companies 
as they create, train, and deploy AI systems. In the first few months of our office’s operation, we 
have seen several successes in assisting the development of innovative AI solutions in Utah. Two 
examples follow.  
Case study 1: AI and mental health ElizaChat is a company that developed an AI chatbot to help 
support teenagers with common mental health-related concerns. Utilizing our office’s regulatory 
mitigation program, the company has begun beta testing this chatbot in situations where existing 
law may consider this a violation of occupational licensing laws, but where it is possible that AI 
could have a transformative impact. ElizaChat’s business model would be much riskier without 
the regulatory relief program. 
Case study 2: AI in the classroom Utah law requires extensive vetting of educational materials 
before they can be used in public school classrooms. Applications of generative AI are hard to 
“vet” in the traditional sense, so working with the Utah State Board of Education, we developed 
a permissive approach to classroom AI applications so long as the software is tested and parents 
are able to engage in the software. This has empowered districts to deploy new software 
solutions with less red tape.  
II. Our proposal: a state-federal partnership for AI policy
Potential for synergy - While our office has taken proactive steps to foster AI development, 
many key aspects of AI policy, such as financial services law, health data privacy, and 2 American Legislative Exchange Council. ALEC Policy Champions. Dec. 2024.

educational uses, remain at least partially federally preempted. This limits our ability to provide 
regulatory certainty to AI developers and hinders innovation at the state level. 
By leveraging state-level innovation, policymakers can “divide and conquer” on AI policy 
challenges, refining best practices at the local level while ensuring national progress remains 
cohesive, collaborative, and forward-thinking. 
Proposed collaboration - To address this problem, we propose the following initiatives: 
1.Federally recognized AI regulatory sandboxes: Establish a framework that encourages
states to create regulatory sandboxes, like Utah’s, with federal collaboration. This would
permit AI companies to pilot innovative applications with temporary exemptions from
conflicting federal and state requirements.2.State-Federal AI policy coordination: Develop a structured mechanism for regular
collaboration between state AI offices and federal agencies to share data, express industry
concerns, and request temporary waivers in federally preempted areas to implement
experimental state AI policies while remaining aligned with national AI leadership
objectives.By implementing these measures, the federal government can leverage state efforts to accelerate 
AI policy innovation while ensuring AI regulations remain flexible, adaptive, and globally 
competitive. 
Examples of potential state-federal sandbox coordination 
Case study 1: Financial AI innovation States could pilot AI-driven underwriting models for 
credit and lending, experimenting with alternative data sources–such as rental and utility 
payment history–to improve access to credit. These trials would operate under federal consumer 
protection sandboxing standards, ensuring transparency and fairness while allowing states to 
assess AI’s impact on financial stability and risk assessment. 
Case study 2: Education AI pilots Universities could implement AI-driven personalized learning 
systems that adapt coursework in real-time based on student performance and engagement. 
These state-led pilots would be conducted in combination with federal student data privacy 
sandboxing, ensuring that AI does not compromise educational equity or improperly use 
sensitive student data, while still enabling states to evaluate AI’s role in enhancing learning 
outcomes. 
Case study 3: Privacy and transparency States could experiment with different explainability 
standards for AI-driven decisions in areas like hiring, healthcare, and consumer services. By 3 


testing varied approaches to algorithmic transparency, states could help refine best practices for 
ensuring that AI-driven outcomes are understandable to consumers and regulators–while 
operating within a federal sandbox framework for disclosure requirements that prevents 
deceptive or unfair practices. 
III. Conclusion
America’s AI future depends on a policy approach that is agile, collaborative, and forward 
thinking–one that fosters technological innovations, promotes economic competitiveness, and 
ensures the nation stays at the forefront of AI-driven progress. A structured state-federal AI 
partnership would enable real-world policy testing at the state level while ensuring the U.S. 
remains competitive, adaptive, and forward-thinking. By leveraging state-led experimentation 
within a national framework, policymakers can foster responsible AI development, protect the 
public, and maintain U.S. leadership in AI innovation.
