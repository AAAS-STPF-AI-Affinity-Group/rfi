General Comment
I hold BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering (focus on m achine learning, 1993) and com puter sciences (focus on com puter
architecture, 2001) and I am  likely going to becom e hom eless along with m y wife.
There are m any hom eless people in the USA, m any of whom  are good people, but m ay not have the educational background that I have.
Machine learning (AI) technology and it's ease of use in accessing archived inform ation and expressing it in an easy to digest form  using
large language m odels represents a way to get those who have no usable skills working again.
I would like to see the Trum p Presidency find a way to leverage unused US Citizen workers to advance the goals of the wealthy in the
USA instead of im porting m ore talent via the H-1B program .
Sincerely,
Todd M. Bezenek, E.I.T.
