 COMMENTS OF INCOMPAS 
 Developing an Artiﬁcial Intelligence Action Plan 
 Introduction 
 Since its founding in 1981, INCOMPAS has established itself as a prominent 
 trade association in Washington, D.C., dedicated to promoting open 
 networks, open markets, and the open Internet. Representing a broad tent of 
 competitive communications and infrastructure leaders, as well as 
 technology companies, INCOMPAS has a long and consistent history of 
 championing policies that foster innovation, competition, and consumer 
 choice.  Through the Artiﬁcial Intelligence Competition Center (AICC), 
 INCOMPAS now continues its important policy development work, seeking 
 to educate stakeholders on the implications of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and 
 to chart a policy path forward. 
 INCOMPAS believes that sensible policies with appropriate safeguards can 
 ensure AI is integrated securely into the economy while maintaining a climate 
 that encourages continuous innovation and investment.  We believe that this 
 is how the U.S. can maintain its technological and economic edge and how 
 we can bolster U.S. competitiveness, promote entrepreneurial market entry, 
 and help to prepare the next generation for the coming opportunities and 
 global challenges.  As such, we believe in an “All of the Above” approach to AI 
 policy whereby — according to user needs — both open source and closed AI 
 models are able to advance to meet marketplace demands. We call this 
 approach  “Abundant AI.” 
 We have long advocated for a fair and open telecommunications landscape, 
 pushing back against monopolistic practices and ensuring that new entrants 
 can thrive in an open and competitive market. As such, we would like to focus 
 our U.S. AI Action Plan recommendations to issues concerning economic 
 leadership and innovation, and infrastructure modernization.

 I.  Economic Leadership & Innovation
 Our economic leadership and innovation suggestions encompass three 
 areas:  (1) Competition, (2) American Innovation, Regional  Development, and 
 Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs), and (3) Workforce Development 
 and Education. 
 Competition 
 A competitive marketplace is key to driving innovation, investment, and 
 rapid technological advancement, particularly in AI. Open-source models, 
 with contributions from global developers, encourage faster innovation, 
 lower costs, and better products. This competition fosters fresh ideas, 
 challenges traditional practices, and accelerates progress across industries. 
 Maintaining a high standard of openness, transparency, and accountability in 
 this environment is essential for the continued growth of AI in the U.S. and 
 for ensuring global peace and security through strong international 
 leadership. 
 America’s competitive edge in AI stems from its world-class talent pool, 
 investments in R&D and infrastructure, and a vibrant startup ecosystem 
 backed by strong venture capital networks. The U.S. beneﬁts from signiﬁcant 
 AI research and development, with diverse AI applications across industries 
 like healthcare, ﬁnance, and defense, further strengthening its position. This 
 combination of technical expertise, entrepreneurial culture, and ﬁnancial 
 support ensures that the U.S. remains a global leader in AI innovation and 
 international markets. 
 Policy Recommendations 
 ●  Support AI Entrepreneurs:  Entrepreneurs and startups  have always
 been the backbone of American innovation. That should now be
 reinforced through supporting AI startup ecosystems to ﬂourish by
 funding accelerators, encouraging university partnerships, and making
 venture capital more accessible.
 ●  Include Smaller Players in Discussions:  Although we are heartened by
 the U.S. government’s convenings with AI companies, we should also
 encourage smaller AI companies to be present at the table.
 2 


 ●  Spearhead and Support Public/Private Collaboration:  All hands must
 be on deck to maintain the U.S. lead on AI and they must be aligned.
 Public/private coordination of strategy can drive more impactful
 results. Several recent examples abound. The Stargate Project
 demonstrates the ﬁnancial commitment that the private sector can
 make to help achieve economic goals in the national interest while the
 government can support expediting permitting and production.
 ●  International Collaboration:  Targeted international  collaboration
 should aim to prevent a fragmented landscape of frameworks, which
 reduces productivity and hinders innovation. The recent National
 Security Presidential Memorandum “America First Investment Policy”
 sets forth processes to prioritize and fast-track investments from
 speciﬁc allies.  Similarly, strategic cooperation with like-minded allies
 can strengthen economic gains and development across countries.
 American Innovation, Regional  Development, and SMBs 
 AI presents a signiﬁcant opportunity for economic development in the U.S., 
 but to fully capitalize on its potential, innovation must be sustainable and 
 inclusive. AI adoption is currently concentrated in a few cities, which could 
 lead to an "AI divide" and increased regional inequality. Targeted policies can 
 create regional hubs to expand employment opportunities and foster 
 innovation, ensuring that small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are not 
 left behind in the shift to AI. Policies should support SMBs in adopting AI 
 technologies, helping them stay competitive in this evolving landscape. 
 Policy Recommendations 
 ●  “ Abundant AI:”  The transparency of open source AI  is a valuable
 attribute from both a security perspective and an economic
 perspective. Open source allows third-party access and can be audited
 more easily. There is less risk of biases as both inputs will be more
 diverse, and existing biases can be more easily pinpointed and
 rectiﬁed. Open source can also facilitate more innovation and
 competition, and promote entrepreneurial market entry. Open source
 offerings may also use less data and energy and offer more niche,
 tailored services. Open source AI models built in the US, like Llama, will
 not only support the prosperity and security of the United States, but
 3 


 they will also help establish US open source standards in the global 
 race for AI leadership. 
 Closed models will also undoubtedly have a prominent place in the 
 ecosystem. The major investments and ﬁnancial bets that the largest 
 tech companies are placing on proprietary model AI approaches is 
 evidence of the marketplace building to scale based upon anticipated 
 demand. This is why we call for an approach that encompasses both. 
 ●  More R&D:  We encourage the U.S. to expedite and expand  upon R&D
 initiatives that can support U.S. innovation. We also encourage the
 establishment of programs that support smaller, innovative companies
 that possess the necessary technical capabilities. The Defense
 Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) support for startups can
 be an important vehicle for identifying and supporting home-grown
 technology startups. Recently, Encharge AI, a DARPA-funded
 semiconductor startup developing analog chips, raised $100 million in
 Series B.  1  In addition, DARPA will launch a domestic  hub for
 prototyping advanced semiconductor fabrication techniques. There is
 room for more investment to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor
 industry.
 ●  Coordinated Technology Development Strategy:  The U.S.  government
 should facilitate increased investment and innovation in AI and other
 emerging and complementary technologies, such as robotics or
 quantum computing.  The government can itself make  investments as
 well as promote investments in strategic technologies.
 ●  Government-Led Signaling:  The U.S. government can  use its
 purchasing power to guide the direction of AI development and to help
 drive adoption within the public sector, particularly to drive more
 efficiency. It can do so by better communicating its own needs and
 requirements to the market, reforming procurement practices, and
 making its own massive data assets available to the market in

 affordable ways. Directly signaling its needs can not only result in 
 better-suited technology but can also promote and accelerate the 
 advancement of speciﬁc clusters and subsectors as needed. 
 ●  AI Procurement Reform:  Larger players are moving quickly  into the
 government AI procurement market.  2  Startups and smaller  ﬁrms —
 which are often the drivers of new technology — will face increasing
 difficulty competing with large vendors in government procurement
 contracts. This will stiﬂe their ability to grow, invest further in their
 companies, and innovate. Congress should work with the relevant
 departments and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to
 create a program that allocates part of the procurement budget to
 purchases from qualiﬁed startups. Furthermore, the OMB can conduct
 outreach to help departments and agencies understand that the place
 of AI tools is separate and distinct from other software and that
 startups and midsize vendors are capable and well-positioned to
 provide these products. Given the Department of Defense (DoD) is one
 of the largest buyers of these services, special attention should be paid
 to its role and its procurement practices. Revised procurement
 processes in the national security realm can be vital to opening new
 markets for smaller players to compete. Simpliﬁcation of these
 processes can help players with limited teams or no prior experience.
 Finally, government AI procurement should be careful to remain
 technology neutral, considering both open source and closed models
 and systems as appropriate.
 ●  Public Dataset Availability:  The federal government can help the
 development of AI models by making its vast data resources available
 to developers and researchers. This information would include a variety
 of sources that contain valuable demographic, economic, and cultural
 data, enabling models to contain factually correct information
 covering a signiﬁcant period of time. The Department of Commerce
 (DoC) has already established an “AI and Open Government Data

 Assets Working Group.”  3  We encourage other agencies to similarly 
 create working groups and guidelines to make their data available for 
 AI training in affordable and easily accessible ways. 
 ●  University Support:  University research is a critical leg to continued
 U.S. innovation. University researchers, not constrained by a company’s
 agenda, are more free to pursue experimental or public good research.
 They are, however, limited by resources.
 ●  Expanding Public Sector Expertise:  Protecting U.S.  innovation will
 require that government officials and staff have specialized skills and
 knowledge, adequate experience, and sufficient expertise in making
 decisions related to AI and other emerging technologies. In addition to
 providing expert AI training to existing staff, the U.S. government
 should proactively recruit leading experts from academia and the
 private sector. Programs like the AI Talent Surge and U.S. Digital Corps
 should be expanded to meet this acute need.
 ●  Federal Direction for Regional Initiatives:  Congress  should work with
 local stakeholders to ascertain what additional geographic locations
 could beneﬁt from what is needed to become a future hub. Congress
 could work together with local employers but also scale up
 place-based investments in emerging AI communities. Renewed
 funding through the NDAA for the DoC’s Regional Technology and
 Innovation Hubs program is allowing for new awards that will have
 regional impact as well as support national economic development and
 national security.
 ●  Small Business Support:  Small businesses will need  funding or
 know-how depending on their size. While the SBA does offer some
 training workshops, more widespread and easily accessible resources
 can help small businesses integrate AI quickly and easily. The
 December 2024 Bipartisan House Task Force on AI Report suggestions

 6 


 lightening compliance burdens for small businesses is practical and 
 implementable.  4 
 Workforce Impact and  “ AI Education for All” 
 AI offers signiﬁcant potential to enhance productivity and creativity by 
 automating mundane tasks, but it also poses challenges, particularly in terms 
 of job displacement. To fully capitalize on AI’s beneﬁts, policies must focus 
 on upskilling workers and creating new job categories to support those 
 affected by technological changes. While AI’s impact on productivity has 
 been modest so far, its potential for exponential growth remains signiﬁcant. 
 With the right policies, including upskilling, retraining, and education system 
 reforms, AI could help revitalize the middle class and ensure the U.S. remains 
 competitive and prosperous in the evolving global economy. 
 Policy Recommendations 
 ●  More Workforce Impact Research:  Congress should work  with relevant
 government departments and other stakeholders to study workforce
 impact across different industries, functions, and geographies — and
 over time. These parties should also work together to determine which
 new jobs will likely be created by AI and other emerging technologies.
 These analyses can then help determine speciﬁc education and
 upskilling policies based on skills needs.
 ●  Incentives for Worker Training:  The growing use of  AI, even if only for
 complementing workers, imply a great need for worker training or
 retraining. Federal or local governments could provide this training or
 provide incentives for corporate training.  5 
 ●  Creation of Focused Workforce Development Programs:  The U.S.
 needs to create a myriad of opportunities and programs to develop a
 new generation of workers. Some can focus on community and

 vocational schools, while others can be regionally focused, addressing 
 the speciﬁc needs of a region. 
 ●  Revamped Curriculum:  Critical thinking, problem-solving,  and
 teamwork should be integrated as key components of the K-12
 curriculum. Computer science and AI literacy should also be included
 in the K-12 curriculum across the U.S.,  “AI Education for All,”  not unlike
 the “Internet for All” program in its goal of improving digital equity.
 Congress can work together with state authorities to build programs
 that make additional STEM and technology learning opportunities
 available at the K-12 level. Furthermore, policymakers can work with
 industry and universities to identify and coordinate collaboration
 opportunities across the K-20 timeline.
 ●  Targeted Immigration Reform:  Since 2000, half of all  U.S. startups
 valued at $1 billion or more have been founded or co-founded by
 immigrants.  6  Speciﬁc immigration reforms can help  the U.S. continue
 to attract and retain top talent in the country.  The U.S. government
 should work to determine the available AI (and related sectors’) talent
 pool in the U.S. and abroad and to create mechanisms to attract and
 vet those individuals to work in the U.S. Congress should also make it
 easier for graduates with relevant STEM and AI skills and qualiﬁcations
 to remain in the U.S. by streamlining processes to obtain green cards.
 Furthermore, Congress could raise the current cap on
 employment-based STEM visas.  Immigration reform could attract
 individuals and entrepreneurs with specialized AI or STEM skills.  7

 II.  Infrastructure Modernization
 Our infrastructure modernization suggestions encompass three areas:  (1) 
 Broad Infrastructure and Delivery of Communications Services, (2) Spectrum 
 Policy, and (3) Energy Infrastructure. 
 Broadband Infrastructure and Delivery of Communications Services 
 Broadband infrastructure is essential for AI development as it ensures 
 high-speed internet access, which is critical for AI technologies to function 
 effectively. Expanding broadband coverage, particularly in underserved 
 areas, along with investments in computing resources and electricity 
 infrastructure, will enable the widespread use of AI applications. Additionally, 
 AI can enhance the delivery and security of communications services, such as 
 combating illegal robocalls and robotexts. Policies promoting open Internet 
 rules will ensure that consumers have unfettered access to AI applications 
 and lawful online content. 
 However, the broadband industry faces signiﬁcant challenges, including the 
 risk of sabotage by malicious actors and the difficulty of controlling access 
 points. While AI can improve security, it also introduces new risks. AI is 
 already providing efficiencies in network optimization and workforce 
 management, leading to better customer experiences and reduced costs. 
 Yet, providers deploying broadband networks continue to encounter barriers 
 such as excessive access fees, permitting delays, and restrictive commercial 
 agreements, which hinder competition and slow deployment to underserved 
 communities. Encouraging market-based solutions, infrastructure sharing, 
 and open access will help address these challenges. 
 Policy Recommendations 
 ●  Improving Physical Access:  To support broadband network  availability,
 policymakers should break down existing barriers to fast and
 affordable deployment. They should speed broadband providers’
 access to public rights-of-way (ROW) by accelerating permit approval
 by implementing applicable shot clocks and charging reasonable fees.
 Policymakers should also ask state and local governments, utilities, and
 railroads to publicly disclose their fees and ensure that they are
 competitively and technologically neutral, non-discriminatory, and
 based on their actual, objectively reasonable costs for access to ROW,
 9 


 poles, and conduit. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
 and states should modernize their pole access rules to set speciﬁc 
 timeframes for large deployments. Lastly, policymakers should examine 
 unreasonable door fees and inside wiring disputes prevalent in 
 residential and commercial multiple tenant environments (MTEs) while 
 reaffirming the beneﬁts of neutral host operations for MTE rooftops. 
 ●  AI-Powered Infrastructure Mapping and Deployment:  Use AI to create
 detailed, real-time maps of existing broadband infrastructure and
 identify areas with gaps in deployment. This can assist policymakers in
 targeting investments and incentivizing public-private partnerships for
 deploying broadband where it is needed most.  This would streamline
 the planning and construction of broadband infrastructure, reducing
 costs and enabling more accurate, competitive investments in
 underserved regions. AI can also assist in predictive maintenance and
 optimizing network performance for new deployments. AI tools for
 infrastructure mapping could be utilized to deploy ﬁber networks more
 efficiently by analyzing geographic and demographic data.
 ●  AI to Reduce Regulatory Barriers for Small ISPs:  Use  AI to simplify
 regulatory compliance and reduce the burden on smaller Internet
 service providers (ISPs) entering the broadband market. AI could
 automate reporting processes, predict potential regulatory violations,
 and ensure that smaller providers meet compliance standards without
 excessive administrative costs. By lowering regulatory and compliance
 costs, AI can encourage more competition by enabling smaller ISPs to
 compete effectively with larger, established providers. This could
 accelerate broadband deployment in areas currently underserved by
 large providers.  Automation tools in regulatory compliance can be
 explored to streamline processes for small businesses and startups in
 various industries.
 Spectrum Policy 
 Spectrum is a vital resource for our nation’s communications infrastructure, 
 and effective management of its allocation and use is crucial for the AI 
 ecosystem. Maximizing spectrum availability and efficiency can beneﬁt AI 
 applications, which can also play a role in optimizing spectrum management 
 10 


 and wireless network deployment. AI has the potential to enhance spectrum 
 efficiency by dynamically allocating resources in real time, analyzing large 
 datasets to predict demand, and reducing interference. 
 AI can also help detect and mitigate harmful interference by identifying 
 patterns and anomalies in spectrum usage, allowing for quicker resolution of 
 issues. Additionally, AI can assist in ensuring regulatory compliance by 
 continuously monitoring spectrum use, detecting violations, and enforcing 
 policies, ensuring proper management and control of spectrum resources. 
 Policy Recommendations 
 ●  AI-Driven Spectrum Management and Allocation:  Implement  AI
 technologies to optimize spectrum management and allocation. By
 using AI to dynamically assess and manage spectrum usage, regulators
 can allocate broadband spectrum more efficiently, especially in rural or
 underserved areas. AI can identify underutilized spectrum in real-time,
 allowing for more ﬂexible and competitive access. This would increase
 competition among ISPs, reduce entry barriers for smaller ISPs, and
 improve overall spectrum utilization for broadband services,
 particularly in high-demand areas.
 ●  AI-Enabled Dynamic Spectrum Sharing:  Leverage AI for dynamic
 spectrum sharing, where multiple wireless operators or services can
 share the same spectrum bands based on real-time demand. AI can
 manage spectrum usage by continuously monitoring traffic patterns
 and adjusting allocations to avoid interference and maximize
 efficiency.  This would allow for more efficient use of spectrum,
 especially in crowded urban areas or during peak usage times. It also
 opens up opportunities for smaller providers to access spectrum more
 ﬂexibly, fostering wireless competition. This approach can reduce the
 need for static, exclusive spectrum licenses, enabling more dynamic
 and competitive wireless broadband deployments.
 ●  AI to Automate and Optimize Licensing Processes:  Implement  AI tools
 to streamline and optimize the spectrum licensing process, making it
 more efficient and transparent. AI could analyze applications, predict
 spectrum needs based on usage trends, and recommend optimized
 license terms that consider current and future demand.  By reducing
 11 


 bureaucratic delays and administrative overhead, AI-driven licensing 
 could speed up the deployment of wireless broadband infrastructure, 
 particularly for smaller providers that may struggle with lengthy 
 regulatory processes. Automating parts of the licensing process can 
 also help regulators allocate spectrum more fairly and efficiently, 
 fostering greater competition in the wireless market.  AI tools are 
 already being explored in various regulatory settings to simplify 
 complex application processes, and similar approaches could be 
 applied to spectrum licensing. 
 Energy Infrastructure 
 The rise of AI will require a signiﬁcant boost in energy resources. The 
 challenge will not only be meeting this demand but also sourcing energy in a 
 way that aligns with emissions goals and promotes environmental resilience. 
 Access to reliable and affordable energy is crucial for AI scalability and 
 economic development. The need for energy security is so critical that the 
 Trump Administration has declared a national energy emergency. 
 Geopolitically, China’s control over critical mineral extraction and energy 
 production poses a challenge to U.S. competitiveness in AI. To stay 
 competitive, the U.S. must embrace “energy abundance” and address 
 infrastructure development delays. Energy projects face long lead times, 
 slowing AI growth. While natural gas and hydro power will remain major 
 energy sources, solar, wind, and geothermal energy are expected to lead 
 future growth. Additionally, nuclear energy provides a signiﬁcant portion of 
 carbon-free electricity. Addressing energy availability and reliability will be 
 crucial to maintaining U.S. leadership in AI. 
 Policy Recommendations 
 ●  Visionary Strategy:  At a high level, the federal government  is served
 well by convening a multidisciplinary group of technology, energy, and
 environmental experts to examine the dual goals of energy security and
 sustainability. The recent establishment of the National Energy
 Dominance Council will enable strategic and comprehensive
 assessment and planning concerning energy issues.
 12 


 ●  Grid Modernization:  Grid modernization is important. Congress and
 the Administration should continue to identify ways to incentivize and
 accelerate the use of grid-enhancing technologies and grid expansion.
 ●  Minimize Red Tape:  Build out new sources of energy  by reforming
 permitting processes and making ﬁnancing more accessible.  Congress
 should work with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
 Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy (DoE), and
 state and local regulatory authorities, and utilities to understand and
 create new strategies to remove bureaucratic hurdles, fast-track
 permitting, and secure ﬁnancing from both private and public sources.
 The Executive Order that will allow federal land to be rapidly available
 and prepared for co-located AI data centers and clean power facilities
 is potentially an effective way of cutting through the bottlenecks for
 construction. Additional permitting reforms are needed to ensure that
 natural gas infrastructure can be built quickly to serve AI demand.
 ●  Continued Support for Nuclear:  Nuclear energy is undoubtedly  a clean
 energy that is having a resurgence around the world. Nuclear energy
 will require signiﬁcant investment and time to deploy, but it could be
 considered a longer-term, sustainable source of energy. In the medium
 term, repowering old plants could be one option, as well as converting
 coal to nuclear power. Nuclear fusion is also one technology that is
 garnering interest. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have been
 well-received for their safety features as well as opportunities to
 co-locate with data centers.
 ●  Support for Natural Gas Infrastructure:  Electricity  demand is
 experiencing three times faster growth per year this decade than what
 we have seen in prior decades, driven by increasing electriﬁcation, the
 emergence of new, large-load data centers, and a growth in
 manufacturing. Data centers alone present a challenge, which is
 projected to add nearly 30 gigawatts of electric demand by 2030.  This
 increase in growth reﬂects a major opportunity for our country and
 underscores the need for more natural gas infrastructure to keep up
 with this growing demand. A comprehensive solution that includes
 holistic reforms to all federal infrastructure permitting will help
 13 


 America realize a lower-carbon future while still satisfying the country’s 
 energy needs. 
 ●  Support Efficient Technologies and Methodologies:  The U.S. can
 become better at using existing energy sources by supporting the
 improvement of existing technologies and encouraging the
 development of new energy efficiency technologies. The development
 of energy-efficient technologies and practices, including a ramp-up in
 heat recycling, is critical. Providing grants and funding for new
 technologies, such as advanced cooling systems, energy storage, and
 AI solutions, is essential too. Battery storage will be vital, particularly as
 renewable usage ramps up. Congress can work with the DoE to provide
 subsidies that can help drive this change.  8
 ●  AI as a Tool:  AI software can help drive energy efficiency  grid
 management and offer other beneﬁts. For example, the DoE has
 announced an AI testbed to bring together researchers, national labs,
 and the private sector to research energy-efficient and/or
 energy-ﬂexible AI training and inference.  9  It is  also already developing
 AI tools to improve the way such projects are sited and permitted at
 the federal, state, and local levels as part of its recently launched
 voltAIc Initiative.  10
 ●  Protecting Infrastructure:  AI can be used to mitigate  increased
 cybersecurity threats to energy infrastructure.  The  DoE has launched
 several efforts, including the establishment of the Energy Threat
 Analysis Center, to build partnerships between the public and private
 sectors to mitigate cyber threats to energy infrastructure.

 Cyberattacks will undoubtedly increase. Congress should continue to 
 ensure these solutions are scaled and distributed across the U.S. 
 Conclusion 
 INCOMPAS and the AICC believes that as AI reshapes our economy, security, 
 and society, the United States must act decisively to maintain its competitive 
 edge and ensure that the technology serves all Americans. 
 With regard to the economy, policymakers should ensure we retain our edge 
 by providing innovative entrepreneurs with access to resources and markets 
 through more streamlined procurement processes.  We believe in  “Abundant 
 AI”  whereby — according to user needs — both open  source and closed AI 
 models should advance to meet marketplace demands. An  “AI Education for 
 All”  program will not only focus on upskilling and  retraining the existing 
 workforce but also revamping the education system to prepare for a new 
 generation of workers. Regional development programs will ensure that not 
 just parts, but the whole country can prosper. 
 Modern infrastructure is a prerequisite for AI advancement. Inclusive 
 broadband serves as a foundation for AI development, while AI stands to 
 provide ﬂexibility and efficiency for spectrum management. There is a 
 signiﬁcant AI energy challenge that will need to be addressed through grid 
 modernization and expanding access to diverse sources of energy. 
 We now have a window of opportunity that we cannot miss. It cannot be 
 missed because there exists an alternative outcome in which the world is 
 dominated by “Authoritarian AI,” which is based on values antithetical to the 
 United States. Authoritarian AI rests on state power over individuals, 
 surveillance, and control. Failure to adopt an effective AI policy framework 
 could lead not simply to missing opportunities for greater prosperity and 
 societal growth, but it could lead to the United States being dominated by a 
 world system that suppresses the American way of life.
