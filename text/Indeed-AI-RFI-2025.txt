AI and the Labor Market 
AI is increasingly in ﬂuencing the labor market, reshaping job roles, and creating 
new opportunities across various sectors. While AI automates certain tasks, it also 
augments human capabilities, leading to an important interplay between 
technology and employment. Human-centered skills3 will remain essential in the 
workplace while AI and generative AI (GenAI) tools continue to evolve as their 
adoption in many industries continues to rise. 
AI's Impact on Job Roles and Sectors. The share of US job postings mentioning 
GenAI, while still small overall,4 has climbed rapidly from virtually nothing prior to 
late 2022, when the ﬁrst generation of GenAI tools were widely introduced. And 
while the rapid growth of GenAI’s presence in the workplace shows no signs of 
slowing, there are indicators that the nature of the growth is shifting, driven by a 
heightened focus on the implementation of GenAI tools, in addition to their 
ongoing development. 
As of January 2024,5 only about one job in 1,000 (0.1% of all jobs on Indeed) 
mentioned GenAI. By early 2025, that ratio had roughly tripled to 0.3%, a sign of 
rapidly accelerating employer interest in GenAI. But as rapid overall growth in 
GenAI mentions has continued, the types of jobs overtly noting GenAI are 
changing. In January 2024, the top 10 job titles mentioning GenAI were primarily 
for “makers” of the burgeoning technology, including machine learning engineers,

data scientists, and software architects/engineers. Fast forward a year , and those 
jobs are still prominent, but have been pushed down the list by another quickly 
growing role: management consultants. These professionals traditionally focus on 
helping businesses (their own or others) navigate change and improve processes 
— and, increasingly, to implement GenAI technologies. 
 
Evolving Skill Requirements and Job Creation. The demand for AI expertise is 
transforming the technology job market, with nearly one in four tech job postings 
in the U.S. seeking candidates with AI skills. The information sector leads this 
trend, with 36% of its job postings being AI-related. This surge in demand 
highlights the importance of AI competencies for job seekers aiming to remain 
competitive.  
 The Indeed Hiring Lab assessed6 the ability of GPT-4o, a GenAI model developed by 
OpenAI, to perform more than 2,800 job skills. Each skill was assessed across three 
main areas: The ability of GenAI to provide theoretical knowledge related to the 
skill; the ability of GenAI to solve problems using the skill; and GenAI’s 
determination of the importance of physical presence in utilizing that skill. Even 
though GenAI’s self-determed capabilities may carry signiﬁcant overlap with 
human capabilities, current AI tools can't entirely replace a human worker's ability 
to seamlessly transition between subject matter expertise, problem-solving and 
physical execution in the workplace, however they still have enormous potential to 
boost productivity.  
Overall, GenAI is generally strong at providing theoretical knowledge around many 
skills but less so at using skills to solve problems. And as long as a skill requires 
signiﬁcant hands-on execution, the usefulness of GenAI may remain somewhat 
limited. 
 
Even so, in jobs with a high share of skills that require hands-on execution, like 
nursing, GenAI could help with some repetitive tasks (like documentation) and 
allow workers to refocus on the core skills necessary in these roles. And in more 
stereotypical “oﬃce jobs” at which GenAI tools show more promise, including 
software development, the tools may potentially be able to o ﬀer signi ﬁcant 
knowledge and solve modest problems, emphasizing the importance of continued 
upskilling and ongoing learning for human workers.

Current and Future Perspectives on AI in the Workplace.  According to an Indeed 
survey,7 87% of human resources and talent acquisition leaders and nearly 70% of 
job seekers are currently using AI systems and tools for everything from 
researching companies on the applicant side to drafting job descriptions on the 
hiring side. Another recent Indeed survey8 found that hiring managers struggle 
with manually sourcing unresponsive candidates, while candidates wish 
companies would more thoroughly review their qualiﬁcations before contacting 
them about new opportunities. AI-enabled products and solutions are helping to 
make talent sourcing more eﬃcient and impactful. 
Building a Future-Ready AI Workforce 
A strong workforce strategy is essential to ensuring that AI innovation supports 
economic mobility and job opportunities. The government should play a critical 
role in fostering AI adoption by setting the foundation for responsible innovation, 
ensuring AI advancements, and facilitating a regulatory environment that balances 
oversight with growth. By investing in AI research, supporting industry standards, 
and providing incentives for AI adoption, the government can accelerate the 
integration of AI tools and services across industries. Additionally, government-led 
AI adoption in public services—such as workforce development, talent attraction 
and human capital—can demonstrate AI’s potential while de-risking 
implementation for private-sector enterprises.  A proactive government approach will not only strengthen national AI 
competitiveness but also drive widespread economic beneﬁts through increased 
productivity, job creation, and technological resilience. A workforce strategy that 
prioritizes access to AI skills, economic opportunities, and talent retention will help 
ensure that AI advances economic opportunity for all. To foster a resilient and 
impactful AI workforce, the AI Action Plan should: ●Expand AI Workforce Development Initiatives. Promote federal support in
STEM education, AI-focused vocational training, and research partnerships
to cultivate a pipeline of highly skilled AI professionals.●Enhance High-Skilled Employment Pathways. Streamline and strengthen
programs to attract and retain top global AI talent, ensuring the U.S.
remains a premier destination for AI expertise.

●Support Industry-Led Training & Resource Access. Promote apprenticeships,
public-private partnerships, and AI infrastructure accessibility for startups
and small businesses to facilitate frequent and widespread AI development
and adoption.●Facilitate Workforce Upskilling. Introduce targeted opportunities for
companies of all sizes, including small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs), to
invest in AI workforce training, enabling them to stay competitive in an
AI-driven economy.●Strengthening Public-Private Collaboration. Public-private partnerships are
essential to maintaining U.S. leadership in AI. By fostering collaboration
between industry, subject-matter experts, academia, and government, the
U.S. can drive advancements in trustworthy AI, and workforce development
and upskilling.
Fostering AI Innovation Through Smart, Adaptive Regulation 
To sustain leadership in AI and expand economic opportunity, regulatory 
frameworks must be principles-based, forward-looking, and technology-neutral 
while balancing innovation and responsibility. A smart, adaptive approach will 
provide clarity, consistency, and global alignment, ensuring that AI-driven 
advancements beneﬁt both businesses and workers. Indeed recommends the 
following principles for AI governance: 
1.Align AI Regulation with Existing Frameworks to Prevent Redundancy
Before implementing new AI-speci ﬁc regulations, policymakers should evaluate
how existing laws—such as labor , civil rights, privacy, consumer protection, and
cybersecurity regulations—already govern AI applications. A cohesive regulatory
approach will:●Minimize compliance burdens while ensuring responsible AI use.
●Reduce legal uncertainty by integrating AI oversight into existing
governance structures.
●Support a federal privacy law to mitigate patchwork of laws and regulations,
ensuring clarity for businesses and protecting consumer privacy while
enabling AI-driven hiring innovations.
2.Prevent Regulatory Fragmentation & Promote Market Stability
A fragmented AI regulatory landscape—where compliance varies widely across
jurisdictions—creates uncertainty, raises costs, and can disproportionately impact
small businesses. To mitigate this:
5 


 
 
● Establish a federal AI governance framework that interoperates with 
practical state laws to create consistency. 
● Encourage ongoing regulatory and industry market practices to adapt 
policies to emerging AI developments rather than imposing rigid, 
one-size-ﬁts-all mandates. 
● Ensure AI regulation balances risk-based oversight with the ﬂexibility 
needed to support AI-driven workforce platforms and job-matching 
technologies. 
● A balanced AI innovation ecosystem that embraces both open and 
closed-source model development to foster competition, security, and broad 
industry adoption.  
3. Implement Risk-Based, Scalable AI Compliance Standards 
AI regulation should be proportionate to risk and application context, avoiding 
blanket compliance burdens that stiﬂe innovation. A tiered regulatory approach 
should: 
● Adjust oversight based on an AI system’s risk level and intended use. 
● Provide clear , tailored compliance obligations that re ﬂect a company’s role in 
AI development and deployment, ensuring fair applicability requirements 
across the ecosystem. 
● Enable scalable compliance programs that support companies and 
applications of all sizes, without unnecessary barriers.  
4. Strengthen Leadership in Global AI Governance 
The U.S. must shape AI governance to ensure global competitiveness and facilitate 
cross-border AI adoption. Key actions include: 
● Aligning AI regulations with relevant jurisdictions and international 
regulatory activity to streamline compliance for multinational businesses. 
● Establishing U.S.-led AI competitiveness initiatives, with industry and foreign 
governments, to pursue practical, innovative and responsible AI policy 
frameworks and practices. ● Ensuring AI trade policies reduce foreign regulatory barriers, enabling U.S. 
businesses to compete fairly in AI-driven markets. 
 
5. Advance Public-Private Collaboration to Expand Workforce Opportunity 
Industry, academia, and government must work together to ensure AI adoption 
supports safe use, economic growth and job creation. Key focus areas: 
6 


●Trustworthy AI in hiring – Collaborate on standards for fairness,
explainability, and ethical AI use in workforce applications.
●AI accessibility for businesses – Ensure small businesses and startups can
leverage AI to enhance hiring and workforce eﬃciency.
●Investment in AI infrastructure – Support development of new computing
resources, and eﬃcient AI advancements to drive long-term growth and
innovation.
Advancing AI to Expand Economic Opportunity 
Indeed greatly appreciates NSF’s leadership in developing an AI Action Plan to 
foster AI-driven innovation that beneﬁts workers, job seekers, and businesses. As 
AI reshapes hiring and the labor market, policies must balance risk and 
opportunity to ensure eﬀective and safe participation in AI-driven growth. Overly 
rigid regulations could sti ﬂe AI tools that connect people to jobs and enhance 
hiring e ﬃciency. Indeed remains committed to policies that empower workers and 
employers and looks forward to continued collaboration in building an AI 
ecosystem that drives job growth, productivity, and economic opportunity.
