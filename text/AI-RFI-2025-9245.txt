General Comment
Hi. I’m  an artist living in New Jersey.
I struggle to m ake ends m eet, but I still love doing what I do, which is to draw som ething. Because that’s all I’ll have when everything’s
done and done. AI, GenAI, whatever this debacle calls itself, is another way for the average working Am erican to suffer. And for what?
Art m ade without sincerity, honesty, and effort, just for haphazardly put together schlock that’s built and stolen from  hardworking artists
that sim ply want to get things done. No one’s speaking for us, so it’s the least I can do here. Please consider not allowing corporations to
grind out whatever leftover juices we have for cheap, m ediocre product that has no virtuous benefits for society as a whole.
