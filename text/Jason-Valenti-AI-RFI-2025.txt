Policy Recommendations on Implementing a 
Tiered Security Clearance Process for Frontier AI 
Workers 
Introduction & Rationale 
In alignment with Executive Order 14179—designed to remove barriers to American AI 
leadership and promote human ﬂourishing, economic competitiveness, and national 
security—this recommendation addresses a critical and increasingly urgent risk in frontier 
AI: the insider threat. U.S. companies are at the forefront of AI innovation, and the most 
signiﬁcant risks can originate from within.  
For the purposes of this recommendation, "Frontier AI workers" refers to individuals with 
direct access to the development, deployment, and security of advanced AI systems with 
national security, economic, and geopolitical implications.  
This includes, but is not limited to: model developers and architects, data scientists 
working on sensitive datasets, cybersecurity professionals specializing in AI systems, and 
individuals with privileged access to AI infrastructure.  
Insider access to sensitive AI technologies, particularly by non-U.S. citizens with ties to 
adversarial nations (deﬁned as nations actively seeking to undermine U.S. interests), poses 
a unique and escalating vulnerability that must be mitigated through rigorous, risk-based 
vetting.

Recommended Framework 
Adopt a tiered security clearance system—mirroring national security protocols—to 
ensure that access to sensitive AI work is limited to individuals meeting escalating levels 
of scrutiny:  
Tier 1 – Baseline Clearance (Controlled for Of ﬁcial Use Only) 
● Scope : Personnel engaged in non-sensitive or public AI research.
● Requirements: Standard background checks, employment veri ﬁcation, and basic
cybersecurity awareness training.
Tier 2 – Intermediate Clearance (Con ﬁdential/Secret Level) 
● Scope : Individuals working on proprietary models, advanced algorithms, or
sensitive datasets critical to national competitiveness.
● Requirements: Enhanced background investigations, including ﬁnancial
background checks, social media analysis, and con ﬂict-of-interest screenings.
Periodic re-assessments are required.
Tier 3 – High-Level Clearance (TS or TS/SCI with Special Compartments) 
● Scope : Personnel involved in projects with signi ﬁcant national security
implications or dual-use applications.
● Requirements: Comprehensive vetting, including in-depth ﬁnancial and personal
history checks, psychological evaluations (where appropriate), continuous
monitoring of online activity, ﬁnancial transactions, and foreign contacts. Strict
compartmentalization and regular debrie ﬁngs with security personnel are
mandatory.
○ Special attention should be given to non-U.S. citizens with ties to adversarial
nations, including disclosure of foreign funding or afﬁliations and
restrictions on travel.

Implementation Strategy 
Standardized Vetting Protocols: 
● Develop uniform federal guidelines detailing speci ﬁc criteria for each clearance
tier, including explicit mandates for the rigorous vetting of non-U.S. citizens.
● Establish industry-wide standards concerning background checks and security
protocols.
● Provide clear de ﬁnitions of adversarial nations.
Oversight & Governance: 
● Establish a multi-agency task force (comprising OSTP , national security agencies,
industry experts, and academic leaders) to oversee implementation, enforce
compliance, and update clearance procedures as needed.
● Clearly de ﬁne roles and responsibilities of all participating agencies.
● Establish clear lines of communication and reporting.
Risk-Based Project Classi ﬁcation: 
● Enable companies to classify AI projects by sensitivity, ensuring that clearance
requirements are proportionate to the risk, while lower-risk innovation remains
unencumbered.● Develop a clear taxonomy of "sensitive AI" projects, categorizing them based on
potential national security and economic risks.
● Provide tools and resources to assist companies in implementing the clearance
process.
International Collaboration Safeguards: 
● Create clear and granular guidelines for international partnerships, including data
sharing agreements, joint research protocols, and security audits of partner
organizations.● Implement protocols for assessing and mitigating foreign in ﬂuence.

Streamlining and Regular Reviews: 
● Explore ways to streamline the clearance process to minimize delays and burdens
on companies, considering leveraging technology for automation.
● Mandate regular reviews of security protocols to adapt to the rapidly evolving AI
landscape.
Precedents & References 
This approach draws on established U.S. policies that restrict sensitive technology from 
foreign manipulation: 
● Export Controls: Measures like ITAR and EAR restrict access to sensitive defense
and dual-use technologies¹.
● Foreign Investment Screening: CFIUS reviews and limits foreign in ﬂuence in
critical technology sectors².
● Defense Contractor Clearances: Rigorous security clearances ensure that only
vetted personnel access classiﬁed projects³.
Conclusion 
Executive Order 14179 sets the stage for a revitalized U.S. AI policy framework—one that 
prizes innovation while securing national interests. A tiered security clearance process 
directly addresses the insider threat by ensuring that only rigorously vetted individuals 
have access to the nation’s most sensitive AI projects. Implementing this framework will 
protect critical intellectual property, fortify national security, and sustain U.S. leadership 
in AI.

1. International Traf ﬁc in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) have long ensured that sensitive technology remains secure.
2. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a proven
mechanism for safeguarding national security by scrutinizing foreign investments in
critical sectors.
3. Security clearance processes for defense contractors illustrate the ef ﬁcacy of rigorous
vetting and continuous monitoring in protecting sensitive technologies.
