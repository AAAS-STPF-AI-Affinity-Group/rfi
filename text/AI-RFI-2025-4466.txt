General Comment
Pillaging the intellectual property of artists, authors, and creative professionals without perm ission or com pensation is not a business
m odel, it is theft. And those who don't have skill, or knowledge base, to train effective m odels with their own original content definitely
shouldn't get the green light to guide AI technology in general. Any public AI program  or policy m ust follow international copyright law
and ensure the tech benefits the public, as it can only function with the data we have collectively created. Otherwise, the federal
governm ent will be allowing a one-tim e extraction of value from  m illions of hardworking people, effectively putting them  out of business,
thus dealing a death blow to the Am erican creative sectors and doom ing us to rehashed m ediocre entertainm ent until another nation eats
our lunch.
