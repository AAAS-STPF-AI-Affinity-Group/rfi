This document is approved for public dissemination.
My name is Cassandra (Cassie) Slossar.
I find ai extremely worrisome! For years now online "information" has been sketchy at best,  
and blatantly biased... ex Wikipedia stating that a document that it had, relies too much on first  
sources
From one day to the next, you can either find something online or not. That includes "years"  
too
The other day a fb memories came up, it showed that supposedly two years ago a group I have  
had a different name... I changed the name of the group last week, NOT two yrs. ago
A fb group might not seem like much, but what about the name of a disease, or the  information 
about it?
Or American history (which wikipedia already doesn't like)
Or ANY information about what's going on in our country now. It's not more journalists "in"  
the White House that is the answer, it's the information getting "out"...
and that's all we, and our children see 
Tv/phone is all the same,
people or ai ON the tv is all the same... in actuality
a "reality" outside what is on tv doesn't mean anything (covid scamdemic showed us that)
A lot didn't believe that, but how many more times... years till those numbers of disbelief  
dwindles down to zero?
So a computer/ai controlling ALL knowledge of past, present, and future 
Supposedly we, as people are supposed to be too smart for that
