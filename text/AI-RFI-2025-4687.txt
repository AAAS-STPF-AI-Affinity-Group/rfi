General Comment
I am  against the current form s of generative AI being developed by com panies like OpenAI. This is IP theft, not to m ention hugely
dam aging to our environm ent, our water, our energy. It m akes people worse at their jobs, m akes them  less capable of critical thought,
m akes less capable coders. Spend billions of dollars to create a chatbot that tells you incorrect answers? No.
