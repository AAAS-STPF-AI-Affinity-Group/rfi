General Comment
While generative AI's base to detect what im ages are, it has been useful in science and does not need the ability to recreate various form s
of m edia such as im ages, video and m usic as well as the ability to recreate writing, code and speech.
Consent is a m ust for things to be created. AI needs to be controlled and used for good and constructive things. Reselling and claim ing
ownership of som ething that was generated without the consent of everyone involved is wrong in every capacity. 
I believe m ost people want a real Am erica, and world for that m atter. We don't have a need for fake things that are easily and lazily m ade.
Our current way of life is created on hard work and skill and without either one of these things we becom e m indless drones who cannot
think.
In short. AI should not be developed with the intent on blatant theft. No am ounts of bending the rules should be applied. AI's place in the
world is for it to be a tool and not the final product.
