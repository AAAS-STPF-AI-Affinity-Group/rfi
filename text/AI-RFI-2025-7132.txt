General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. AI is not even reliable AT ALL to give any correct answers to anything any
tim e. It is a technology FAR from  being useful in any real capacity at this tim e and likely for a long while. Shut it down!!
