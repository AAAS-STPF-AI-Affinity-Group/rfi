Our government has already proven that we overspend and line the pockets of the already 
wealthy. Billions upon billions spent for an inferior product. Is there going to be an investigation 
on where those funds went? You know, the subsidies paid from our mo ney. It was made obvious 
a couple of weeks ago that China is outpacing us and if you think throwing $500B at it all I see is 
a cash grab for those working on it. China did it in less than a year with inferior chips and FAR 
outdid what our current AI is cap able of. I have never understood why China is constantly called 
the enemy when they seem to be helpful for our economy in a number of ways. Why aren't we 
working with them? Can you even fathom what our best and their best, working together, could 
do with e ven half that money??? If your plan is to simply give a ton of money to some tech 
billionaires that have already proven they are behind. What new science or techniques do they 
have? What will be different this time? All I see here is a handout to the ultra  wealthy tech giants 
to simply continue creating inferior products. Why does anyone thing it will turn out different if 
we are taking the same approach? I am all for AI advancement but we were proven that we are 
far behind. This is a handout to the wealthy . Stop funding corporation with subsidies from our 
tax money if you are serious about fiscal responsibility. We have not been seeing that and this is 
a clear action against the people.
