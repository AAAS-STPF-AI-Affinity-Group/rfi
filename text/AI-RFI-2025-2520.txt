General Comment
AI has no benefit for the future of Am erica, it is nothing m ore than a sm okescreen designed to steal from  people and m axim ize shareholder
profits. People m ust be protected from  this blatant plagiarism  algorithm , and the Am erican governm ent should prioritize the individual
liberty of its people over the greed of the corporate drive behind this new tech scam . Our artists and engineers are already poor and
hungry, caving to the dem ands of these technological tyrants will only lead to death. Already AI is being used for unam biguously evil
purposes, it m ust be legislated, regulated, and Am ericans m ust be protected. The future of Am erica with AI at its side is nothing m ore than
the future of a landfill in the place where our once great nation stood.
