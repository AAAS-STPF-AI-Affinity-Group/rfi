General Comment
Devalueing the training data rem oves opportunities for licensing and econom ic collaboration with artists and other data providers. If,
however, an environm ent of cooperation with creatives was adopted then we m ay actually see an acceleration of AI developm ent in the
U.S. as the training data will be of higher quality and will be better fit for purpose.
