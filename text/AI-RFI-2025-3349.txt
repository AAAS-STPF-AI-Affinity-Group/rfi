General Comment
Ai, as it exists now is m ade off of stolen data. Every single person who had their artwork stolen to be put in an Ai database should be
properly com pensated or the database should be em pty. If the technology cant survive without theft it shouldn't survive. Ai is also
destroying the environm ent with data farm s, it takes enough energy to power a city when people use just a few prom pts. Its also been
used to have people’s identity violated by using revenge porn with innocent people and children’s faces. Ai harm s the environm ent, artists,
and children who are victim s of revenge porn. Ai technology is being used for porn of children being used as a bullying tool. Children are
com m itting suicide from  the bulling from  Ai deem  fakes . Ai needs to be heavily regulated but preferably stopped com pletely. The
environm ent and people’s lives are at risk.
