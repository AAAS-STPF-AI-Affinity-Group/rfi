General Comment
Speaking as a person who is both a program m er and an artist, I am  severely opposed to expanding the perm issions private and
governm ent entities have in regards to AI. Studies indicate that AI use decays the user's ability to think critically and independently. As
such, I believe that AI should be a heavily restricted and m onitored technology, regulated in a way sim ilar to leaded paints or nuclear
m aterials.
