General Comment
Training AI on copyrighted or tradem arked m aterial is intellectual property theft, period.
If I can request an AI bot to m ake a song that im itates living acts like Queens of the Stone Age or Kendrick Lam ar, or a picture in the
style of living artists like Kara Walker or Alan Moore, it's directly stealing those people's work.
AI should never be used to steal people's intellectual property that's protected by copyright, tradem ark and m ore.
AI products should also NEVER becom e copyrightable.
