General Comment
Generative AI is an over-hyped and im m ature technology that is being utilized recklessly as a substitute for hum an decision m aking in
applications where the technique has no relevance. Until the fad has passed and AI is applied with m ore forethought and consideration;
generative AI should not receive governm ent assistance and the federal governm ent should not rem ove consum er protections in a tim e
when com panies are dead set on using AI in ways that are harm ful to the public good.
