General Comment
All autom ation is disruptive, but not all autom ation is good disruptive, especially when the econom y is ill-prepared to take the load of
unem ployed people who have had their jobs, industries, and entire career paths elim inated.
Current AI software is built on the stolen copywrited products of large and sm all businesses. It is the equivalent to large-scale industrial
espionage, using the products they created to replace their labor as a cost of business.
We don't need to be at the forefront of autom ation, we need to through our weight behind the Am erican worker, be that blue, white, or
pink collar.
