General Comment
businesses have laws regulations and support to prevent other com panies from  taking and m onetizing ideas they m ade or m ake.
allowing this is pass allows the strongest com panies to take private sector ideas innovations and work and use it to create or steal ideas
from  this sector, m onotize them , and claim  them  as their own.
this will only create a need for businesses to then protect their ideas from  this idea theft technology, only leading to further theft, and a
system  that cannot be regulated. 
left unregulated, only entities with enough m oney to both profit and fight the m isuse for them selves will succeed, leading to a farther fall
from  an every day working m an or wom an from  being able to innovate, solve problem s, or create new products, since they can no longer
claim  them  as their own, as the m ention, show or sight of their fruits of labor will becom e the seeds of anothers without com pensation.
furtherm ore it creates a m onopoly of any system s currently in place as if idea theft is worked around in this m anner only benefit users who
can afford any fight in the first place, m eaning outside of extrem e wealth, corporations are the only ones who can m ake and create, stifling
all other sources of it.
