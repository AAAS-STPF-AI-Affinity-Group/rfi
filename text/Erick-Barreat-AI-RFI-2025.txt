Introduction 
T o maintain and expand the United States' leadership in Arti ﬁcial Intelligence, 
we must take an actionable, strategic approach. AI should not just be another 
tool used when convenient—it should be the foundation for optimizing 
government operations. T o accomplish this, I propose a dual-policy 
framework: 
1. AI First Policy – Ensuring successful AI adoption and integration across
federal agencies.
2. AI Security Policy – Establishing governance, compliance, and security
standards to protect AI-driven processes and data.
These policies, if executed correctly, will foster a thriving, streamlined, and 
efﬁcient government, capable of making informed decisions while 
safeguarding national security and public trust. 
AI First Policy: Driving AI Integration Across Federal Agencies 
The AI First Policy aims to make AI an essential component of government 
workﬂows, ensuring measurable ef ﬁciency gains. However, AI adoption 
cannot be successful without education and feedback mechanisms that 
actively engage those who will use it. 
1. High-Level AI Education Program


W e must establish an AI literacy program for all technology-using personnel, 
structured around three core pillars: 
● What AI is: Demystifying AI concepts.
● How AI works: Practical applications and real-world use cases.
● Why AI matters: Illustrating AI’s transformative potential in government
operations.
2. Real-World AI Use Cases as Learning Tools
This program should showcase actual AI implementations that have yielded
efﬁciency improvements. By seeing tangible bene ﬁts, personnel will be more
inclined to adopt AI solutions in their own work ﬂows.
3. A Structured AI Feedback & Innovation Layer
T o ensure grassroots innovation, we need a structured feedback process
where government staff can propose AI-driven improvements to their own
workﬂows.
● The Department of Government Ef ﬁciency (DOGE) (or equivalent
agency) should serve as the intake body for AI adoption ideas.
● Ideas should undergo a formal vetting process that evaluates feasibility
and potential return on investment (ROI).
● Once validated, ideas should enter an implementation pipeline,
ensuring they are developed and tested for real-world use.
This bottom-up approach ensures that those who understand their work best 
have a voice in shaping AI-driven efﬁciency improvements. 
4. AI Innovation Loop: Let the Process Self-Sustain
Once the feedback loop is established, the AI adoption process will naturally
gain momentum. Employees who are engaged and empowered will share
opportunities for AI optimization without mandates.
AI Security Policy: Establishing Compliance & Governance 
AI implementation must be paired with strong security protocols to ensure 
that data—both internal and public—is handled responsibly and securely. 
1. Continuous AI Compliance & Governance Framework
An ever-evolving compliance structure should serve as a universal standard
for AI projects in government. This will:


● Ensure consistent security measures across all AI implementations.
● Protect sensitive government and citizen data from foreign and
domestic threats.
● Prevent unauthorized AI transactions through robust logging and
tagging mechanisms.
2. Secure AI Logging & Data Monitoring
Every AI execution—whether it’s a request, transaction, or decision—must be
fully logged and tagged with key attributes:
● Origination of the request (who/what initiated it).
● Mediums and receivers involved (who interacted with it).
● Stored conversation history and uploaded ﬁles at the message state
(ensuring forensic traceability).
A specialized AI Security T eam with the highest clearance levels should be 
responsible for monitoring this data, ensuring: 
● Threat detection and mitigation using AI-powered security analytics.
● Process optimization insights from AI-driven operational data.
● Security- ﬁrst AI innovation, balancing compliance with ef ﬁciency gains.
3. Process Audits & Continuous Oversight
T o maintain accountability and transparency, a specialized AI Security &
Compliance Task Force should be established to:
● Conduct routine AI audits across federal agencies.
● Follow AI-driven processes downstream, identifying ef ﬁciency gaps and
potential risks.
● Provide recommendations on cost-effective AI solutions with clear ROI
projections.
This ensures that every AI-driven process remains ef ﬁcient, ethical, and 
secure. 
Final Thoughts: A Balanced, Human-Inclusive Approach to AI 
An AI-driven government must not mean a government that removes 
humans from the equation. Instead, AI should serve as a force multiplier, 
allowing government personnel to focus on higher-value tasks while AI 
handles the repetitive, data-driven aspects of governance. 


By implementing this AI Action Plan, the United States will remain ahead of 
global AI advancements while protecting national interests. 
If done right, we will build a smarter, faster, and more ef ﬁcient 
government—one that is prepared for the future and committed to serving 
its constituents at the highest level. 
I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this critical discussion. If there is 
any need for clariﬁcation or further elaboration, please do not hesitate to 
reach out. It would be an honor to assist our country in future planning and 
execution of its AI strategy.
