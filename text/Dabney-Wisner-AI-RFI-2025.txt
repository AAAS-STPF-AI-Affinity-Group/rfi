Good  evening,
I am writing to express my opposition to executive order regarding AI. AI steals intellectual
property from writers, artists, and other creators, which should not be allowed. It is also aburden on the environment, draining energy, water, and other precious resources. Furthermore,studies have shown the negative impacts on people and animals living in close proximity to AIdata centers. The reckless use of AI, by individuals and the government, will only havenegative impacts on our world.

Adding that last bit because of the Federal Register requirements.
 
Thank you,
Dabney Kinser
