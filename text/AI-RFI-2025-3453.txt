General Comment
By allowing OpenAI (or any AI generative program s/m odels) to com pletely bypass copyright laws, you are not only infringing on the
rights of ALL copyright holders and creators, you are opening the floodgates to allow anyone to both use and abuse any m aterial for any
purpose. This will cause any and all copyrighted m aterial to be stolen and repurposed, regardless of if it's a freelancer's creation or the
m ascot of a m ajor corporation.
This will also cause a creative stagnation, which will in turn backfire on generative program s, which requires m aterial to scrape and
repurpose. This is effectively "shooting yourself in the foot".
