General Comment
Som eone com es into your hom e, takes the hand crafted whatever you worked on for years, takes the letter you wrote to your first love,
takes the song that you m ade up for your best friend in high school that you sang together over and over, takes the docum ents for the
proposal you wrote that changed the profitability of your business... takes it all, uses it for it's own purposes, claim s ownership, pays you
nothing. That is AI.
In the creative world of arts, letters, design, entrepreneurship AI is so riddle with lim itation and m istake it dim inishes any project while
stealing the work of others. 
At present it is a beta in developm ent tech that is unreliable and especially in the industrial world a physical danger to anyone close to its
utilization. 
Significant regulation is required, 
AI action plan... REGULATION
