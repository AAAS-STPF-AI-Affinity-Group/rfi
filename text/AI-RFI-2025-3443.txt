General Comment
A.I. art is NOT real art. As an artist, I don’t want m y livelihood stolen from  m e by OpenAI. It will take peoples’ art and create nothing
but slop. All A.I. creates is an im age with no thought or m eaning put into it. Do NOT let the governm ent give OpenAI perm ission to steal
other artists’ art.
