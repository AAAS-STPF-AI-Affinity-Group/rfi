General Comment
I am  fully opposed to allowing the unm itigated collection of data from  private content creators to be used profit without appropriate
com pensation for those creators. AI poses a financial threat to m illions of private individuals by stealing their intellectual property for the
benefit of a select few and as such is a net negative for Am erican citizens.
