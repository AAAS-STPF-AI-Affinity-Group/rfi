General Comment
AI is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and the huge legal problem s that will
com e by by enabling them . This also strips rights from  creatives that m ake their livelihoods from  their own work. Why should we allow
these giant corporate leeches to profit by using our hard work for free? If you allow AI scraping like these com panies want you are
m aking copyright laws pointless.
