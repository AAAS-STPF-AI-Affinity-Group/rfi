General Comment
As an author of five academ ic books and approxim ately 10 scholarly articles, I am  dism ayed that AI gets to use and then profit from  m y
copyrighted work. AI com panies steal from  authors, creators, and publishers. AI com panies should be forced to com ply with all copyright
laws and regulations.
