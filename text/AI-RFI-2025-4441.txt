General Comment
AI is a threat to the livelihood of thousands of Am ericans. This sets a dangerous precedent for our future. If AI can take and use im ages
that aren’t theirs, then why can’t any/everybody else? How dam aging will this be to our personal property and the right to life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness?
