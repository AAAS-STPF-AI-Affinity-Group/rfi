General Comment
In its current state, A.I. is nothing m ore than a trendy piece of theft software and dead-end investm ent, providing absolutely no m erit or
benefit to the present or future of Am erica. It actively threatens m y colleagues in creative fields, and it won’t be long before it’s fleecing
Am ericans in every industry and in their private lives. We need a serious reevaluation and stricter set of regulations before m oving forward
with this technology, as it currently only serves to take advantage of those who don’t understand it in a very brief period.
