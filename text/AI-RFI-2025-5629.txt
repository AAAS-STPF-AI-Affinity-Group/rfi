General Comment
AI is a technology, not a creator, and creative people have always used various technologies to aid their creativity, but it was still
ultim ately their own creative process that produced the final work. AI is not the sam e, and needs to be fed original creative work in order
to then generate a derivative work. This is anti-art, anti-artist, anti-hum an. It will devalue original work such that very few will be able to
m ake a living, unless that original work is protected. Do not give AI com panies im m unity from  the theft of art in order to destroy artistry.
It's not worth it. There is zero long-term  gain, only short-term  profits for a few.
