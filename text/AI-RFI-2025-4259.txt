General Comment
Artificial intelligence cannot create anything new. It steals the best of hum an output and regurgitates a half-digested version of it. It is theft
of true creativity, enriching the lazy and entitled off the hard work of others who were willing to put in work to hone their skills. AI cannot
be allowed to train on copywrite-protected m aterial.
