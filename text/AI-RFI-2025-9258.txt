General Comment
I do not think AI in its current state should be m ade a priority by the US federal governm ent. Many com panies prom oting or developing
AI, are basing their m odels on the hard work of others, or copyrighted m aterial.
In addition, AI m odels used for assistance in daily activities are not up to par. Misinform ation is used as a lazy m ethod of research, or
m isleading people into believing false docum entation as facts.
I hope you take m y opinion into consideration before you enforce the Artificial Intelligence Action Act. Thank you.
