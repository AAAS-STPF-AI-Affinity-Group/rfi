General Comment
I don't see m uch use for A.I. in any form  of m y professional or personal life. The current attem pts to create it so far have done nothing but
create am algam ations of nonsense, m ade from  work stolen from  professionals in the creative fields. 
I don't think it has a place in the U.S.A. as a product at all, it just seem s like a lot of m isinform ation has m ade it seem  m ore useful than it
actually is.
