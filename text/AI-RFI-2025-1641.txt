General Comment
What I think of artificial intelligence is that I see it as a threat on taking Am erican jobs and labor, I don't see it as a positive for hum anity;
it's m ore like a curse than a blessing. AI autom ating jobs would displace m any in this country, I really think there should be protections
against AI and algorithm s. to help society and restore our natural intelligence. AI can be a useful tool, and m ay help hum anity, but I see it
as a m achine that driving hum anity apart. I think we should never ever allow AI in the pentagon or any form  of war, it is disastrous for us
as a species. And I really fear AI, that is left unchecked. also I Think AI Art should be banned. even AI video generators. all jobs m ust be
protected, Especially the Entertainm ent Industry from  AI Period. so please regulate this technology for our species sake. please and thank
you.
