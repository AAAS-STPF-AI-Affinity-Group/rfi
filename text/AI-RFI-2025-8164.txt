General Comment
The way that this opens the doors for AI to legalize the theft of work from  artists worldwide is unjustifiably bad. Not only is it bad for
artists' incom es, but it's also awful for the environm ent. There is absolutely no reason that we should be allowing this to com e to fruition.
AI does not have a thriving future, at this rate, and is largely becom ing a scam  at the expense of our tax m oney and livelihoods as
Am ericans. Please reconsider this dangerous path.
