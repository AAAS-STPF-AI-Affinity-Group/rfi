General Comment
I do not believe AI will do anything for the “future of the US,” but would rather tear us down.
AI is theft, and hurts actual hum an innovation and creativity. 
We need to do m ore to stop AI, not give it m ore power. Invest in PEOPLE, not AI. 
AI will further the “dum bing down of Am erica.”
