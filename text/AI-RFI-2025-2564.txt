General Comment
We need m ore regulations around AI developm ent, specifically preventing large language m odels from  being trained on copyrighted
m aterial of any kind (art, m usic, creative writing, etc.). It is a harm ful technology that puts creatively em ployed people at risk, further
hindering the econom y rather than enhancing it. Say NO to this resolution/regulation
