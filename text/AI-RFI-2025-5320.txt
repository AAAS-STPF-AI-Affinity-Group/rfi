General Comment
The use of generative-AI is bad.
It's bad that it's incredibly harm ful to the environm ent and drains us of things like plentiful water supplies for drinking and fighting wildfires.
It's bad for artists whose work is fed to the generative-AI system  without paying for their work being used (it's blatant plagiarism ).
It's bad in that it's easy to fool people who cannot tell the difference between an AI-generated writing prom pt or im age com pared to a real
hum an written prom pt or drawn art.
It's bad that it's not efficient.
It's bad that it's not effective.
It's bad that it's incredibly unprofitable.
