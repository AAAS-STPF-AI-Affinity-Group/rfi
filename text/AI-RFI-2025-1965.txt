General Comment
If we carve an exem ption from  Copyright law we destroy the incentive for innovation in every area. Today they are taking im ages and
docum ents, but next they will be taking existing software to copy, then they will m ove on to industrial design, and no industry will be willing
to spend the m oney to develop som ething new. Capitalism  isn't just com petition, it's also built on inventors knowing that they can trust
their ideas won't be stolen.
Copyright and Patent laws were created to INCREASE innovation because it encourages people and industry to invent som ething better,
knowing they will be able to m ake a profit from  what they created.
Rem ove that, and you destroy the very thing that has m ade our econom y so great.
