General Comment
Allowing AI to use copyrighted content to train and generate content is a gross violation of copyright law. For what reason should AI be
allowed to m isuse these copyrighted works without com pensation or credit? Will I then, be allowed to use the content derived from  these
AI black boxes without com pensation or credit? AI cannot be perm itted to run ram pant, else it will result in the erosion of artistic and
intellectual integrity, and end in a never ending spiral of copyright litigation.
