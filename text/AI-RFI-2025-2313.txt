General Comment
Am erican dom inance has been in hum an innovation and artistry for hundreds of years. AI will ensure that com es to an end. Generative
ai/m achine learning cannot create or innovate, it only regurgitates what we give it. Asking it to design som ething new will not lead to
breakthroughs or innovation, but a collage of previously written ideas, still leaving the work of m aking it usable to hum ans- better to keep
the concepts hum an as well, since we will need to do the rest of the work anyways. 
Hollywood and Disney are Am erican cultural staples- there's not a country in the world who can ignore that the Am erican m ovie industry
is the best in the world, and allowing AI into that artistic process would destroy it. It's not possible to regurgitate previous content and
produce art. 
Am erican dom inance in AI should stay technical and theoretical, and any plan MUST recognize the contributions of hum an innovation and
protect that strong Am erican core of invention.
