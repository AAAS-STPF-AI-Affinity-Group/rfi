General Comment
I would like to publicly protest against the use of Generative AI tools to censor publishers and creatives that are against the interest of
large tech com panies and individuals, such as Google. This behavior is also illegal and anti-com petitive, and sm aller businesses should be
protected and allowed to operate with intact copyright protections.
