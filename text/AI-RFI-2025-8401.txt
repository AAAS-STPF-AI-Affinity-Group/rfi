Any AI Action Plan m ust respect the rights of copyright holders, and allow them  to determ ine if and when their works can be used to train
AI, icluding what com pensation they will accept in return for granting those rights. Any approach that does not include that protection is a
taking of private property without due process. 
Furtherm ore, environm ental standards regarding use of power and water m ust be set, to ensure that AI data centers do not reduce power
or water available to m eet needs for the general population or existing businesses.
