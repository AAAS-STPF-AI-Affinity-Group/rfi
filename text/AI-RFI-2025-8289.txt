General Comment
I'm  a burgeoning content creator, and even I know that letting "artificial intelligence" scrape data and products from  people is a bad idea.
If it can be ethically done, sure I guess, but laws passed under broad goals like "staying ahead in the AI gam e" is NOT ok. Restrict "AI"s,
"LLM"s, and the like until we have a better grasp of what this technology can do and how it interacts with our existing laws. DO NOT
PASS LAWS UNMOORING IT FROM ETHICS!
