General Comment
"Generative AI" and alm ost all form s of it are sourced from  sources that do not consent to it's use for Gen AI. Gen AI is not
transform ative in nature and is im m oral and downright a breach of creative rights. The Federal Governm ent should refute Gen AI and
restrict it's usage to properly sourced m aterial within they are the progenitor of and such holds the rights to use the m aterial they source.
Any other use of Gen AI is unconstitutional and infringes on copyrights and basic hum an rights. Having an algorithm  use the likeness of
people and creative m aterial without owning said m aterial, buying said rights to the m aterial, or paying the people involved in the creation
of used m aterial, is wrong.
Generative AI should NOT be protected and should be restricted. This Executive order is wrong and should be revoked for the rights of
all Am erican citizens to protect creative freedom  and liberty.
