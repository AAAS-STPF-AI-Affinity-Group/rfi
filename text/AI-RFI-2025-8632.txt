General Comment
I do not believe that generative AI holds a viable future within the United States. It does nothing except steal from  hardworking creatives
of all fields, depriving them  of their livelihoods. This technology is being forced upon our citizens who increasingly do not want it. The use
of generative AI attacks m eritocracy, its use lends itself to frauds and scam s where skills are m isrepresented, taking away opportunities
from  honest workers and creatives. Generative AI cannot be trusted, nor any m aker of these generative AI m odels. How they acquire
data isn't just questionable, it is illegal. They have proven tim e and tim e again that they violate copyright law by taking property that is not
theirs without consent or proper com pensation. Am erica should not support a business m odel that thrives upon ram pant theft. Am erica
should not support a business m odel that encourages fraud. Am erica should stand up for its workers and creatives from  all fields and
reject the encroachm ent from  generative AI com panies.
