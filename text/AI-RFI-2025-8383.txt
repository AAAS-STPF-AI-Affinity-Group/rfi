General Comment
The way m achine learning is being used by corporations right now is reprehensible. Stealing content from  the entire internet, feeding it into
a m achine so it will vom it som ething back up which they hope to sell. These data sets are using STOLEN DATA and this is NOT fair use.
It's corporations trying to bend the rules so they can m ake m oney without paying for hum an labor. And they are not even m aking a profit
from  AI. It will never be profitable because the end results are trash. Com panies like Google are im plem enting AI in their products and
m ake it im possible to turn them  off, which of course gives a false im pression of AI's desirability and success. Som e AI server farm s m ake
m ore m oney getting paid by local governm ents to shut down and stop using so m uch power than they do from  the AI services the server
farm  is for. This is out of control. AI/m achine learning does not need to be outright banned but there need to be very strict laws to control
its use. Research and non-profit only. All data sets m ust be obtained with perm ission from  copyright holders. No public tools for regular
citizens to use for fun or for evil. AI can be used for good, but it is TOO EASY to use it dangerously. Make it harder to access. Nobody
gives a dam n about the USA being the leader in AI technology except CEOs. Don't encourage them . Make them  STOP.
