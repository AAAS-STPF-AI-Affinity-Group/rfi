Mozilla’s Response to the O ﬃce of Science and Technology Policy 
Request for Information on the Development of an Arti ﬁcial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
About Mozilla 
Mozilla’s mission is to ensure the internet is a global public resource, open and accessible 
to all. An internet that truly puts people ﬁrst, where individuals can shape their own 
experience and are empowered, safe, and independent. 
Founded as a community open source project in 1998, Mozilla consists of several 
organizations. Most notable is the non-pro ﬁt Mozilla Foundation and its wholly owned 
subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation, which leads our market-based work, including the 
development of the open-source Firefox web browser and Gecko, one of only three major 
browser engines. They work in close concert with each other and a global community of 
tens of thousands of volunteers under the single banner: Mozilla. 
For the past ﬁve years, Mozilla has been committed to advancing trustworthy AI. Mozilla 
published a paper in early 2024, Accelerating Progress Toward Trustworthy AI, that 
outlines how Mozilla and its allies are advancing openness, competition, and 
accountability in AI. Mozilla is putting its resources behind these priorities as well: Mozilla 
is investing $30M in research and development on trustworthy AI via Mozilla.ai, as well as 
$35M in responsible tech startups — including investments in notable startups like 
Hugging Face — through Mozilla Ventures and the Mozilla Builders accelerator program. 
On the frontlines of modern AI practices, Mozilla freely provides an open-source, 
large-language model (LLM) AI model deployment system for local use and empowers 
more people to enhance the safety of models online through the 0Din bug bounty 
program . In addition, Mozilla supports organizations engaged in arti ﬁcial intelligence 
research, including the Open Source Initiative’s work on deﬁning Open Source AI , and 
through the e ﬀorts of the Columbia Convening which brought together a broad set of 
stakeholders to talk about Openness and AI.

As an independent and mission-driven organization, Mozilla is committed to working with 
regulators to develop e ﬀective policies that ensure that innovation and growth in AI serve 
the public interest. In the past, Mozilla has provided comments on critical topics like the 
Department of Energy’s RFI on the Frontiers in AI for Science, Security, and Technology 
(FASST), NTIA’s consultation on openness in AI models, and NIST’s Request for Comments 
related to Managing Misuse Risk for Dual-Use Foundation Models.  
Executive Summary 
For the future of AI to bene ﬁt all Americans, we must ensure that its bene ﬁts are shared 
widely while working to mitigate evidence-based risks. 
The modern web was founded on the ideal of openness and built on an architecture that 
enabled broad access and participation. However, the open architecture that de ﬁned the 
outset of the web has been eroded, with the internet increasingly dominated by a few big 
platforms and proprietary systems and technologies. At the dawn of the AI age, these 
same dominant tech companies are positioned to hegemonize the next phase of the 
internet by controlling major AI systems. In order to have a dynamic internet economy 
and AI ecosystem that oﬀers real accountability and choice, the principles of the modern 
web – focused on openness, access, and participation – must be protected. The AI era 
cannot be dominated by big tech companies, which could both threaten the pace of 
innovation and run roughshod over individual rights, like privacy. Mozilla has long been a 
proponent of strong federal privacy legislation, and creating clear guidelines and certainty 
for consumers and businesses related to privacy will be critical to enabling the growth of 
the AI industry. 
Well-designed regulation is needed to make AI more trustworthy and to mitigate risk. AI 
policy should center on openness, competition, and accountability as the backbone of 
responsible regulation. Leadership in AI requires investments in the tools and resources 
necessary to build Public AI infrastructure. Well managed government-led or facilitated 
investment into Public AI, including investment into fundamental research and AI 
infrastructure like the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR), can also help to facilitate a 
more level playing ﬁeld, and create choice for consumers and small businesses. 
Promoting open approaches in AI has the potential not just to create technology that 
beneﬁts individuals, but also to make AI systems safer and more transparent. Open 
approaches and public investment can spur increased research and development, create 
2 


products that are more a ﬀordable, safer, and less vulnerable to cyberattacks, and help to 
catalyze investment and job creation.  
To meet America’s goals of leading in AI, policymakers should avoid heavy-handed levers 
like export controls on open-source AI models. Instead, the new administration should 
build on the recommendations of NTIA and the Bipartisan House Task Force Report on AI 
to support the open-source AI ecosystem while continuing to collect information for 
future data-driven assessments. The enactment of broad export controls on open-source 
AI models would stymie innovation and hurt the ability of the U.S. to remain competitive 
in the global AI market. 
Policy Recommendations to Advance American AI 
Increase Government Use of, and Support for, Open-Source AI: The federal government 
procures billions of dollars of software every year. However, much of it is closed-source, 
proprietary, and expensive. If the administration eases the ability to procure and use 
open-source software (ex. via OPM rulemaking) across agencies, it could result in 
signiﬁcant time and cost savings for government IT projects. As federal agencies 
increasingly procure AI-enabled technology, using open-source AI models and software 
will help to increase government e ﬃciency while strengthening the open-source 
ecosystem. Such an approach facilitates the development of a more competitive AI 
ecosystem, unlocking AI for everyone. 
The federal government should also continue to implement policies on government use of 
AI that were signed by President Trump in his ﬁrst term in o ﬃce. That includes 
continuing to implement Executive Order 13960 and the AI in Government Act of 2020, 
the latter which led to OMB Management Memorandum M-24-10 that has key provisions 
on testing AI systems that are vital for trustworthy AI. Continued transparency via the 
annual AI use case inventories, initiated by the ﬁrst Trump Administration, is vital for 
decreasing duplication and increasing coordination in AI across the federal government. 
Develop & Fund Public AI Infrastructure: Public AI infrastructure takes a range of forms, but 
one concrete proposal is the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR). By supporting the 
creation and funding of the NAIRR, Congress and the administration could kickstart the 
development of Public AI, giving researchers and smaller universities access to AI tools and compute resources, enabling innovation and a more level playing ﬁeld. In addition,

AI training and use. By collecting adequate data on AI resource demands, industry can 
better prepare and invest in new energy and related infrastructure, helping to expedite the 
rollout of new infrastructure and keeping America at the bleeding edge of AI development. 
Clarify the Federal Position on Open-Source AI Export Controls: In their July 2024 report 
related to the use of open models, NTIA emphasized that based on the data available today, 
the government should take no current action to restrict open foundation models. 
However, discussions linger over the use of export controls to limit the dissemination of 
open AI models. This creates uncertainty for the open-source community, technical 
researchers driving progress in AI, and the many startups that leverage such software to 
bring products to market cheaper and faster than large tech companies. By aﬃrming a 
federal position on open-source AI export controls to re ﬂect those of NTIA, and 
emphasizing the bene ﬁts of open models, the administration can spur further 
advancement in the ﬁeld. This will in turn help advance national objectives as American 
open-source powered AI exports spread around the world. It may also prevent vendor 
lock-in for AI deployers and drive supplier diversity, including in the national security 
context. This is a view echoed broadly by industry decision makers: in the February 2025 
McKinsey report, which was created as part of a research collaboration with the Mozilla 
Foundation and the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, “Open source in the age of AI,” “60 
percent of decision makers reported lower implementation costs with open source AI 
compared with similar proprietary tools.” The report went on to say that “Overall, 76 
percent of respondents expected their organization to increase use of open source AI 
technologies over the next several years. This may be in part because open source has been 
part of a vibrant software ecosystem in many categories of enterprise software, as well as 
a foundational resource for developer communities, for decades.” 
Growing the AI Talent Ecosystem: Without leading experts and practitioners in AI, America 
will face grave di ﬃculties competing with larger countries and coalitions which may have 
a numerical advantage in the number of researchers and computer scientists they 
produce. America must invest in community colleges, rural and public universities, 
apprenticeship and retraining programs, and beyond to develop and grow the domestic AI 
talent ecosystem. This will not only help America compete, but provide pathways to good 
jobs and advance the goal of creating AI that will not replace humans as elucidated by Vice 
President Vance at the 2025 Paris AI Action Summit. The administration should look to 
examples of innovative partnerships between the public and private sector that create 
5 


unique education pathways and a pipeline of qualiﬁed workers like Dakota State 
University’s partnership with ArmyCyber. 
Conclusion
Ensuring that AI development remains open, competitive, and accountable is crucial for 
fostering innovation and safeguarding public interests. As an organization that both 
builds AI products and advocates for policies that promote trustworthy AI, we believe that 
it is critical to create policies that emphasize government support for open-source AI, 
investment in public AI infrastructure, and the establishment of clear regulatory 
frameworks that enhance transparency while preventing monopolistic control. By taking a 
leadership role in global AI standards, supporting AI talent development, and addressing 
energy consumption concerns, the U.S. can create a competitive and innovative AI 
ecosystem. We look forward to working with you and appreciate the willingness to consult 
with the broader public on the administration’s developing strategy on AI.
