General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. It steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. It is an
overhyped, gross m isuse of technological advances and Am erican resources that will only serve to harm  and take away em ploym ent
opportunities from  the working m en and wom en of this country.
