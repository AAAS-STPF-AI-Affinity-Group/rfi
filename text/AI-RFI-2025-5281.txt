General Comment
Hey. 
Iâ€™m  part of a com m unity of creatives, and this nonsense has been absolutely devastating to them . This technology takes an insane am ount
of resources to run, plagiarizes current creative works, and generates trash. There is no net benefit to it.
This technology is incredibly dam aging, rips off honest creatives, and has zero place in the future of the United States.
