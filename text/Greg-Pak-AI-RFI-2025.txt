To Whom It May Concern,
I am a writer, filmmaker, and photographer.
So-called "A.i." technologies like ChatGPT and Dall-E are based on the automated, mass theft of my work and the  
work of millions of creators like me.
So-called "A.i." text technologies like ChatGPT constantly present false information as fact, spreading dangerous  
ignorance and disinformation.
So-called "A.i." technologies like Dall-E enable the creation of fake imagery that can spread dangerous political  
disinformation.
So-called "A.i." technologies like ChatGPT consume massive amounts of energy and water and endanger the  
environment.
My conclusion is that the current implementation of these technologies is immoral, unethical, and dangerous and  
violates copyright law. These technologies should not be encouraged, aided, used, or subsidized by the government  
in any way.
One very specific suggestion is that a so-called "A.i." company should be required to obtain the permission of every  
single creator for every single work it wants to use before it uses it, and the company should be required to  
immediately remove all work for which it lacks such permission from its databases.
Thank you for your attention.
Greg Pak
