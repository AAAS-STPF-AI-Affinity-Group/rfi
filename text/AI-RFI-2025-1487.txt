General Comment
While the pursuit of technological advancem ent through encouraging an incubation environm ent for the next great technologies is a noble
pursuit. AI "m odels" such as Chat GPT by OPEN AI is not the way to go. AI m odels have been around for som e tim e, developed using
existing technologies, while utilizing a Com pany's datasets for their m odels to develop products, forecasts, and patented algorithm s all in
house. 
What OPEN AI is doing am ounts to IP and Copyright theft the likes of which hasn't been seen before at this scale. These m odels are
created by scraping the entire internet. Any com pany that has uploaded anything to the internet is fair gam e to them , unless you've been
added to a restriction list due to on going lawsuits.
Becom ing the cradle for AI advancem ent in the US is appreciated. To advance the technology to be faster, m ore efficient would be
welcom ed. However guardrails and basic rules are needed so that other industries do not suffer. A rising tide raises all boats and what is
proposed only floods them .
