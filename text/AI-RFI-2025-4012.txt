General Comment
The term  "AI", as its currently used, is little m ore than a search engine. The training data is fed into a large probabilistic m odel that free
associates words together.
These tools have little, if any, value. They frequently "hallucinate" due to their probabilistic design. They have no notion of truth or
accuracy. Their only value is to create a list of words that approxim ate a sentence to the reader.
That said, what they're good at is regurgitating the input that they receive. This input is the real contributions of hum an effort. The
allowance of fair use to their training on copyrighted m aterial is an affront to the hum an effort used to create what they receive.
Furtherm ore, what we're seeing in the m arket has the classic signatures of a speculative bubble. The "AI war" is nothing m ore than a
com petition between the hucksters vying for suprem acy in the eyes of the investors. The only way to win is not to play the gam e.
I do not support changing copyright law to favor AI use. And I do not support assigning copyright protection to the output of AI m odels.
This is a flawed business that shouldn't be allowed to exist.
