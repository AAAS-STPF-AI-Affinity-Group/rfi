General Comment
I find that this is an exploitation of copyrighted m aterial that will be abused heavily if im plem ented. To im plem ent this would require a
HUGE am ount of energy and resources for very little return from  stolen sources. Not only that, he would m akes us beholden to a few tech
com panies that would never have the interest of the technology any m ore efficient than it can ever be.
I also find that generative AI has had m ore than enough tim e and data already scraped from  sources to show that it is far to unreliable in
any instance for any decision and knowledge that requires expertise, experience, and accountability.
