General Comment
I do NOT support giving AI access to works, no m atter what form at, created by others. This is called theft. AI is NOT wanted by
everyone, only a few billionaires who seek to profit off the work of others in the hopes we creatives will becom e unneeded. To allow AI
unrestricted access to our blood sweat and tears would be the biggest form  of betrayal.
