General Comment
If the governm ent is going to forgo enforcing copyright laws to benefit the developm ent of artificial intelligence, then the governm ent should
ensure said artificial intelligence is available to all taxpayers. Granting private-sector artificial intelligence com panies im m unity from
copyright and other obligations while not requiring a reciprocal grant of intellectual property am ounts to a welfare program  funded by
taxpayers to help artificial intelligence com panies replace their jobs quicker.
