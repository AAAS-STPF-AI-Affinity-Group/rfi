General Comment
As an artist, I work hard to put m y best into the works I create for m yself and other involved parties. My art is apart of m e and I'd feel
violated if com panies could take what I've m ade without m y written consent and use it to train a horrible bog of AI. Please don't allow this
to go forward.
