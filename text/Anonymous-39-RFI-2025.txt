Ai needs to be regulated to protect personal information and digital property, prevent mining on 
personal devices/sites, theft of copyright work, and prevent reputation damage from fake images, 
videos, and documents. Ai being used to help with medicine and  science, which is a great Ai to 
invest in but there still needs to be a knowledgeable human on the other side that can confirm the 
Ai's results. Not us just blinding accepting the computer's answer, when it could have been fed 
the wrong during its mining.  We need laws protecting people and go after companies that create 
forged documents made by Ai, use image generators to make porn of real people, and protect 
jobs. Ai should be seen as a tool, not as a worker replacement. If an Ai gives customers incorrect  
answers, there should be someone on site to correct the information. If the Ai gives customers 
incorrect information that gets them injured or killed, there should be laws holding that company 
accountable for not properly testing their Ai and not checking  the info they feed to the Ai
