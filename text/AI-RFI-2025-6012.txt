General Comment
I strongly believe that AI has not achieved a level of usefulness to warrant allowing it to bypass copyright. No creator will feel m otivated
to create if all their works could be stolen and profited from  by som eone else. At worst it is a tool used against us, and at best it's
overhyped. Please stop this.
