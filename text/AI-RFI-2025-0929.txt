General Comment
I agree that as a m atter of national security and the nation's econom ic security that the U.S. needs to be at the forefront of innovations and
the protection of those innovations. Adm ittedly, AI is a beast that will be hard to control and m uch like our republic only viable when
m oral people are at the helm . Who can guarantee that LLMs will be unbiased? Who are the gatekeepers of this inform ation? Never
underestim ate the laziness of governm ent, com m erce, and individuals. 
I am  concerned about the displacem ent of hum anity. Both m y sons are currently in college, and we already their future job opportunities
potentially being replaced with advances in technology and AI. The future does not look bright at all for som e individuals. I know that this
is not som ething that can be legislated, per se, but it certainly needs to be taken into consideration. I know I sound like a farrier at the
advent of autom obiles. 
Good luck and I pray for enlightenm ent on this m atter.
