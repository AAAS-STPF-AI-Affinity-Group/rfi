General Comment
There is a responsible way to use generative technology by crediting contributors, paying for data and copyrighted works. There is also an
irresponsible way: stealing that sam e hard work, ignoring precedence of copyrighted protections, and profiting from  it without paying what
is rightfully due to creators. 
We m ust protect creators, uphold copyright, and stim ulate the econom y for all with the appropriate com pensation for contribution. It is the
only fair and correct way to do this - they only Am erican way.
