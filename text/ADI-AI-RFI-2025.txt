Subject: Response to Request for Information on the AI Action Plan  
Dear OSTP and NITRD NCO,  
The Alliance for Digital Innovation (ADI) appreciates the opportunity to provide input on the 
development of the AI Action Plan, as directed by Executive Order 14179, Removing Barriers to 
American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence . ADI is a non -partisan alliance that advocates for 
the removal of institutional and bureaucratic barriers to the operation of a modern digital 
government. Our members provide key critical technologies to the federal government, including 
cloud infrastruct ure, digital identity solutions, human resources software, quantum computing, 
digital services, and a range of sophisticated cybersecurity tools and services. We support the 
adoption of innovative commercial technologies by the Federal Government.  
ADI offers the following recommendations to sustain and enhance America's AI leadership.  
1. Implement a Risk -Based Approach to AI Governance
Effective AI governance should focus on the specific risks associated with various AI 
applications  from development through deployment . ADI advocates for a framework that:  
●Identifies High -Risk AI Applications:  Concentrate regulatory efforts on AI systems that
have a significant legal or safety impact on individuals , thereby avoiding unnecessary
constraints on low -risk, enterprise -level AI uses, such as cybersecurity measures.
●Exempts Routine Enterprise Functions:  Explicitly exclude AI applications in
cybersecurity, network management, software development on low -risk environments,
and data storage from high -risk classifications to ensure these critical functions remain
agile and effective.
2. Enhance AI Procurement Processes
To promote the integration of advanced AI technologies in government operations, procurement 
processes should be modernized to:  


2 ●Increase Micro -Purchase and Simplified Acquisition Thresholds:  Raising these
thresholds enables agencies to swiftly acquire innovative AI solutions, fostering a more
competitive and flexible procurement environment.
●Encourage Engagement with Emerging Tech Providers:  Simplifying procurement
procedures allows smaller, innovative companies to contribute AI solutions, enriching the
government's technological capabilities.
3. Prioritize AI in Cybersecurity
AI plays a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity across government networks. Policies should:  
●Support AI -Driven Cyber Defense Mechanisms:  Utilize AI to monitor and defend
information networks, providing real -time visibility and rapid incident response to protect
against sophisticated cyber threats.  Additionally, the administration should prioritize
investment in technology that will defend against next -generation cyber -attacks,
including sophisticated attacks powered by generative AI.
●Adopt Security -Forward Postures:  Implement use -case -specific policies  that impose
appropriate requirements on developers and deployers of high -risk AI systems, while
exempting routine enterprise IT functions from unnecessary constraints.
4. Work with Industry to Build Security into AI
As AI is consumed by government departments and agencies, the administration should work 
with industry to build security into AI technology adopted and utilized across government  
networks. Policies should:  
●Work with Industry on Standards and Best Practices : As the United States continues
to lead the way on AI development and adoption, the administration should work with
industry to develop and implement  secure practices for AI technology. Additionally, the
administration should leverage existing compliance mechanisms to drive the adoption  of
those practices across AI technology used by departments and agencies .
●Drive Standards Adoption : The administration should lead the discussion on adoption
of common security practices for AI technology . The administration can leverage the
work of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to underpin industry -led
security best practices and associated compliance mechanisms  to ensure a more
resilient AI ecosystem .
5. Foster Collaboration Between Government and Industry
A robust partnership between the public and private sectors is essential for AI advancement. To 
strengthen this collaboration:  
●Establish Public -Private Partnerships:  Create initiatives that bring together
government agencies and industry leaders to co -develop AI solutions addressing
national challenges.


3 ●Facilitate Knowledge Exchange:  Organize forums and workshops where government
and industry stakeholders can share best practices, emerging trends, and lessons
learned in AI adoption .
6. Invest in AI Workforce Development
Building a skilled workforce is critical to sustaining AI leadership. Efforts should include:  
●Educational Programs and Training:  Develop curricula and certification programs to
equip current and future workers with AI competencies  and hands -on experiences .
●Reskilling and Upskilling Initiatives:  Provide opportunities for existing employees to
acquire AI -related skills, ensuring they can adapt to technological advancements.
7. Invest in Good Government Data Practices
Government agencies have robust repositories of primary data stores that can power and 
underpin AI models that governments to use to deliver services to citizens and deliver efficient 
mission outcomes. Government efforts should include : 
●Policies that drive good data practices : Agencies should review their primary data to
make sure the data sets are clean, organized, appropriately tagged and marked, and
formatted for digital use . This includes migrating paper -based data stores to digital
formats. Congress should consider updating or amending the Federal Data Strategy and
Evidence Acts to include AI considerations around data management.
●Programs that leverage government data : As agencies adopt commercial, cloud -
based  AI technology, agency leaders should prioritize leveraging existing government
data to train government AI models to ensure effective and efficient service and mission
delivery. Government can develop standard service level agreements that ensure
appropriate privacy and security protections for both primary and derived data.
Conclusion  
By adopting a risk -based approach to AI governance, modernizing procurement processes, 
prioritizing AI in cybersecurity, fostering public -private collaboration, and investing in workforce 
development, the United States can reinforce its position as a global leader in artificial 
intelligence. ADI stands ready to support these efforts and collaborate with policymakers to 
achieve these objectives.  
The Alliance for Digital Innovation appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments for 
your consideration. As OSTP continues to develop policies and strategies to ensure the 
responsible procurement of AI by federal agencies, ADI stands ready to provi de any additional 
insight or feedback. Thank you again for the opportunity to engage on such an important topic.  
Sincerely,
