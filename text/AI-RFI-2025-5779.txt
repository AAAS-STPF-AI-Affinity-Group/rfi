General Comment
“AI” is nothing but overhyped data stealing software. It’s nowhere near as useful or profitable as we’ve been m ade to believe and can’t
even function without ripping off hum an artists, writers, and content creators. And on top of all that, its dam aging to the environm ent due
to the vast am ounts of water and electricity needed to power/cool data centers. If anything there should be a lot m ore regulations
surrounding the developm ent of AI technologies, not less.
