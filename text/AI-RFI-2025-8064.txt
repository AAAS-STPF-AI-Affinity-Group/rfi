General Comment
The entire edifice of AI as currently practiced is an end-run around the legitim acy of copyright law for no valid reason. There is no excuse
for prioritizing "AI innovation" at the expense of copyright, to pretend otherwise is to privilege large com panies' right to push around
sm aller com panies and individuals to gain m arket share. No valid reason for this has ever been offered because there is none. If AI cannot
operate within the bounds of copyright law and fair use it does not deserve to operate, and private sector AI innovation has no right to
play by a different set of laws than the rest of us. Any different approach is an unfair handout to large tech businesses at the expense of the
rest of us and underm ines the intellectual property that has been bought with the sweat of its owners' brows. The predatory rhetoric of AI
com panies is an em barassm ent born of their inability to succeed if they m ust play by the rules. Despite the hype it rem ains deeply unclear if
AI has the broad future its inventors claim , as every non-narrow usage proffered to date has annoyed consum ers to no real benefit, and
there is no obvious broad use case for generative technology with no notion of correctness. Do not let AI play by its own rules, the rules
we have are perfectly good and the liars pushing AI don't deserve special ones just because their technology isn't good enough to stand on
its own feet without cheating.
