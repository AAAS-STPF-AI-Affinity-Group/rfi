General Comment
I am  against the m ass scraping of works for the use of training generative AI and believe it would harm  m ore Am ericans than it would
help, especially sm all businesses and artists who rely on copyright to protect their work and intellectual property. To allow training to go
unfettered without any com pensation to those whose works have been stolen in order to directly com pete with them  would render
copyright com pletely useless and destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs. Generative AI has already done irreparable harm  to m any
creative industries, and especially now during a recession, jobs are needed m ore than ever.
Copyright SHOULD give us the ability to say no, to opt out of the use of our works without perm ission.
