General Comment
AI is a terrible tool by few for fewer- It has no place in Am erica, nor anywhere in the world. It not only poses huge security risks (So why
on earth do these fools claim  its developm ent is in the interest of national security- well, obviously, m oney), but is m assively expensive to
m aintain and is detrim ental to the econom y. AI is trained on the work of skilled Am ericans by untalented people who do not care about
the consequences it will bring.
