General Comment
GenAI is a fraud perpetrated on the public. It depends utterly on stolen intellectual property and m ore energy than we can responsibly
generate. It is called "AI" because that sounds good, but it is not artificial intelligence. It is an im precise regurgitator of scraped content
designed to im press and bam boozle. Ultim ately, this hoax is intended to threaten and control labor.
If OpenAI is failing because it cannot steal copyrights, it should fail. This is transparently obvious. This is how our econom y is supposed to
work. Thieves are not given a pass because they stole successfully.
We see what is happening.
