Granting OpenAI and other AI companies immunity from lawsuits due to copyright
infringement defeats the intention of copyright to give people an incentive to create byensuring that they receive compensation for use of their work. If an AI company can resellyour work so long as they launder it by first feeding it into a
  "generative model" and then
regurgitate it as output, then that incentive to create will be greatly diminished.
