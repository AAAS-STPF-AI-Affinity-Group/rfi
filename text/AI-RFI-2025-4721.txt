General Comment
I do not believe that AI has a place in the future of the USA. AI steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans, m yself included, and profits from
that theft. If we choose to rely on AI, we choose to cripple ourselves.
Copyright m ust stand firm  against the use of AI; original creators should be consulted before their works are fed to AI, and if they choose
to consent to their works being used then they should be com pensated thereafter.
