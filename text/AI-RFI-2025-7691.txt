General Comment
As an independent artist I find it abhorrent that these corporations are aim ing to profit off of huge swaths of copyrighted work without
oversight. If independent m usicians canâ€™t so m uch as sam ple other m usicians work without appropriately asking for perm ission, it m akes
no sense to m e that these com panies should be allowed to use others works to power their products on such a huge scale. Please do not
allow these com panies and their lobbying to steal from  sm all creatives.
