General Comment
Artificial intelligence threatens to both optim ize workflows and reinforce injustice - It is trained without consent from  the producers of
content, jeopardizing both copyright law and the average person's side hustles. It is trusted to m ake life-altering decisions, but both
reinforces biases and frequently m akes m istakes. What's m ore, it cannot be tasked with explaining its justifications, leading to a situation
where hum ans rely on an unreliable black box to spit out results which are unpredictable, and often, entirely hallucinated by large language
m odels. Am ericans cannot trust artificial intelligence without a m eans of culpability by its creators to source their data ethically, as well as
to produce results that can be traced back to an culpable party, say if m edical coverage is denied, lives are lost, or Am erican's well-being
is m eaningfully affected.
