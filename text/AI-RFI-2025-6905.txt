General Comment
I do not believe generative AI will help hum ans flourish. Training AI on copyrighted m aterials is stealing and a gross violation of
personhood. Regulation and laws m ust be enacted to restrict the private sector's ability to rob and siphon other individuals intellectual
property. Art is an expression of hum anity, and som ething as heartless and soulless as AI should never be allowed to infringe this
countryâ€™s culture. It is self-sabotage, im m oral, and a m utilation of hum an heritage.
