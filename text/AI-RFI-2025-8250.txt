General Comment
Majority, if not all, nations have laws in place against theft. Typically these laws punish those who would steal, whether the theft be in the
form  of m aterial objects, data, or intellectual property. Generative AI requires theft of works created by others, both individuals and
collectives, in order to function. Unless the com pany can gain perm ission for use or rightfully com pensate the individuals behind the
m aterial intended for training, that is theft, plain and sim ple. And why lim it the theft to works created by the public? If Generative AI uses
intellectual properties belonging to m ajor com panies is that also ok? Is a com pany using Generative AI “trains” their m odel on patented
inform ation, should that not open the com pany up to lawsuits for theft of intellectual property? Or does the definition change because it
targets the property of a larger organization which m ost likely uses that property to m ake m oney. In short, if Generative AI can be used to
steal property from  the people than it m ust also be able to steal property from  corporations and use that data as it so pleases, even if it
m ay decrease profits for said corporation and take business from  it. Each individual m ust have ownership of that which they create.
