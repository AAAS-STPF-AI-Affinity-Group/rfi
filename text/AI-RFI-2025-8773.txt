General Comment
I have no faith in the prom ise of AI's utility. The livelihoods of creators currently rely on the legal protections that enable their work. The
utility of AI, which is worth less than the sum  of its parts, cannot eclipse the value of artists because AI is built upon the theft of those
artists' work. AI is a cruel m eans to artificially devaluing the work of an industry while intentionally m isunderstanding its purpose; AI's
venality hurts the livelihoods of the artists whose work is stolen and, without thought or awareness of the popular discom fort with AI's
unattractive handiwork, puts the developm ent of m edia into the hands of am orphous, venal, and unreliable AI apparatuses. AI is valued
only as m uch as the work of artists is wanted to be supplied without artists' consent, the appropriation of com pensation to artists, or so
m uch as acknowledgem ent of artists. Protection of artists and writers' work is protection of their livelihoods and the reliability of
inform ation published everywhere.
