AIAI Fully Supports President Trump’s AI Initiative and VP Vance’s Vision for AI 
Leadership  
The American Institute of Artificial Intelligence (AIAI)  welcomes President Trump’s new AI 
initiative  and Vice President Vance’s stated position at the Paris AI Action Summit . AIAI has long 
advocated for a strategic, dominance -driven AI policy , making it the only AI institute that has 
consistently maintained the same position as now undertaken by the administration  - since 2020 . 
President Trump’s Executive Order 14179 , issued on January 23, 2025 , affirms that:  “It is the 
policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’ s global dominance in order to promote 
human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.”  
As the only AI institute to have consistently championed this position since 2020 , AIAI stands 
ready to support, advise, and help implement  the administration’s AI policies to ensure that AI 
remains a driver of American strength, security, and global competitiveness . The United States 
cannot afford to fall behind  in AI development and deployment  - dominance is not optional; it is 
necessary . 
This directive aligns with AIAI’s longstanding position  - that AI is not just an industry or a 
technological advancement, but a foundational force that will define national power, economic 
strength, and geopolitical influence  in the coming decades. AI leadership is synonymous with 
global leadership , and securing American supremacy in AI is imperative  for both national security 
and economic prosperity.  March 15th, 2025

Vice President J.D. Vance  further reinforced this vision at the Paris AI Action Summit , stating the 
need to maintain American leadership in AI  and use AI to: “Make people more productive, more 
prosperous, and more free.”  
AIAI has long argued that AI should be viewed as a force multiplier  - one that enhances human 
potential, fuels economic growth, and fortifies national security . However, maintaining American 
AI leadership requires more than just investment  - it demands a clear, aggressive, and coordinated 
national strategy  that integrates AI across defense, industry, and governance . 
AIAI has long been concerned about the state of American AI strategy  and its 
implications  
The American Institute of Artificial Intelligence (AIAI)  has long been concerned about the state of 
American AI strategy  and its implications for national security, economic competitiveness, and 
global leadership. Despite early leadership in AI research, the United States has failed to develop 
a comprehensive, systematic approach to AI deployment and adoption . In contrast, China has 
executed a highly coordinated and deliberate AI strategy , resulting in faster AI scaling, greater 
national integration, and broader economic and security advantages.  
The Divergent Paths of AI Development: United States vs. China  
AIAI’s research has highlighted fundamental differences  between how the U.S. and China 
introduced and integrated AI into their national frameworks. These differences have contributed 
to America’s relative decline  in AI capabilities  while China continues to make strategic advances .

The Strategic Shortcomings  of the United States  AI Plans : Insights from AIAI's Research  
AIAI has analyzed previous U.S. AI strategic plans and national AI initiatives  and has found them 
to be deeply underdeveloped . While American AI research remains strong, the failure to implement 
a unified, scalable, and strategically aligned AI deployment model has led to stagnation and 
inefficiency . As a result:  
1.China has outpaced the U.S. in AI scaling and integration  – leveraging AI for economic
growth, surveillance, military applications, and governance.
2.U.S. AI initiatives remain fragmented  – with no overarching national AI doctrine  that
connects military, industry, and public -sector AI adoption.
3.Declining AI capabilities threaten broader national achievements  – including economic
competitiveness, military strength, and global technological leadership.
Dr. Al Naqvi, CEO of AIAI , along with Intel’s Mani Jankiram , highlighted these failures in their 
book, At the Speed of Irrelevance: How America Blew Its AI Leadership Position and How to 
Regain It . The book provides a strategic analysis of the flaws in America’s AI trajectory , urging an 
immediate recalibration of U.S. AI policy  to prevent further erosion of national capabilities.  
AIAI has consistently warned that if the U.S. does not rectify its AI strategy, the decline in AI 
capabilities will have cascading effects on every aspect of national achievement . AI is not an 
isolated field  - it is the backbone of modern economic, military, and geopolitical power . Without a 
decisive national AI strategy, the U.S. risks:  
•Losing technological supremacy  to China and other adversaries.


4 | P a g e
•Weakening military and defense capabilities , as AI -enabled autonomous systems,
cybersecurity, and electronic warfare capabilities fall behind.
•Falling behind in economic growth , as AI -powered industries dominate global markets.
•Failing to influence global AI governance , allowing authoritarian regimes to set AI norms
and ethics.
The window for the United States to reassert its AI leadership is closing rapidly . China’s rapid AI 
progress is not accidental  - it is the result of deliberate, structured, and long -term planning . If the 
U.S. does not adopt a similarly strategic and systemic approach , it risks not only technological 
stagnation  but also a decline in global influence and national security . 
Typical AI National Plans  Will Fail Without True Strategic Orientation  
As AI reshapes global power, nearly every nation has drafted an AI strategy. However, these plans 
often follow a predictable, ineffective pattern , offering aspirational rhetoric rather than operational 
execution . They frame AI as both an opportunity and a threat , yet spend more time on ethics and 
regulation  than on concrete deployment frameworks . While responsible AI is essential, 
overemphasizing governance without a strategy for dominance leads to stagnation . 
Most AI strategies focus on data accessibility, research funding, workforce training, and business 
incentives . While these elements are important, they often lack integration into national security, 
economic, and industrial policies . Governments pour money into AI research and startups, yet fail 
to embed AI into critical infrastructure, defense, and intelligence operations . Training programs, 
though necessary, often do not align with real -world AI adoption, leading to a workforce without 
clear industry path ways . 
Public -private collaboration is another common theme, yet these partnerships rarely have 
structured execution models . Similarly, AI adoption in government tends to focus on bureaucratic 
automation rather than national security applications . Instead of leveraging AI for military defense, 
intelligence operations, and geopolitical influence , governments emphasize administrative 
efficiency  - missing AI’s true potential . 
Beyond these structural weaknesses, many AI strategies lack depth and clarity . In some cases, they 
are driven by political pressure rather than technological necessity . Governments use high-profile 
AI projects as status symbols , showcasing robotics and entertainment AI  instead of building real 
capability in economic, military, and strategic domains . This performative approach  does not lead 
to AI leadership  - it leads to dependency on nations that take AI seriously.  
What True AI Leadership Requires  ________________________  SECTION 3 ________________________  


5 | P a g e
To lead in AI, nations must go beyond fragmented strategies and take a bold, integrated approach : 
•AI must be embedded into economic, military, and political power structures  - not treated
as a niche research initiative.
•AI investment must extend beyond research grants and startup funding to full -scale
national deployment.
•National security and intelligence must integrate AI -driven defense, cybersecurity, and
intelligence operations.
•Economic strategy must prioritize AI -driven supply chains, manufacturing, and industry -
wide transformation.
•Governments must shift from funding discussions to execution roadmaps, ensuring AI
adoption at scale.
AI is not just another technology  - it is the defining force of global competition . Nations that embed 
AI into their strategic foundations will dominate , while those that treat it as a policy discussion 
will fall behind. AI leadership will not be won through ethics frameworks or research funding 
alone  - it will be won through execution.  
Action 1: Develop Proper Strategic Orientation  
A strategy is not a statement of intent  or a collection of tasks arranged in a predictable cause -and-
effect sequence . It requires clarity of purpose, alignment with objectives, and a deep understanding 
of the forces shaping outcomes . The failure to distinguish between policy and strategy  results in 
weak planning, and when strategic thinking does not match national objectives , frameworks 
become aspirational rather than actionable.  
Nowhere is this more evident than in AI, which represents not just a technological shift but a 
fundamental transformation  in how humans think, generate knowledge, and perform work . 
Knowledge production is critical to overcoming survival challenges, as demonstrated by the 
COVID -19 pandemic. Nations with structured biomedical research frameworks  developed 
vaccines swiftly, while those without such infrastructure remained dependent on external solutions. 
Strategic thinking identifies gaps in knowledge , but sol utions emerge only when a systematic 
process of discovery follows . 
AI enhances and accelerates each step  in this process  - expanding strategic thinking, 
revolutionizing knowledge production, and transforming work output . AI enables multi -
dimensional exploration , uncovering solutions beyond human cognitive limits . It also decouples 
discovery from traditional scientific methods , allowing breakthroughs where answers emerge ________________________  SECTION 4 ________________________  


6 | P a g e
before theories are fully understood . This redefines knowledge creation and productivity , far 
beyond what conventional research methods can achieve.  
Beyond discovery, AI is driving exponential productivity gains  through automation in both digital 
and physical environments . It is not just accelerating work  - it is redefining what work is . 
Therefore, an AI strategy cannot be limited to research funding or policy directives ; it must 
orchestrate a transformation  across strategic thinking, knowledge production, and work execution  
to ensure an order -of-magnitude leap in productivity and national capability . 
The goal is not incremental improvement but radical reinvention . Nations that fail to embed AI 
into how they think, create knowledge, and produce value  will struggle to compete in the next era 
of global power . 
Action 2: Build the Context  
The United States faces unprecedented domestic and international challenges. Global power 
dynamics are shifting, with emerging rivals challenging the U.S. -led world order. Major wars in 
Europe and West Asia, economic instability, climate change, trade wars , and supply chain 
disruptions are straining national resilience. At home, political instability, economic inequality, 
and the rise of transnational criminal networks add further complexity. In this volatile landscape, 
AI is not just another technological development  - it is a force that will alter every dimension of 
global power.  
AI is accelerating complexity on an unprecedented scale. The global system is already intricate, 
shaped by trade, diplomacy, and technological competition. The introduction of AI adds intelligent, 
non-human decision -makers  into this system, fundamentally altering the nature of interactions. 
The speed, scale, and cognitive makeup of these AI -driven entities differ vastly from human actors, 
forcing nations to rethink traditional strategy. This is not a challenge that can be a ddressed with 
conventional militar y doctrines or standard economic policies. AI introduces variables never 
before encountered in strategy development , requiring a radical shift in national planning.  
Unlike traditional grand strategies, AI strategy does not merely refine existing approaches  - it 
transforms them. AI disrupts the foundations of knowledge, dramatically expands thinking power, 
and unlocks exponential productivity gains through automation. This is not an incremental shift; 
it is a fundamental restructuring of power dynamics, economi c systems, and cognitive frameworks. 
The challenge is not just to integrate AI into existing strategies but to build entirely new strategic 
models that account for AI’s capacity to redefine the rules of engagement . 
Given AI’s transformative nature, national strategy must move beyond tactical planning. AI is not 
just another instrument of national power  - it amplifies all existing instruments of power  and 
creates entirely new ones. Economic influence, military capabilities, political leverage, and 


7 | P a g e
cultural soft power are all subject to AI -driven magnification. A nation with weak technological 
infrastructure can use AI to revolutionize its industries, just as an underdeveloped entertainment 
sector can be supercharged into a global influence tool. AI does not just enhance existing power  - 
it redefines what power means . 
This shift introduces an extraordinary level of complexity. Power is no longer static or confined to 
traditional domains; it is fluid, scalable, and interdependent. AI allows for synchronization and 
integration of national strengths in ways previously unim aginable. Nations that fail to recognize 
this will remain trapped in outdated strategic models, unable to compete in an AI -dominated world. 
The challenge is not simply to use AI but to embed it into every aspect of national power in a 
synchronized, scalabl e, and integrated manner . 
This is the essence of AI strategy. It is not a funding initiative or an isolated technological effort  - 
it is the most comprehensive and consequential strategic undertaking in modern history . Nations 
that fail to grasp this reality will find themselves at the mercy of those that do.  
Action 3: Not just Adopt, We Must Embed AI  
A crucial distinction in AI strategy is the difference between adoption  and embedding . Adoption 
refers to the successful implementation and utilization of AI  in a way that is accepted and 
integrated with minimal resistance. It ensures AI is effectively used across sectors, but it does not 
inherently alter the fundamental structure of national power. Embedding AI, on the other hand, is 
a far deeper process  - a structured, research -driven approach that determines how AI can amplify 
and integrate instruments of national power , both by enhancing existing capabilities and 
discovering entirely new ones.  
Embedding AI requires a comprehensive evaluation of how AI can transform national strengths , 
ensuring that AI not only enhances power but also synchronizes various instruments  - military, 
economic, social, political, informational, and psychological  - into a unified strategic force. This 
is not a simple process, as AI itself is evolving rapidly. The shift from classical machine learning 
to deep learning, the emergence of transformer architectures, and the explosion of generative AI 
are reshaping both the possibilities and methodologies of AI deployment . This constant evolution 
means that AI strategy must remain agile and adaptable , addressing not only what AI can do, but 
how it is implemented and integrated over time . 
Building upon the def inition of strategy as defined by Department of Defense and captured in the 
Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States, Joint Publication 1, from 2017, Page I -7 JP1 , 
we define AI Strategy  as: 


8 | P a g e
AI strategy is a set of prudent ideas for deploying, discovering, embedding, and 
adopting AI to amplify and augment the overall effect of the instruments of national 
power in a synchronized and integrated fashion, to achieve theater, national, and/or 
multi national objectives.  
This definition reflects AI’s role not as an isolated tool but as a force multiplier  - one that enhances 
decision -making, accelerates knowledge production, and revolutionizes work output across all 
domains of national power. Nations that successfully embed AI as an integral force across all 
instruments of power  will not only maintain their strategic advantage but also redefine the very 
nature of power itself in the AI era.  
Action 4: Clarify Objectives and Competition  
An AI strategy must aim to achieve theater, national, and multinational objectives  within a 
competitive environment  where national interests clash with adversarial forces . AI is not just a tool 
for advancing national power  - it is also a means to diminish adversaries’ power , thereby increasing 
the relative power differential . 
Many AI strategies fail by focusing solely on domestic advancements  while ignoring the need to 
counter external threats . AI is a zero-sum game in key strategic areas , where gains for one nation 
often come at the expense of another . The U.S. restrictions on China’s access to Nvidia AI chips  
illustrate this reality  - China's AI development depends on advanced semiconductors, and limiting 
access deliberately slows its progress . Similarly, U.S. concerns over TikTok’s data access  highlight 
how AI -driven platforms can influence public opinion, shape societal trends, and manipulate 
economic and political forces . AI is not just about efficiency  - it is a battleground for strategic 
influence . 
Competition, however, is not limited to foreign threats . Domestic challenges  - cultural inertia, 
political resistance, and bureaucratic inefficiencies  - can hinder AI adoption. Adversarial actors 
can exploit these divisions , using AI to engineer opposition, disrupt adoption, or fuel political 
instability . A successful AI strategy must address both external and internal constraints , ensuring 
that adversarial forces  - whether organic or intentionally constructed  - are systematically 
countered . 
Strategic objectives must translate into operational and tactical execution . AI-literate leadership is 
essential for turning strategy into action , requiring specialized training  to ensure proper 
implementation. At the tactical level, AI must be integrated into specific, ordered activities that 
align with broader national goals . 
To maintain strategic superiority , AI strategy must be continuously evaluated and recalibrated . AI 
is not static, nor is the geopolitical landscape  in which it operates. Nations that embed adaptive 


9 | P a g e
evaluation into their AI strategies  will sustain long-term dominance , while those relying on rigid, 
outdated plans  will be outmaneuvered by more agile competitors . 
In short, AI strategy is not just about technological progress  - it is about shaping the competitive 
landscape in a nation’s favor, neutralizing threats, and continuously refining execution . Nations 
that fail to embed strategic foresight  into their AI plans will not lead the AI era  - they will be shaped 
by those who do . 
Action 5: Include Value Chains and Markets in the Planning Process  
The reality of competition inevitably leads to competing value chains . AI is redefining both 
competitive and comparative advantages  of nations, disrupting traditional market structures and 
forcing a reassessment of economic power. The long -standing foundations of domestic and 
international competition  are being reshaped by AI, introducing new paradigms of economic 
rivalry  that demand strategic adaptation.  
Understanding how AI will restructure markets and supply chains  is essential for any AI strategy. 
AI-driven automation, predictive analytics, and optimization algorithms will reconfigure supply 
chains , altering how goods, services, and capital move across borders. These shifts will, in turn, 
trigger a chain reaction of adjustments across other economic variables  - from pricing models to 
logistics frameworks, from labor distribution to corporate strategy. As each variable realigns, 
supply chains will continuously adapt in ways never before possible  in traditional market 
structures.  
The financial sector will also undergo fundamental transformation . AI will not just attract capital 
flows into AI -driven industries  - it will alter the core structure of financial markets themselves . As 
AI automates investment decisions, optimizes risk management, and increases trading efficiency, 
we can expect a surge in transaction velocity, higher trade volumes, and a shift in market frequency 
dynamics . Algorithmic trading and AI -powered market intelligence will lead to new forms of 
financial competition , intensifying volatility but also unlocking unparalleled efficiencies.  
Beyond financial markets, AI will accelerate Schumpeterian creative destruction , where obsolete 
business models will collapse under the weight of AI -driven efficiency . Industries that fail to 
integrate AI will see their capital eroded and reallocated  to AI -powered competitors. This 
destruction is not limited to businesses  - entire national economies will be reshaped , as those that 
embrace AI will command superior economic structures, while those that resist will suffer 
stagnation.  
Success in this AI -driven economic landscape depends not only on technical AI capabilities but 
also on social and political acceptance . Public understanding of AI’s role in value creation, 
economic efficiency, and competitive advantage  will be critical for adoption. Societies that resist 


10 | P a g e
AI-driven transformation will experience economic decline , while those that integrate AI 
seamlessly into markets, industries, and national strategies  will dominate the future global 
economy . 
AI is not just another technological wave  - it is a seismic force that will dictate the winners and 
losers of the next economic era . Nations that fail to anticipate and shape  AI’s impact on value 
chains and markets will cede their economic sovereignty to those that do . 
Action 6: AI Strategy and Action Plan Through the Lens of Complexity Theory  
A national AI strategy must be built on complexity science , not linear policymaking. AI does not 
just improve efficiency  - it transforms the very structures of competition, governance, and social 
order . A well -crafted strategy must:  
•Recognize AI as a disruptive force that alters institutions, not just operations.
•Account for unpredictable emergent behaviors in human -AI interactions.
•Develop dynamic policy frameworks that evolve alongside AI’s rapid transformation.
•Ensure that AI -driven optimization does not sacrifice resilience and adaptability.
A national AI strategy cannot be formulated in isolation from complexity theory . The fundamental 
challenge in designing such a strategy is that it must account for AI’s transformative impact on 
complex systems  - cities, firms, markets, political institutions, and societal norms  - all of which 
emerge from the interactions of agents and the rules governing those interactions. AI is not merely 
an additional tool within existing structures; it is a force that reorients and restructures those very 
structures , placing traditional institutions in flux.  
At the heart of this transformation are two core factors:  
1. AI as a New Class of Intelligent Agents : For the first time in history, non-human intelligent
decision -makers  are becoming integral to national economies, security apparatuses, and
governance systems. This is a radical departure from the past, where all systems  - no matter how
complex  - were ultimately the result of human cognition, biases, and behavioral constraints . The
introduction of AI as a knowledge -seeker and decision -maker  breaks the previous equilibrium,
raising fundamental questions about institutional robustness.  Complex systems were already
unpredictable and dynamic  with just human actors. The presence of AI -driven agents  - operating
under different learning mechanisms, training data, and optimization functions  - creates an entirely
new layer of interactions . Whether in cybersecurity, financial markets, military strategy, or
economic planning, AI -driven decision -making alters the rules governing institutions and
infrastructures. The consequences of this shift are not merely operational  - they are systemic.
2. AI -Driven Evolution of Human -Machine Interactions : Human interactions are governed by
biological, psychological, and evolutionary constraints  that have shaped our economic, political,


11 | P a g e
and social structures for centuries. These structures  - democracy, justice, family, governance  - are 
emergent properties of millennia of human -to-human interactions . AI introduces a new dynamic:  
•Human -to-Human Interactions  (traditional structures remain)
•Human -to-Machine Interactions  (humans adjust to AI decision -making)
•Machine -to-Human Interactions  (AI influences human behavior, shaping opinions,
markets, and political choices)
•Machine -to-Machine Interactions  (autonomous AI systems negotiate, trade, and compete
without human input)
This shift challenges longstanding emergent structures  and makes their future trajectories 
uncertain. It is not simply a matter of making AI ethical or removing biases  - altering interaction 
rules without understanding how they propagate across complex layers  can create unintended and 
undesirable emergent patterns . For example, AI governance often assumes that eliminating bias in 
datasets will make AI more ethical. While this is true at the individual decision level , it does not 
account for how large -scale social patterns might shift  when biased or improvisational decision -
making is removed. Just as traffic models predict smoother flows with autonomous vehicles but 
overlook the adaptability of human drivers , rigid AI -driven systems may reduce local inefficiencies 
but introduce fragility in unpredictable environments . 
The Risk of Unintended Institutional Disruptions  
If AI changes how individuals think, interact, and operate within a system , it inevitably changes 
the larger institutional structures  that emerge from those interactions. This means AI will reshape 
democracy, liberty, justice, family structures, economic models, and governance frameworks  - not 
necessarily by design, but as a consequence of aggregated AI -driven interactions . 
The danger is not that AI will be misused , but that we simply do not yet understand how novelty 
will emerge  from the structural transformations it causes. AI -driven automation may create 
economic efficiencies , but it may also undermine democratic institutions by altering political 
discourse . AI-led decision -making in financial markets may optimize transactions , but it could also 
exacerbate systemic risks by removing human improvisation and flexibility . 
A Complexity -Based Approach to AI Strategy  
Developing a national AI strategy without modeling these forces is reckless . AI does not operate 
in isolation  - it is embedded within a web of evolving interactions, incentives, and counterforces . 
A complexity -based approach  to AI strategy must:  
•Map the interactions between human and AI -driven agents  across economic, political, and
social domains.


12 | P a g e
•Model AI -driven institutional shifts  to anticipate emergent disruptions before they reach
crisis levels.
•Identify weak points in existing governance, economic, and security structures  that may
become fragile under AI -driven transformations.
•Develop flexible and adaptive AI policy frameworks  that evolve with AI’s rapid
advancements rather than remain static.
Action 7: Integrate Culture and Communications in AI Strategy  
Culture profoundly influences the formulation, adoption, and execution  of national strategies. Any 
AI strategy that fails to account for cultural dynamics  risks encountering resistance, inefficiency, 
or outright failure. Technology adoption is not solely a technical or economic process  - it is a 
cultural phenomenon , shaped by the values, ideologies, and societal norms  of the country in which 
it is being implemented.  
For example, the Chinese approach to national AI programs  is structured around centralized state 
planning, collective societal goals, and top -down directives , leading to cohesive and large -scale 
execution . In contrast, the American approach  is marked by market -driven innovation, 
decentralized governance, and individualistic enterprise , resulting in fragmented but dynamic 
advancements . These cultural differences mean that identical AI strategies would yield vastly 
different outcomes in each country . 
Integrating Culture into AI Strategy  
To design an AI strategy that is effective within a given nation, cultural factors must be embedded 
into the strategy itself . This includes:  
•Recognizing how national values shape AI adoption  (e.g., data privacy concerns in the U.S.
vs. centralized data control in China).
•Understanding how citizens perceive technological change  (e.g., AI as an enabler of
progress vs. AI as a threat to jobs and autonomy).
•Tailoring policy and implementation methods  to align with cultural attitudes toward
governance, innovation, and labor markets.
The Role of Communication in AI Rollout  
A national AI strategy is not just a technical or economic blueprint  - it is a narrative that must 
inspire, mobilize, and unify a country . The success of AI adoption depends on how effectively the 
strategy is communicated  to businesses, policymakers, institutions, and the public. Without a 
compelling national vision , even the most technically sound strategy will fail to generate 
momentum.  


13 | P a g e
Effective communication requires:  
•Framing AI as a national mission  that resonates with cultural values.
•Engaging diverse stakeholders  (businesses, universities, civil society) to ensure alignment.
•Addressing fears and uncertainties  by demonstrating how AI benefits individuals and
communities.
•Using culturally relevant messaging  that connects AI to national identity and aspirations.
AI adoption is not just a technological transformation  - it is a societal shift . The success of national 
AI programs depends on how well strategy aligns with culture  and how effectively it is 
communicated . Nations that integrate cultural intelligence into their AI strategies  will mobilize 
public support, accelerate adoption, and sustain long -term success, while those that ignore cultural 
dimensions risk facing resistance and stagnation . 
Action 8: Sepa rate Policies and Strategies in AI Planning  
Distinguishing between strategy and policy  is essential in AI strategic planning. While the two are 
often conflated, they serve distinct roles: strategy defines objectives and direction , while policy 
provides the tools to implement them . In the case of AI, there is no ambiguity  - policy must follow 
strategy , not the other way around.  
Policies should be designed as instruments to achieve strategic objectives , rather than restricting 
or dictating what those objectives should be. A strategy -first approach ensures that AI policies are 
purpose -driven and aligned with national interests , rather than being reactive or fragmented. 
Allowing policy concerns to dictate strategy leads to narrow, short -term decision -making , which 
is particularly dangerous in AI, where the long -term implications are profound and far -reaching.  
In the United States, Congress has largely followed this model, with the House and Senate crafting 
AI policies in response to strategies provided by agencies  and expert bodies. While greater 
transparency and interdisciplinary coordination could improve the process, the fundamental 
approach  - letting strategy drive policymaking  - is working.  This places significant responsibility 
upon agencies that they must make the right recommendations.   
Establishing the Strategy -Policy Link  
For AI strategies to be effective, a structured channel between strategic planning and policymaking 
must be established . This means:  
•Ensuring policymakers are informed by national AI strategies, not the other way around.
•Creating mechanisms for continuous feedback  so that policies evolve in response to
strategic execution.


14 | P a g e
•Developing AI governance frameworks that are adaptable , allowing strategy to drive long -
term planning while policy handles execution.
AI is too transformative  to be limited by pre -existing policies . A nation’s AI trajectory must be 
determined by well -defined strategic objectives , with policies structured to support, amplify, and 
execute  those objectives. Nations that fail to separate policy from strategy risk creating 
fragmented, ineffective AI programs , while those that get this right will ensure AI remains a 
powerful, integrated force in national development.  
 
The American Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Its Mission  
The American Institute of Artificial Intelligence (AIAI)  is a leading institution committed to 
advancing artificial intelligence (AI) for national security, governance, and economic 
competitiveness . Unlike traditional AI research organizations that focus on theoretical 
advancements or commercial applications, AIAI is dedicated to applying AI strategically  to 
strengthen national security, enhance government operations, and ensure that the United States 
maintains its global leadership in an increasingly AI -driven geopolitical landscape.  
As AI reshapes global power dynamics, it is imperative that the United States not only leads in AI 
research but also develops robust AI strategies that secure its national interests . AIAI has played a 
pivotal role in shaping AI policies and frameworks that integrate AI into defense, intelligence, 
cybersecurity, and strategic decision -making. The institute’s work is driven by the understanding 
that AI is not merely a tool for efficiency  - it is a force multiplier that can redefine security, 
diplomacy, and competitive advantage . 
AIAI’s Contributions to National Security AI  
AIAI has been at the forefront of shaping AI strategies for government agencies, military branches, 
and intelligence organizations . Its work ensures that AI is deployed not only as an automation tool 
but as a transformative capability that enhances national security and geopolitical strength . 
Among its key contributions, AIAI has played a critical role in AI National Strategy Development , 
consulting with the U.S. Senate office  to contribute to the formulation of the U.S. AI national 
strategy . The institute has also led AI initiatives in defense and security  education , developing AI 
frameworks for military decision -making, hybrid warfare modeling, and autonomous defense 
systems . ________________________  SECTION 5 ________________________
