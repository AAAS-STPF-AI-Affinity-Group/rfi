To Whom It May Concern:
I'm writing to express my deepest opposition to the AI action plan.  
I'm a journalist and a writer and I own my work.   Your AI action plan is a violation of my
copyright.   It is frankly theft of my labor - hundreds of thousands hours of formal education
and learning my craft   to great expense to enrich private corporations.  
If entities like OpenAi want my work they should approach me directly and compensate me as
well as give me right to refusal. At minimum they should pay my student loans since their goalis to make me unemployable.
I strongly oppose this regulation.
