General Comment
I am  highly against the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the context of what is being purposed here. Within this presidential order,
what this action plan will do is generally steal from  all sources of data without any individual or organizational consent to participate within
this plan to begin with. Any individual or organization does not have the ability to opt out of this "voluntary process" that this plan suggest
and will allow anyone who is gathering data from  all "volunteered sources" to do so without any legal ram ifications.
Sim ply put, it is stealing data from  all individuals in the hopes of gathering, training, and using our own data against the Am erican people. It
will m assively accelerate the usage of m isinform ation due to faulty AI generated or user spoofed results, cost the Am erican people m ore
m oney to sustain this failing effort, and cause m ore dam age to the environm ent due to its constant need of powerful com puter equipm ent
that needs a m assive cost of high energy consum ption to even run such a powerful algorithm ic AI m odels.
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
* AI steals from  the livelihood of m any Am ericans and prom otes profits off of theft.
* AI is considered to be over-hyped due to its m arketed "prom ise" and is fleecing/lying to the eyes of the Am erican public.
In addition to m y personal beliefs in this m atter, I am  also including the following inform ation below which I HIGHLY recom m end you
read through in its entirety. It will highly som e of the key issues that AI will bring to the Am erican people and will further plunge us into
paying for a project that is doom ed to fail.
While OpenAI has m ade significant strides in advancing artificial intelligence, there are several disadvantages and challenges associated
with its technologies and operations. Understanding these lim itations is crucial for users, developers, and stakeholders involved with
OpenAI.
Accessing and utilizing OpenAI's advanced m odels, such as GPT-4, can be expensive. The pricing structure for API usage m ay be
prohibitive for individual developers, startups, or sm all businesses with lim ited budgets. This high cost can lim it the accessibility of
OpenAI's technologies to a broader audience.
OpenAI's powerful AI m odels have raised ethical issues related to their potential m isuse. These concerns include:
* Content Generation: The ability to generate realistic text can be exploited for creating m isleading inform ation, deepfakes, or spam .
* Bias and Fairness: AI m odels can inadvertently perpetuate and am plify existing societal biases present in the training data, leading to
unfair or discrim inatory outcom es.
* Privacy: The use of large datasets for training m odels m ay raise privacy concerns, especially if sensitive inform ation is involved.
Addressing these ethical challenges requires ongoing efforts in research, regulation, and the developm ent of robust safeguards.
While OpenAI publishes research papers and shares insights into their m odels, som e aspects rem ain proprietary. This lim ited transparency
can hinder the broader understanding and trust in how these m odels function. Users and researchers m ay find it challenging to fully grasp


the inner workings or lim itations of OpenAI's technologies without com plete access to the underlying m echanism s.
Training state-of-the-art AI m odels like those developed by OpenAI dem ands vast am ounts of data and significant com putational power.
This dependence on extensive resources can lead to:
* Environm ental Im pact: The energy consum ption required for training large m odels contributes to a substantial carbon footprint.
* Resource Allocation: Organizations with lim ited access to high-perform ance com puting m ay struggle to com pete or innovate at the sam e
pace.
The centralized control of powerful AI technologies by organizations like OpenAI raises questions about governance and accountability.
Ensuring that AI developm ent aligns with societal values and benefits all stakeholders is a com plex challenge that requires collaborative
efforts between developers, policym akers, and the public.
Despite efforts to m ake AI m ore accessible, there rem ains a gap in dem ocratizing these technologies. Factors such as high costs, technical
com plexity, and lim ited educational resources can prevent a wider audience from  leveraging OpenAI's tools effectively. This disparity can
exacerbate existing inequalities in technology access and innovation.
The use of AI-generated content introduces com plexities around intellectual property rights. Determ ining ownership and rights over AI-
generated works, such as text, im ages, or code, is an evolving legal area that can pose challenges for creators and businesses alike.
