General Comment
If hum ans can't steal from  each other without breaking the laws created by God and our forefathers, then why does som ething created by
hum ans to be in the service is hum ans get a free pass to violate hum anity just because it isn't alive by the definition of science? That's going
right down Term inator Boulevard all you big tech afficionado. Pretty soon hum an life will be stolen for the benefit of AI, and not
hyperbole, not in the form  of jobs and livelihoods cuz big corp wants to save m oney with big tech that is still in digital diapers despite
talking big. Respect hum anity. Moreso than at present. AI is hum an m ade and thus not exem pt from  hum an law. No stealing. Thou shalt
not steal.
