General Comment
I have witnessed and heard of so m any cases of an artist's art being deliberately fed into an AI m odel in order to claim  the subsequent
output. I've heard stories of a writer's work being fed into ChatGPT and plagiarized. I've heard stories of com panies laying off their
em ployees due to seeing AI as the cheaper, easier option, only to regret it after-the-fact as their productivity is nowhere near what it'd
been without their previous workforce. I've seen m uch m isinform ation spread through Google's own AI as well as OpenAI, especially in
the concern of m edical m isinform ation, which could get good people killed.
There is a option on Twitter to quite literally feed any im age you see into Grok, their custom  AI m odel; this can be done, theoretically and
likely has been, with copyrighted m aterial and be claim ed by the user in question as their own when it is clearly not.
To enact this EO is to enact a slow death in the life of creativity, productivity, and the ability for every day Am ericans to be able to protect
what they have created in the face of an ever-growing line of AI m odels being produced by corporations and people with questionable
m orals in the face of m aking a dim e.
