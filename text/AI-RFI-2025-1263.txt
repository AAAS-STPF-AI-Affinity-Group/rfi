General Comment
AI is the death of art. You take all our heartfelt drawings, paintings, and writing, m ix it up in a blender, and spew it out to m ake m oney. To
be num ber one. You’re so focused on winning you don’t realize what you will lose. I understand that AI can som etim es be used for good,
but it can also take away what m akes us hum an. If you can just steal all of m y art and writing that I worked so hard to create, what’s the
point? Everyone just needs to get over AI and learn how to create things them selves. I’m  so sick of it. I will never use AI to generate or
create anything. I’d rather do it m yself and fail.
