I do not consider that it is currently illegal to steal work from artists an "unnecessary burden".  
My work has value and it is insulting that AI companies and this EO suggest I should just give
away the product of my work. This would be the communism this government so fiercelyclaims they hate, except the AI company will monetize my work rather than returning it freelyto the people. Meanwhile, AI has reduced my wages and stolen my jobs.
