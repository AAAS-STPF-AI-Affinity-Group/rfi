General Comment
AI should be heavily regulated and properly legislated. In it's current state, AI is putting hard working Am erican people out of a job
because it is being used as an im poster for real work. AI art is a joke com pared to real art, in any form  (writing, drawing, graphic design,
etc.) and should never be used as a supplem ent for genuine hum an effort. Children, and teachers in schools are being bom barded with
falsified schoolwork from  untrustworthy sources, because people using AI are spreading m isinform ation about anything and everything,
including but not lim ited to history, science, technology, and people. Not only does Artificial Intelligence need to be heavily regulated in it's
com m ercial use, but it also needs to be regulated in it's cooperate usage, as to not endanger com panies or em ployees, but also what
inform ation can be used to train these AI. The dead internet theory is a perfect exam ple of the third issue. There are now parts of the
internet wherein different AI accounts on social m edia will interact with each other, without hum an input, m eaning that the World Wide
Web is being corrupted and crowded with bots who are providing nothing good to society. I will attach links to support these claim s, but
please do your own research. https://www.forbes.com /sites/danidiplacido/2024/01/16/the-dead-internet-theory-explained/
