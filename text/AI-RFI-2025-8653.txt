General Comment
This obsession with AI has always been so stran ge to me. It's a sou lless machine that gobbles up whatever is fed (w illingly given or 
stolen)  to it and &^% out some unrem arkable slop. It's disrespectf ul to the real living, breath ing people who hone creati ve crafts to 
have their  work stolen by th is tech nology. Generati ve AI has no place in this cou ntry, the energy and resources needed to keep it 
running is such a  waste, and it can barely even reg urgitate correct information an yway, how cou ld it possibly be helpful in serious 
decision making, especial ly if left unchecked with no reg ulations?
