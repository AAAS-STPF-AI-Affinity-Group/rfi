General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is being touted around as a revolutionary tool and cost cutting, tim e saving solution when in reality its an invasive,
m essy, uncaring algorithm  that steals data, im ages, and video with no regard for where it cam e from  or how it was m ade. It seem s like the
future and the way forward, but it isn't what we're being m ade to think it is by com panies. Its very expensive to m aintain, spreads
m isinform ation, a security risk for sensitive data, and will be used to replace hum an labor for no good reason. Its already caused m ore
harm  than good by m aking everyone second guess inform ation and im ages they see if it seem s even a little out of place, and will only get
worse if its allowed to invade m ore spaces to train on m ore data. While it m ay be unreasonable to think it can be rem oved com pletely, it
m ust at the very least be regulated, restrained, and can't be allowed to have unchecked power. We could very well get to a point where
nobody knows what the truth is anym ore since it'll all be written by m achines.
