General Comment
I vehem ently oppose the ability for anyone developing AI to have carte blanche free reign to train on anyone's data in abeyance of
copyright or any other laws. As a creative, I've seen too m any people's work stolen an regurgitated through large language m odels;
som ething we need to protect as the current laws should be doing, rather than stripping away their basic rights on art work to be used
without com pensation. Nor do I want to see an AI com pany able to use private inform ation and be free of any consequences if such
inform ation is used im properly. 
Safety nets need to this technology do need to exist. It is currently used far too m uch for the low level of understanding of it's users, and
being used to the detrim ent of the people that generated the data it has been trained on. Giving all the power to AI corporations to do
what they want will lead to lower overall quality of written, artistic, or any other m edia generated because it will replace the actual creative
forces it was created on with no ability to go beyond kitbashing the original works together. Rem oving all rights to the original creators and
ignoring such laws and rights we have now won't m ake the USA better, just m ore efficient and generating a poor product.
