General Comment
AI should not be able to be trained on inform ation or content that the com pany doesn't own. This can cause copyright infringem ent,
violation of intellectual property, and other risks and should be legally actionable.
As said by Travel Lem m ing: "the Adm inistration should create an AI Action Plan that protects sm aller creators and publishers, m aintains
copyright protections, facilitates a robust and com petitive licensing m arketplace, and requires transparency and disclosure of all AI-
generated content."
