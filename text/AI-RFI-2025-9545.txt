General Comment
Generative AI without the consent of those whose data is being input, be it voices, photographs, art of any variety, inform ation, etc, is
STEALING. I donâ€™t know a single soul who is happy for content everywhere to be ripped from  the hands of those who own it to be
collaged and repurposed for the use of generative AI. Generative AI that lacks consent should be illegal.
