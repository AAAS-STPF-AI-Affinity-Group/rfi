General Comment
I am  a writer, poet, and sm all business owner who has copyrighted m aterial available on the web. Any AI policy created by this RFI
needs to ensure that writers have an easy m ethod for authors to indicate that they don't want their m aterial used in AI m odels, and sim ilarly
an easy way to discover and rem ove m aterial from  existing m odels. Without a way to exclude copyrighted m aterial from  an AI m odel, the
US governm ent will essentially be saying it's okay for com panies to steal intellectual property. What is the point of having a copyright if this
type of theft is perm itted? When creating their plan, NITRD NCO m ust take the rights of copyright holders into account and protect us
from  AI com panies.
