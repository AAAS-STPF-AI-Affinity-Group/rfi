Iâ€™m writing to submit a public comment on the AI action plan. As a publishing industry
employee and a professional writer, I am concerned about the fact that all generative AI relieson digested and regurgitated intellectual property used without permission. The results haveno creative or efficiency value that justifies their baseline lack of ethics; indeed, withoutstrenuous human involvement generative AI is inaccurate at best, potentially dangerouslyinaccurate. (See, for instance, this new study from the Columbia Journalism Review:https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/we-compared-eight-ai-search-engines-theyre-all-bad-at-citing-
news.php )
In short, this is a technology that turns stolen material into worthless junk; why are we givingit a second thought?
Sincerely,
Jess ZimmermanEditor
