General Comment
Current copyright law prom otes innovation and thriving within the United States creative m arket. To grant AI com panies an exception to
copyright would be devastating and cause irreparable harm  to the great lead our country has in the world's creative econom y. Currently
AI com panies train as they please on anything they can find, from  our country, from  other countries, everything and anything. And the best
they can com e up with is knockoffs and watered down versions of existing creative work. It is necessary for both the incentivizing of
innovation and the future of fairness in the creative econom y that copyright not be disassem bled in a bleak attem pt to outcom pete our own
Am erican artists and m usicians.
