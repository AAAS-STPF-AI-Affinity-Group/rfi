General Comment
I would argue that we should continue to regulate and restrict AI so that it does not take jobs from  hardworking Am ericans in m ultiple
career fields. The people who are pushing for its deregulation and norm alization either do not care about the potential (and likely) negative
societal im pacts or are utilizing this as a power play.
