General Comment
While artificial intelligence m ay have som e valuable use cases, that is not the case for its current use. At this point in tim e, AI is at once a
speculative bubble that is vastly overvalued, an unreliable search engine that often confidently offers false inform ation, and an easy way for
m alicious actors to m anufacture everything from  fake revenge porn to CSAM. It needs to be brought under control and highly regulated,
and cannot be allowed to continue its harm ful current state.
