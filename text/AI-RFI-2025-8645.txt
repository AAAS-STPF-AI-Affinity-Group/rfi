Subject: National Science Foundation’s Request for Inform ation on Developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
As a sm all business owner and visual artist, I’ve dedicated m y career to creating original work that not only supports m yself but also
contributes to the cultural and creative fabric of our country. However, the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, particularly system s
developed by tech giants like OpenAI and Google, has introduced a profound challenge to creators like m e. These com panies are
leveraging our work—often without perm ission or com pensation—to build AI tools that directly com pete with us, all while pushing for
changes to copyright law that would further erode our rights.
The issue at hand is not just about technology; it’s about fairness, ownership, and the future of creativity in Am erica. AI system s are
trained on vast datasets that include the work of countless artists, writers, m usicians, and designers. My designs, along with the creations
of so m any others, have been fed into these system s without our knowledge, let alone our consent. These com panies then use our work to
produce outputs that m im ic our styles, undercut our businesses, and ultim ately devalue the very skills we’ve spent years developing.
Now, these sam e com panies are advocating for legal changes that would allow them  to continue this practice under the um brella of “fair
use.” They argue that if an AI system  processes copyrighted m aterial, it should be exem pt from  the sam e protections that apply to hum an
creators. This reasoning is not only flawed but dangerous. It suggests that anything shared online—regardless of who created it—is fair
gam e for corporate exploitation. They claim  this is necessary for innovation, but in reality, it underm ines the very foundation of creativity.
The purpose of copyright law is to protect creators and incentivize innovation. 
If we allow tech com panies to freely use and profit from  our work without perm ission or com pensation, we risk dism antling the ecosystem
that fosters creativity. Why would anyone invest tim e, energy, and resources into creating som ething new if they know it can be instantly
copied, repurposed, and sold by a m achine? How can sm all businesses like m ine survive in a world where our work is com m odified by
corporations with far greater resources and reach?
To truly support innovation, this adm inistration m ust prioritize the rights of creators. 
The AI Action Plan should not be a handout to Big Tech; it should be a fram ework that ensures a fair and equitable playing field for all.
Here are three principles that should guide this effort:
Respect for Ownership: Creators m ust retain control over their work. Any use of copyrighted m aterial by AI system s should require
explicit perm ission from  the original creator. This ensures that individuals, not corporations, decide how their work is used.
Fair Com pensation: The AI Action Plan should prom ote a licensing system  that allows creators to be fairly com pensated for the use of
their work. This would create a sustainable m odel where both innovation and creativity can thrive, without sacrificing the rights of
individuals.


Transparency and Accountability: Com panies developing AI system s should be required to disclose the sources of their training data and
clearly label AI-generated content. This transparency is essential for m aintaining trust and ensuring that creators are aware of how their
work is being used.
I believe in the potential of AI to transform  industries and im prove lives, but not at the expense of creators like m yself. We cannot allow
the hard work and creativity of everyday Am ericans to be exploited for the benefit of a few powerful corporations. The AI Action Plan
m ust strike a balance that fosters innovation while protecting the rights and livelihoods of those who m ake creativity possible.
Thank you for considering m y perspective. I urge you to prioritize the rights of creators and ensure that the future of AI is one that benefits
everyone, not just the tech giants.
Sincerely,

Subject: National Science Foundation’s Request for Information on Developing an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
As a small business owner and visual artist, I’ve dedicated my career to creating original 
work that not only supports myself but also contributes to the cultural and creative fabric of our 
country. However, the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, particularly systems developed by tech 
giants like OpenAI and Google, has introduced a profound challenge to creators like me. These 
companies are leveraging our work—often without permission or compensation—to build AI 
tools that directly compete with us, all while pushing for changes to copyright law that would 
further erode our rights. The issue at hand is not just about technology; it’s about fairness, ownership, and the 
future of creativity in America. AI systems are trained on vast datasets that include the work of 
countless artists, writers, musicians, and designers. My designs, along with the creations of so 
many others, have been fed into these systems without our knowledge, let alone our consent. 
These companies then use our work to produce outputs that mimic our styles, undercut our 
businesses, and ultimately devalue the very skills we’ve spent years developing. 
Now, these same companies are advocating for legal changes that would allow them to 
continue this practice under the umbrella of “fair use.” They argue that if an AI system 
processes copyrighted material, it should be exempt from the same protections that apply to 
human creators. This reasoning is not only flawed but dangerous. It suggests that anything 
shared online—regardless of who created it—is fair game for corporate exploitation. They claim 
this is necessary for innovation, but in reality, it undermines the very foundation of creativity. 
The purpose of copyright law is to protect creators and incentivize innovation.  If we allow tech companies to freely use and profit from our work without permission or 
compensation, we risk dismantling the ecosystem that fosters creativity. Why would anyone 
invest time, energy, and resources into creating something new if they know it can be instantly 
copied, repurposed, and sold by a machine? How can small businesses like mine survive in a 
world where our work is commodified by corporations with far greater resources and reach? 
To truly support innovation, this administration must prioritize the rights of creators.  
The AI Action Plan should not be a handout to Big Tech; it should be a framework that 
ensures a fair and equitable playing field for all. Here are three principles that should guide this 
effort: 


Respect for Ownership: Creators must retain control over their work. Any use of copyrighted 
material by AI systems should require explicit permission from the original creator. This ensures 
that individuals, not corporations, decide how their work is used. 
Fair Compensation: The AI Action Plan should promote a licensing system that allows 
creators to be fairly compensated for the use of their work. This would create a sustainable 
model where both innovation and creativity can thrive, without sacrificing the rights of 
individuals. 
Transparency and Accountability: Companies developing AI systems should be required 
to disclose the sources of their training data and clearly label AI-generated content. This 
transparency is essential for maintaining trust and ensuring that creators are aware of how their 
work is being used. 
I believe in the potential of AI to transform industries and improve lives, but not at the 
expense of creators like myself. We cannot allow the hard work and creativity of everyday 
Americans to be exploited for the benefit of a few powerful corporations. The AI Action Plan 
must strike a balance that fosters innovation while protecting the rights and livelihoods of those 
who make creativity possible.
