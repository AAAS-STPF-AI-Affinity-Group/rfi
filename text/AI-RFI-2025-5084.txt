General Comment
Allowing AI and their com panies free rein to co-op, steal, and otherwise plagiarize legitim ate art, research, books, and any other form  of
m an-m ade m edia or products sets a dangerous precedent in allowing the willful disregard of copyright and intellectual property.
Rem oving "burdensom e" hurdles in the developm ent of AI is, in fact, allowing these com panies to train their data m odels using stolen and
appropriated inform ation without com pensation toward those who created the data (e.g. works of art).
If AI com panies can disregard these laws, how long before other com panies are allowed to sim ply disregard other com m ercial,
technological, or ethical safeguards and laws?
We cannot, and should not, condone this behavior or actions for the benefit of a few com panies that, in the short-term , have already
shown a disregard for anything but their own self-interest, and in the long-term , will harm  the livelihood of artists, writers, reporters,
directors, actors and m any others.
A line m ust be drawn, not a floodgates opened, because once it is, there will be no closing it.
