General Comment
A.I. is not the pioneering discovery that it is being m ade out to be, it is worse for the environm ent than em issions from  cars or livestock
com bined, and steals m ore from  those who truly work than the boss above them . It is sham eful to see the governm ent that is supposed to
protect those beneath them , instead finding another way to subvert and avoid actually changing things for the better. In short, artificial
intelligence will be the downfall of all, including those who seek to use it for their own agenda.
