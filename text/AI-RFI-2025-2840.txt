General Comment
AI steals the livelihood of any single person who works in entertainm ent, art, design, m usic, writing, coding, anything that involves hum an
com m m itm ent to work. It steals senselessly and without any sort of reason, creating inferior and false products as a result, whether it be
worse design work or actually factually wrong inform ation. If AI is allowed to run ram pant through the USA, it will destroy a large part of
the Am erican econom y and will dam age not only the reputation of the USA in the long run, but also lead the people to distrust any and all
inform ation they receive in any form .
The public eye already has shifted from  AI being a novelty item  to being a worthless service that shows the laziness and ineffective nature
of any person or entity using it to try to gain further standing, advertisem ent, or anything of that nature. In short, AI will steal off of hard-
working Am erican people and destroy their faith in inform ation, com panies, and the governm ent.
