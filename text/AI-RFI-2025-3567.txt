General Comment
AI has no place in the Am erican future as it currently stands. In its current form  it is a fad m etaphorically pulling the wool over the publics
eye stating it is the future of m any applications, however is currently only used to devalue, deskill, and displace hardworking artists,
authors, and other professionals.
I am  against this.
