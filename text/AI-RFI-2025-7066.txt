General Comment
AI as it's currently being m arketed and used is a plagiarism  m achine that still m anages to constantly get very basic inform ation wrong,
requiring a hum an to com e back and fix whatever it was doing, and at greater cost because now you've paid for thr AI and a hum an! It is
in no way worth investing in.
AI is a dead-end tech. It's all hype and no use, just like cryptocurrency and NFTs, which have both flopped spectacularly, leaving
everyone involved looking like absolute buffoons. Is that what you want? For Am erica to becom e the fool of the world?
