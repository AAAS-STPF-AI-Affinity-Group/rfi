General Comment
AI does not hold a place in the future of The United States. Generative AI is trained on the stolen creations of artists. Tech com panies
underpay workers in other countries as little as $1.50-$2/hr to spend 8 hours a day m arking stolen m aterial for use in AI m odels.
Com panies take the output and profit without perm ission or paym ent to the original creators. Reducing regulation only m akes it easier for
m ega corporations to profit while destroying the liveihood of others.
Kenyan workers with AI jobs thought they had tickets to the future until the grim  reality set in
