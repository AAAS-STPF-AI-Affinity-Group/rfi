While I am  not affiliated with any m ajor business or com panies of note in relation to AI, I have great concerns regarding these attem pts to
integrate data theft into our Am erican businesses. As a artist m yself, I find that AI negatively im pacts our artistic integrity and how we
respond to our cultural developm ent. It also allows for the rise of personal theft not only in the creative space, but for the identities of our
loved ones and how they are portrayed in such technology. I've seen plenty of disgusting and inappropriate m aterial generated by AI and I
do not want m y friends or fam ily affected by that.
Not to m ention, the m eans of m aintaining AI far exceed the dem and. It is far too costing in regards to power that could be used m ore
wisely, especially in rural states that do not have a sustainable power grid to support AI, thus further dam aging us in regards to our carbon
footprints. 
Artificial Intelligence and this form  of technology m ust be kept in line with rules and regulations to prevent predatory m aterial, unstable
power usage, and downright abuse of the m aterial that will only set us back from  what technology should actually provide for the people.
