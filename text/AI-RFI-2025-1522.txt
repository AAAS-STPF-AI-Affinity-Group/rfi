General Comment
Ai com panies should not be able to use artist work without perm ission or paym ent. Ai com panies have scrapped the internet and used
work that doesnâ€™t belong to them . 
Artists are encouraged by com panies to post our work online for em ploym ent but now the Ai com panies say artists work now belongs to
them ? This is wrong and should be corrected. Ai will lead to m ass unem ploym ent if not regulated. 
Thanks!
