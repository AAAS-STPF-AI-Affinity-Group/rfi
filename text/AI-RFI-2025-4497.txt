General Comment
It is against the nature of intellectual property to allow AI m odels to train on copyrighted works without any com pensation to the original
creators. This would spell disaster for the creator econom y and the arts in Am erica. Artists absolutely shouldn't be sacrificed at the altar of
"ensuring US dom inance in AI."
