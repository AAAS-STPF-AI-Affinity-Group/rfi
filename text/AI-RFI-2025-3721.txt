General Comment
Generative AI by the very nature of how it functions can not produce anything new, or with any thought or purpose. To allow it to skim
the works of hardworking artists who will in no way be com pensated for the actual labor they put in to creating the work that OpenAI
seeks to profit off of for free is tantam ount to theft. Do not allow this to pass.
