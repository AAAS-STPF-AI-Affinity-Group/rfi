General Comment
What could possibly be critical to Am erican interests that would m erit further disincentivizing individuals from  creating new, original work?
That’s what the proposal from  OpenAI and Google would do: open the door even m ore for those business to exploit creatives.
Current copyright legislation protects creative works m ade by people. It is sim ply not true that using creative works to train AI — without
their creator’s consent — is a form  of Fair Use, regardless of where they are posted publicly. PUBLICLY VIEWABLE IS NOT
LICENSE FOR FREE USE.
The AI built from  them  generates lookalikes that are com peting with the original creators. This is currently cutting into the (already m eager)
living of working creatives, and I am  hearing how about how it is dissuading the next generation from  pursuing creative work (and for
som e, m oving them  into a state of m ental health crisis).
Please keep a shred of decency about the value of hum an-created works and stop this erosion of copyright. It won’t m ake the U.S. safer,
but it will reduce our creative strength.
