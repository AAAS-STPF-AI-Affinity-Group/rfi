Hello Mr. D'Souza, 
On behalf of RAD Security, I am submitting this response to the Request for Information 
(RFI) regarding the development of the AI Action Plan as part of the National Science Foundation’s ongoing efforts to shape U.S. AI policy. Our company, RAD Security (A Gula Adventure and Forgepoint Ventures Portfolio Company) is committed to advancing AI 
security by identifying and mitigating threats to AI workloads, detecting shadow AI, and ensuring that AI systems are secure, resilient, and aligned with regulatory frameworks. 
Introduction to RAD Security 
RAD Security is a leading provider of solutions focused on the protection of AI infrastructure and workloads. We specialize in identifying potential vulnerabilities within AI environments, including data exfiltration risks, shadow AI, and threats from risky identities. Our solutions leverage cutting -edge techniques, including mapping results to NIST AI Risk 
Management Framework (RMP), FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk), and ISO 42001 to ensure a secure AI lifecycle from development to deployment. 
Key Areas of Contribution: 
Cybersecurity and AI Threat Detection: RAD Security plays a critical role in ensuring the security of AI systems by detecting threats at both the infrastructure and application levels. We focus on safeguarding AI models from model attacks, securing data privacy, and preventing data exfiltration. We believe this is vital to advancing national AI interests while securing public and private sector AI deployments. 
Mapping Results to NIST AI RMP, FAIR, and ISO 42001: Our solutions are designed with a 
deep understanding of recognized frameworks like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMP) and ISO 42001, ensuring our methodologies align with current standards for AI governance and security. By applying these frameworks, RAD Security helps organizations effectively assess and mitigate risks associated with AI development and deployment, while maintaining the flexibility needed to innovate. 


Data Privacy and Security Across the AI Lifecycle: RAD Security focuses on securing data 
throughout the entire lifecycle of AI models. We aim to address emerging threats related to data integrity and leakage, aligning our security practices with national p olicies and 
frameworks designed to enhance the U.S.'s competitive edge while maintaining stringent privacy and security protocols. 
Risks from Shadow AI and Risky Identities: We identify and mitigate risks associated with 
shadow AI —AI models or systems deployed outside of an organization’s official channels 
that might introduce hidden vulnerabilities. Additionally, our tools focus on identifying and managing risky identities—entities that may pose a security risk to AI systems, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating insider threats. 
Support for National Security and Defense: As AI systems become increasingly integral to 
national security, RAD Security is committed to supporting the development of AI systems 
that are both secure and resilient. By aligning with frameworks like the NIST AI RMP, our 
services support the safe integration of AI technologies into defense applications and critical infrastructure. 
Concrete AI Policy Recommendations: 
Development of National AI Security Standards: We recommend that the AI Action Plan include the establishment of robust, consistent standards for AI model security, focusing on resilience against cyberattacks and ensuring that AI systems meet stringent security benchmarks before being deployed in critical infrastructure or defense sectors. 
Incentives for AI Security Investments: Encourage both public and private sector entities to 
invest in AI security by offering incentives for organizations that implement rigorous security measures such as NIST AI RMP-aligned risk assessments and ISO 42001-based governance. This would help mitigate risks associated with AI adoption, such as data leakage and unauthorized access. 
Support for Secure AI Innovation: We propose the creation of initiatives that enable the 
private sector to innovate in AI while maintaining security, ensuring that the AI workforce and infrastructure adhere to the highest standards of privacy and data protection, helping to minimize risks associated with AI models that could be used maliciously. 
Collaboration Between Industry and Government on AI Safety: The AI Action Plan should 
encourage collaboration between industry and government to share knowledge, best practices, and threat intelligence on AI security and risk management. This partnership w ill 
help strengthen America’s leadership in AI while safeguarding critical national infrastructure from potential AI-related risks. 
Conclusion:  
RAD Security is committed to supporting the development of secure AI systems that foster 


innovation and ensure that AI deployments are resilient to threats. We believe that the 
inclusion of frameworks like NIST AI RMP, FAIR, and ISO 42001 in the AI Action Plan will be 
essential in guiding the future of AI security policy. We look forward to collaborating on 
these efforts and ensuring that the United States maintains its leadership in AI while 
prioritizing security and privacy. 
Thank you for your consideration. We would welcome the opportunity to provide further 
details or participate in discussions on the development of the AI Action Plan. 
Sincerely, 
Brooke Motta, CEO/CoFounder
