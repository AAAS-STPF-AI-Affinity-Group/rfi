General Comment
AI has incredible capabilities to help advance m any fields. However, when it com es to training AI m odels, I believe there have to be som e
regulations in place to protect the intellectual property of sm all businesses and private citizens. 
Big Tech is currently using AI to first steal from  and then dem ote the content of business owners who run websites and other businesses
online. Once the likes of Google have forced independent websites to stop publishing due to lack of traffic, what content will they use then
to train their AI?
The environm ental cost of AI is also astronom ical, and should not be overlooked.
