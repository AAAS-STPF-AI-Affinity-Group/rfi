General Comment
OpenAI, Meta, and Google are not currently hindered in AI developm ent by a lack of copywritten content. They already scraped all of
the copywritten content they found to be valuable and trained their m odels on it. Even with m assive copyright theft, their m odels are still
unreliable for m ost real-world enterprise workloads. More copyright theft will not m ake the m odels sm arter; only m ore com pute and
better architecture will im prove the perform ance.
OpenAI, Meta, and Google want legal exem ptions not for technical reasons but to vacate lawsuits for theft already com m itted. 
Western culture is built on strong IP protections that reward innovation. To underm ine this would be a m assive loss for society at large,
hindering all future innovations. As we are already seeing in B2B and B2C AI deploym ents, AI has to be m ore than just plagiarism
m achines in order to solve real-world problem s.
That said, if a com prom ise m ust be m ade, non-com m ercial AI m odels developed SOLELY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY purposes
m ay be worth exem pting from  copyright law.
