Dear AI Action Plan Team,
I am writing in response to the Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. The rapid advancement of frontier AI models presents bothunprecedented opportunities and significant security risks, particularly in the realm ofcybersecurity and national defense. To maintain America's leadership in AI while protectingour critical infrastructure, I urge the immediate prioritization of a White Hat HackingManhattan Project as a foundational component of the AI Action Plan.
Why This is CriticalThe most advanced AI models—especially those capable of code generation, automation, and
self-improvement—pose a high risk of being leveraged for cyberattacks, both by nation-stateadversaries and independent threat actors. These systems can rapidly identify and exploitvulnerabilities in our digital infrastructure, outpacing traditional security measures.
The U.S. must act first by deploying our own frontier AI models to uncover and patch
vulnerabilities before adversaries do. The best defense against AI-driven cyber threats is to useAI offensively in a controlled, ethical manner—a strategy that has already been validated incybersecurity circles.
Key Proposal: A National White Hat Hacking InitiativeModeled after the Manhattan Project, this initiative would:1. Deploy the most powerful AI models to actively search for vulnerabilities across
government, military, and critical private-sector systems.
2. Simulate adversarial AI-driven cyberattacks to predict and prevent real-world threats.3. Develop AI-driven security frameworks that evolve in real-time to counteract emerging
threats.
4. Fund public-private partnerships to create the most secure AI and software infrastructure in
the world.
5. Ensure ethical and legal compliance while maximizing proactive defense strategies.


Why This Must Be the First AI Initiative
If we do not launch this effort immediately, our adversaries will weaponize AI against us. The
nation that first builds AI-capable cybersecurity frameworks will dictate the terms of globalcyber warfare and digital security for decades. The U.S. cannot afford to be reactive; we mustbe proactive.
I strongly urge the AI Action Plan to prioritize AI-driven security and ethical hacking as the
first and most critical AI application to ensure national resilience in the face of accelerating AIcapabilities.
Thank you for considering this urgent recommendation. I look forward to your leadership in
securing America’s future in AI.
Best regards,
Matthew KruseSelf Employed
