General Comment
AI is already doing m assive dam age to the ordinary people's lives, our jobs, the way that we find jobs. If they want to expand their
database, they need to hire people to m ake data for their database like everyone else. Being allowed to scrape copyrighted works hurts
not only sm all businesses but m assive corporations too. This harm  will m ake our econom y worse and m ake people reluctant to create or
share those creations if there is no protections.
