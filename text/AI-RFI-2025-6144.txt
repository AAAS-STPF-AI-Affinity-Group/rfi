General Comment
Any legitim ate use cases for AI should still require rigorous checks, especially as they pertain to the rights of artists of all kinds, other
com panies, and ultim ately anyone whose data or works m ay be scraped to feed the AI darabases and algorithm s. To rem ove these
guardrails would be a blatant negative for the rights of Am ericans, and should not be allowed.
