General Comment
AI cannot be allowed the protections that com panies such as OpenAI and Google are asking for. It will only result in m ass theft of IP and
constant recycling of ideas to the point that all we end up producing is soulless, inefficient garbage. It was never m eant to be used for
generation or for learning inform ation on the scale they're trying to do it at, and ESPECIALLY not in a constant stream  of inform ation like
the Internet, where anyone could feed it false our faulty inform ation.
