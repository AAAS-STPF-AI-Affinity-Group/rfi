General Comment
AI takes from  hard working Am ericans. It will destroy jobs form erly filled by hardworking Am ericans and it uses the copyrighted works
of Am erican citizens with no com pensation. It is an affront to everything this country stands for, the ability to work hard, and see rewards
for your work. Giving AI com panies special exceptions from  copyright laws will ruin several im portant industries and slowly destroy
Am erican culture. It m ust not happen.
