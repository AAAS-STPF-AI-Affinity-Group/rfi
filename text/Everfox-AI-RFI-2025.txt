Policy Recommendations 
1)Secure AI Mission Operations
AI plays a critical role in advancing mission success for the U.S. Department of Defense 
(DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC), particularly when data is properly sanitized and secured. Ensuring that AI models operate on validated, clean datasets enhances 
efficient decision-making capabilities and operational effectiveness while minimizing 
risks associated with adversarial manipulation. 
•Create and Leverage Secure AI Workflows:  Develop secure infrastructure and
best practices to allow AI to operate in controlled, classified, and mission-specific
environments where security is prioritized while still enabling rapid innovation.
•Sanitize and Validate Data Sources:  Ensure Government AI systems are
trained on reliable, vetted data to mitigate data poisoning and adversarial
exploitation while maintaining operational integrity for DoD and IC missions.


3 of 5 •Enhance AI’s Role in National Security:  Deploy AI capabilities in critical
environments to enable real-time intelligence analysis, mission planning, and
battlefield decision-making across multiple domains and classifications utilizing
NSA’s National Cross Domain Strategy & Management Office (NCDSMO)
approved solutions.
•Mission-Aligned Templates:  Develop preapproved architectural blueprints for
AI use cases (e.g., intelligence analysis, mission planning, and real-time threat
detection) to accelerate deployment across the DoD and IC.
•Life Cycle Support and Updates:  Maintain a continuous improvement cycle
that efficiently integrates new technology, patches security vulnerabilities, and
updates models to reflect the latest threat intelligence—ensuring the AI remainseffective and aligned with mission objectives.
2)Secure the AI Supply Chain
The integrity of the AI supply chain is vital for preserving America’s technological 
leadership and national security. Because adversaries target every aspect of AI 
development—hardware, software, data, algorithms, and personnel—it is imperative to 
establish a comprehensive security framework that efficiently protects against 
vulnerabilities, espionage, and supply chain attacks. A multi-layered, proactive 
approach is needed to ensure AI remains a trustworthy and resilient driver of national 
security and innovation. 
•Prevent Intellectual Property Theft:  Recent incidents, such as the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ ) action against a Chinese national for stealing AI
secrets from Google, underscore the urgent need to protect proprietary
technology. We recommend developing standardized protocols and best
practices to prevent the infiltration of adversaries into the AI supply chain,
ensuring that critical intellectual property remains safeguarded.
•End-to-End Supply Chain Security:  Implement comprehensive risk
management strategies that secure every stage of the AI supply chain. This
includes robust evaluation and certification of hardware components, such as
semiconductors and chips, as well as stringent security assessments for software
development and data acquisition processes.
•Collaborat e Across Sectors:  Establish public-private partnerships that bring
together industry leaders, government agencies, and academic institutions todevelop and enforce supply chain security standards. This collaboration should
focus on efficiently sharing threat intelligence, conducting joint vulnerability
assessments, and creating rapid-response frameworks for supply chain
incidents.
•Adopting a Prevention-First Approach:  Transition from reactive, detection-
based models to preemptive, prevention-first strategies that secure AI
development pipelines and supply chain processes from the outset. This includes
integrating preemptive security measures that shield the entire ecosystem from
emerging threats and malicious activities.


4 of 5 3)Establish Secure “AI Factories” for LLM Model Development
America’s leadership in AI hinges on the ability to rapidly develop, test, and deploy AI 
models in secure environments—particularly within the DoD and the IC. To address this 
need, we propose creating “AI Factories”: dedicated end-to-end development ecosystems that coordinate every step of the GenAI model life cycle, from design 
through deployment, with rigorous security controls. These secure facilities would be aligned with national security priorities and tailored to the unique operational 
requirements of defense and intelligence. 
3.1 Build a Dedicated, Trusted Environment
