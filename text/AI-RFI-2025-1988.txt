SCALE AI RESPONSE TO THE 
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
ACTION PLAN 
Scale AI is pleased to respond to the Request for Information RFI on the development of 
an Artificial Intelligence AI Action Plan.1 Scale strongly supports President Trump ʼs 
mission to “define the priority policy actions needed to sustain and enhance America's AI 
dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper 
private sector AI innovationˮ.2  
Introduction 
Scale was founded in 2016 and since that time has powered nearly every AI Innovation. 
From our earliest days working with the leading autonomous vehicle companies, to our 
work today with the leading Frontier AI labs and governments around the world, we have 
always been on the forefront of innovation. Our role in this critical ecosystem provides us 
a unique opportunity to understand how to build high quality AI systems, powered by the 
worldʼs best data.  
AI promises to be the most important technological innovation of our time and has already 
proven to make Americans lives better. Today, AI is powering groundbreaking medical 
research, improving efficiency in workplaces in every state and providing our nationʼs 
Department of Defense DOD  new capabilities which will continue to make our military 
the strongest in the world. Beyond the technology itself, AI also presents trillions of dollars 
of potential economic output and is on track to create millions of opportunities for the 
American workforce in the coming decades. 
The next four years will be crucial to deciding where the world ʼs premier AI systems will 
be built and whether they will be trained and shaped by Western or Chinese values. In 
order to ensure dominance, China is leveraging the full extent of their civil-military fusion, 
and the United States will only win if we not only match, but exceed their intensity.

The race for global leadership is well underway and the Chinese Communist Party 
CCP  is firmly committed to winning 
AI is made up of three main pillars–compute, data, and algorithms. More than one year 
ago, the United States was clearly ahead on all three. However, today that is no longer the 
case. Advancements from China, most notably with the launch of Deepseek, have shown 
that they have closed the gap. From Scaleʼs perspective, today, China is leading on data, 
we are tied on algorithms, and the United States remains ahead on compute. It ʼs clear that 
the race is neck and neck.  
In order to compete more aggressively, the CCP has implemented a whole of country 
approach, utilizing its government, industry, and military to superdrive its pursuit of 
becoming the global standard for AI. From an investment standpoint, and for the first time 
in history, China is benchmarking AI investments off of leading tech companies and not 
the United States government.  
When it comes to building out their data pipeline, China is sparring no expense. Last year, 
our analysis of publicly available materials found that China spent at least $1.2 billion 
dollars on data labeling alone. Additionally, as part of Chinaʼs AI plus initiative, the 
government established data labeling centers around the country with the lion's share of 
this work supporting public sector applications. In fact in May 2024, the National Data 
Bureau announced seven data labeling industrial bases will undertake the construction of 
specialized data annotation bases3: Chengdu Sichuan), Shenyang Liaoning), Hefei 
Anhui , Changsha Hunan , Haikou Hainan , Baoding Hebei , and Datong Shanxi .4 In

addition to setting up these hubs, they have also begun to heavily subsidize data labeling 
through vouchers, and other forms of tax breaks.5  
 
Beyond data, while the United States has been stuck in a research and pilot mindset, the 
CCP started to rapidly increase their investment in AI and field AI capabilities. In the first 
half of 2024 alone, the Peopleʼs Liberation Army issued 81 contracts - up from only one 
contract in 2023 - with Large Language Model companies to rapidly grow their 
capabilities.6  
 
President Trump rightly called the proliferation of Deepseek a “wake up call7ˮ and if that ʼs 
true–the question remains, how should the United States respond?  
 
Beating China relies on four main pillars–Protect, Promote, Unleash, and Innovate 
 If the United States wants to beat China, we must not only match but exceed the CCP ʼs 
intensity on AI. President Trump has already made this aspiration clear in his January 23, 
2025 Executive Order “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial 
Intelligenceˮ when he set our nation ʼs AI north star stating: “It is the policy of the United 
States to sustain and enhance America ʼs global AI dominance in order to promote human 
flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.8ˮ To fulfill this vision, the US 
must take bold steps and Scale believes the path forward must include decisive action on 
these four main pillars – Protect, Promote, Unleash, and Innovate. 
 
P ila r  O n e : P r o t e c t – The United States ʼ ability to leverage existing tools, such as export 
controls, to protect against adversaries having access to our leading technologies must 
be a primary focus. When it comes to AI, itʼs clear that the United States still has the 
world ʼs best technology companies, working on the world ʼs best technology which is 
being developed by the world ʼs best talent. These innovations have set the global 
standard for what best-in-class means and because of that, our adversaries are fully 
committed to gaining access to it. 
 
For that reason, tools like export controls have been effectively used by multiple 
Administrations to help ensure that our technology ends up in the hands of allies, and out 
of the hands of adversaries. However, export controls, alone, are not going to make 
certain that we beat China, but they have shown to be effective in slowing their progress.

Before we decide whether or not to put in place additional export controls, it ʼs clear that 
we need better enforcement of our existing ones already in place. Export controls are only 
as effective if they are properly enforced, and the United States Government has 
struggled with the enforcement mechanisms. For instance, the smuggling of powerful 
semiconductor chips into countries that should not have access to US technology is well 
known and until the USG utilizes its full arsenal of enforcement tools to stop that flow, no 
amount of export controls will be the sole solution to this problem.  
The Trump Administration will have tough decisions to make on whether or not to put in 
place new export controls, which chips and/or AI models to put controls over and how to 
best implement them. Scale recommends that prior to putting in place any new export 
controls, the Trump Administration does a comprehensive review of the USGʼs existing 
controls to better understand where new ones are required. Additionally, the 
Administration should place new emphasis and focus on the enforcement of our existing 
export controls to better protect our best-in-class technology from ending up in the hands 
of adversaries. 
P ila r  T w o : P r o m o t e  - Effective tech diplomacy heavily relies on the access and adoption 
of US technology by our allies. Over the past few years, the United States has simply not 
prioritized the promote aspect nearly as much as the protect aspect. But if our nation is to 
fulfill President Trumpʼs vision of United States technological dominance this must 
change.  
In the coming year, countries around the world may be forced to effectively choose 
between whether they want to use Western technology or Chinese technology. We have 
already seen examples of this choice9 and, in Scaleʼs experience, it ʼs clear that countries 
want to leverage the United States technology. However, when asking countries to make 
this choice, we believe, the United States must also provide those countries full access to 
US technology to ensure effective alignment.  
We have already seen this play out with respect to 5G technology. In the early days of 5G, 
the world had to choose whether to harness US technology or Chinese technology. The 
CCP, through its digital silk road initiative, was able to rapidly export their technology to 
many developing parts of the world leading to China effectively becoming the de facto 
global standard. This happened because the United States did not actively promote our 
technology and because of this, today, Chinaʼs global influence on 5G is much stronger 
than the United States ʼ.

Currently there are a number of government programs designed to promote the United 
States ʼ interest abroad, but AI is not eligible given those programs ʼmandates. Scale 
believes that programs like the Export-Import Bank and US Development Finance 
Corporation are two examples which should see their remits extended to include AI, and 
more broadly software exports. These programs have both been important tools in 
growing industry sectors and working to promote United States interests abroad, but AI 
should be included in this important work. To be clear, this is not an increased funding 
recommendation but rather a recommendation to expand eligibility and scope to meet the 
realities of today.  
Beyond exporting our technology to the world, the US must also lead in the development 
of measurement science for AI including standards and frameworks. The National 
Institute of Standards and Technology NIST  has been central in this critical function and 
must continue to play a central role so that the United States is at the forefront of building 
standards and then exporting this science to the world.  
 
Currently, there are a few different mechanisms to do this, but increasingly the Global 
Network of AI Safety Institutes is becoming more important. Currently, the global network 
is made up of 10 countries10 with the United States currently serving as the Chair. This is a 
ready-made entity to export our measurement science and it is vital that the United States 
is not only at the table, but also setting the tone and direction. To date, China has not 
been allowed entry into the body and so long as the US has a seat at the head of the table 
it should be guaranteed to stay that way. 
 
P ila r  T h r e e : U n le a s h  -  In order to dominate, the US needs to unleash our technology to 
the world, and the first step happens right here at home. As China has correctly identified, 
the best way to leverage AI is to start using it. While that may seem obvious, and despite 
the uneven playing field, the United States Government has fallen behind China when it 
comes to government use of AI.  
 
In our analysis, the Department of Defense is the furthest agency along when it comes to 
adopting and implementing AI, but it has not launched a new AI program in nearly a 
decade.11 For the past four years, DOD leadership spent countless hours developing 
potential use cases for AI, researching and piloting AI systems, and even putting out 
guidance to stop users from utilizing AI.12 But with limited widescale adoption. In contrast,

China is rapidly deploying AI systems and there could be serious consequences for 
United States national security should they lead on Generative AI and Agentic 
applications. 
 Fortunately, we still have time to catch up but the window is closing. To start, we must put 
in the foundational elements necessary to expand the use of AI programs. This starts with 
data. The DOD has long recognized the need to prioritize AI-ready data, even calling it a 
“national priorityˮ, but there has been little action taken to implement this priority.  
 
To truly prioritize and execute a strategy to have AI-ready data it requires two main 
aspects–AI-ready data requirements and enterprise-wide AI data infrastructure. As 
discussed above, China has recognized that winning on AI relies on a run-away data 
advantage. Last year alone, the DOD spent under $100 million on AI-ready data whereas 
China spent over $1 billion.13 The United States government is the worldʼs leading 
producer of both quantity and diverseness of data, but nearly all of this data is going 
unused with AI. If the US wants to turn our data into an advantage this must change.  
 
In parallel to implementing the requirement, the Department should also set up 
enterprise-wide AI data infrastructure. This commercial best practice ensures that AI 
programs are developed in the most efficient and cost effective manner. The leading tech 
companies have long realized this requirement for effectiveness and for that reason China 
is mirroring the same approach. To date, the Department of Defense has not yet taken the 
steps necessary to put in place this capability in a meaningful way.  
 Once the right data foundation is in place, the government must also look to build out an 
AI strategy that will best position the United States to win. In order for this to occur, Scale 
believes that this should focus on Agentic Applications such as Agentic Warfare. This 
would provide a “top right of the curveˮ vision and enable a tangible multi-year plan to 
reach it.  
 
Agentic warfare presents the best opportunity for the United States to build asymmetric 
advantages given that it will eventually be able to complement humanʼs ability to process 
information. For example, AI Agents could drastically improve the intelligence gathering 
process by constantly monitoring for new information and immediately relaying that 
information to a human overseer. This example is possible today and would provide 
immediate impact. Scale is actively working on deploying the first instance of this14, but if 
the United States wants to beat China this approach must be implemented through the 
entirety of the Department of Defense and Government writ large.

If we want to win, we must not only buy into a vision, but also start to take clear and 
decisive actions on it. 
 
P ila r  F o ur : In n o v a t e  – Scale has long been vocal proponents of the idea that the right 
regulatory framework is one that maximizes innovation, but still creates proper guardrails. 
For the United States to continue to be the most attractive place for leading tech 
companies to develop the next generation of cutting edge AI systems, it relies on 
ensuring the best environment for them to do so. 
 This should start by reaffirming President Trump ʼs previous commitment15 to a 
sector-specific and use-cased base regulatory framework which rightly governs the use 
of the technology instead of the technology itself. Furthermore, this approach focuses on 
governing outputs and mirrors how we have always governed technology. For example, a 
laptop can be used for a number of different purposes including enabling research and 
connectivity but it can be also used for hacking. However, we do not regulate the laptop, 
we regulate the malicious use of said laptop. This is the same approach the US should 
confirm for AI.   
However, to adequately implement this approach the US must ensure that our regulatory 
system is sufficient for AI. AI will be the most ubiquitous technology of our time and will 
be used in every industry. Therefore, the US government needs a thorough understanding 
of where gaps may be in the regulatory system. In order to best determine this, Scale 
strongly supports the Administration conducting a comprehensive regulatory gap analysis 
which would highlight if one exists. If shown to exist, actions must be taken to provide 
regulatory consistency. 
 
Finally, the US private sector and government must start to look at how we can all support 
and build the workforce of the future in the United States. AI is still relatively new, and 
much like coding in the 1990s, acquiring the skills necessary to train, fine tune, and 
evaluate AI systems will be vital in the future. These skillsets did not exist a decade ago, 
but are already proving to be large drivers of economic activity.  
 
For example, in 2024, Scale had hundreds of thousands of people around the world doing 
flexible, side-hustle work on our marketplace platforms and were compensated nearly 
$500 million collectively. In the United States specifically, there are people in over 9,000 
unique cities and towns doing this type of flexible AI work. In the coming years, as AI 
continues to develop, we believe that this type of work will generate billions of economic 
output.

If our nation wants to build the highest quality AI systems in the United States, they must 
be trained by people in the United States. U.S. tech companies should be central in 
building the workforce of the future right here in the United States, consistent with 
President Trumpʼs priorities regarding American job creation and American AI leadership. 
To make this a reality, the Administration should advance regulatory policies that promote 
the new work opportunities that companies like Scale are pioneering in the AI 
economy–work opportunities that are critical to Americaʼs AI success against the real and 
imminent threat of China ʼs AI initiatives, and promote the AI upskilling of the American 
workforce by incentivizing business activities that enable workers to transfer their 
pre-existing credentials, skills and competencies to the AI economy. 
Conclusion 
Over the past few years, no topic has captivated the world like AI, and it ʼs indisputable 
that AI is one of the most, if not the most, important technological innovation of the 
century. The next four years will be critical in determining whether or not the United 
States will lead the world in the development, deployment, and export of this technology. 
China is determined to be the global standard for AI, and itʼs imperative that the US does 
not let this happen. 
President Trump has rightly committed to leading the world, and now is the time for bold 
action. Scale looks forward to working with the Trump Administration to do just that.
