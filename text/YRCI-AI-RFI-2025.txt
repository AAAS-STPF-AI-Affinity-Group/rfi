2.Reimagining Federal government Human Capital: AI -Driven Workfor ce
Transformation
The federal workforce is the backbone of government operations, yet the hiring and talent management processes that support it remain slow, rigid, and misaligned with modern workforce demands. As agencies strive to meet evolving mission objectives, they must navigate outdated policies that delay hiring, limit access to top talent, and create efficiencies in workforce planning. The need for transformation is clear: 
federal HR must evolve to be faster, smarter, and more adaptive to the needs of both agencies and job 
seekers.  
YRCI is a forward -thinking federal government contractor dedicated to reimagining HR processes by 
leveraging emerging technologies and data -driven strategies. With deep expertise in federal hiring and 
workforce development, YRCI understands the structural and procedural barriers that agencies face when 
recruiting, onboarding, and managing employees. Our approach is rooted in solving  federal HR complexity  
through automation, artificial intelligence  (AI), and streamlined policy frameworks that reduce 
administrative burden while improving hiring outcomes.  
By embracing AI, federal agencies have an opportunity to unlock efficiencies that will accelerate hiring timelines, enhance applicant assessments, and improve workforce agility. However, to realize AI’s full potential in HR, policymakers must rethink existing regulatory constraints and create an environment where AI-driven tools can complement human decision- making. The responsible application of AI in federal hiring 
can lead to a more transparent  and effective  workforce while maintaining the integrity of merit- based hiring 
principles.  
YRCI’s response to the AI Action Plan  Request for Information (RFI ) outlines concrete policy actions that 
will enable AI- driven transformation in federal HR. Our recommendations focus on optimizing AI 
application in hiring, ensuring explainability in AI -driven decisions, investing in AI research for HR 
innovation, upskill ing the federal workforce to operate AI systems effectively, and establishing policies that 
safeguard AI -generated workforce data. Each of these areas represents a critical step in modernizing federal 
HR and positioning agencies to meet their workforce challenges with agility and confidence.  
As a trusted partner in federal HR modernization, YRCI is committed to working alongside policymakers, agency leaders, and technology innovators to drive meaningful change. We believe the federal government has a unique opportunity to set the standard for AI-enabled workforce management, and our 


recommendations provide a strategic path forward. Through thoughtful policy adjustments and targeted 
investments, AI can serve as a powerful tool to enhance federal HR operations, making them more efficient, effective,  and future -ready.  
To drive meaningful change in federal workforce management, agencies must adopt policies that fully embrace AI’s ability to redefine hiring, workforce planning, and employee development. AI presents an unprecedented opportunity to transform HR operations b y automating complex processes, accelerating 
decision -making, and optimizing workforce strategies. By leveraging AI’s capabilities to the fullest extent, 
federal agencies can unlock efficiencies that significantly reduce hiring timelines, enhance candidate  
assessments, and streamline workforce management at scale.  
YRCI recognizes that AI is poised to fundamentally reshape the way federal HR functions. Traditional hiring and talent management processes are built around manual workflows that introduce delays, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies. AI -driven systems can analyze vast amounts of workforce data, identify top talent in real 
time, and automate key decision points to ensure a highly responsive, adaptable federal workforce. As AI continues to evolve, the opportunity to optimize and, in some cases, fully automate  aspects of HR will drive 
significant gains in operational efficiency and mission readiness.  
To fully capitalize on AI’s potential, agencies must adopt forward -leaning policies that enable AI to take on 
a more autonomous role in federal HR , enhancing human productivity and creativity, while ensuring 
transparency, oversight, and security. By moving beyond outdated regulatory constraints, the government 
can position itself at the forefront of AI- driven HR transformation, maximizing automation where feasible 
and allowing AI to execute workforce decisions with precision. Strategic investments in AI research, 
workforce upskilling, and policy modernization will be critical to fostering a truly AI- enabled government 
workforce.  
To support this transformation, YRCI proposes targeted AI policy actions across five key areas  highlighted 
in the AI Action Plan RFI: 
1.Application and Use of AI in Federal HR
2.Explainability and Assurance of AI Model Outputs
3.Research and Development for AI in HR
4.Education and Workforce Development
5.Intellectual Property and AI- Enabled HR Systems
The following sections outline specific policy recommendations in each of these areas, detailing how AI can be fully leveraged to accelerate HR processes, improve workforce outcomes, and establish a modern federal workforce that is optimized for speed, acc uracy, and adaptability.  
3. AI Application and Use in Federal HR
3.1 Current Challenges
The federal hiring process is constrained by rigid policies that create inefficiencies in talent acquisition, security processing, and workforce classification. The traditional hiring model often fails to keep pace with evolving mission needs, resulting in delayed recruitment, inconsistent application of hiring rules, and a lack 
of flexibility in workforce planning. AI has the potential to optimize hiring pipelines, standardize 
classification systems, and streamline security clearances, but existing regulations must be updated to fully 
unlock AI’s benefits.  


•Public notice requirements (5 U.S.C. §§ 3327 and 3330)  impose fixed timelines for job postings
before selections can be made, preventing agencies from using AI -driven pre -screening and
automated candidate evaluations  to accelerate hiring. The inability to assess applicants in real time
increases delays for hiring managers, who must wait for the public notice period to expire before
reviewing applicants.
•The federal government has expanded the use of Shared Certificates  to increase hiring flexibility;
however, policies governing shared certificates (5 CFR § 332.408)  still require consideration of
public notice and internal employee rights (5 CFR § 335), adding additional steps to the hiringprocess. While AI could help manage these complexities by automating eligibility verifications and
ranking candidates dynamically , current policies limit AI’s ability to streamline these actions.
•Classification policies (5 CFR 511) maintain rigid job series structures  that do not align with AI -
driven skills -based hiring models. The manual process of determining occupational classification
contributes to delays and inconsistencies when hiring for new or evolving roles. AI could be
leveraged to analyze major duty statements, assess classification benchmarks, and recommendproper series and grades  more efficiently than traditional methods.
•Veterans’ Preference rules (5 CFR 211, 332, and 337.304)  require manual adjudication  of veteran
status and ranking preferences, introducing risks of human error, subjectivity, and processing delays .
AI-driven hiring automation could accurately validate veterans’ documentation  in real -time and
ensure compliance with ranking regulations  while reducing administrative burden.
•Security and suitability policies (5 CFR 731 and 732) introduce inefficiencies in background checks
due to duplicative clearance processes across agencies. Many agencies lack a centralized AI -
powered adjudication system, resulting in delays, redundant investigations, and inconsistencies in
risk assessments. AI -based clearance adjudication would increase accuracy, expedite security
processing, and enable real -time reciprocity  across federal agencies and save the government money.
•The USA Staffing  talent acquisition system current ly restricts hiring flexibility  through process-
driven requirements that lack AI -enhanced customization . Agencies cannot easily tailor hiring
processes to fit mission needs, limiting AI’s role in adaptive hiring strategies, candidate ranking, and
applicant tracking enhancements .
•The federal government currently operates multiple pay scales and pay bands  developed over the
last 50 years (5 CFR Part 530 -550). These fragmented systems pose challenges in salary translation
and hinder workforce mobility. AI -driven pay conversion tools could create a standardized
framework  that improves salary consistency across agencies while simplifying pay band transitions .
3.2 Proposed AI -Driven Policy Actions 
To fully integrate AI into federal HR, policymakers must focus on modernizing regulations to allow AI to accelerate hiring timelines, enhance classification accuracy, and improve workforce adaptability. The following policy actions would enable AI -driven hiring and workforce management while maintaining 
compliance with federal merit principles.  
•Amend public notice rules (5 U.S.C. §§ 3327 and 3330) to allow AI -driven pre -screening and
automated candidate assessments during the public notice period. AI tools can identify top
candidates as applications are received, significantly reducing time -to-hire without compromising
merit- based competition.


• Modernize classification systems (5 CFR 511) by implementing AI- driven competency assessments 
and using AI to review major duty statements and recommend classifications based on federal 
standards.  
• AI could be leveraged in classification desk audits and appeals by conducting automated interviews 
and preliminary classification analyses, streamlining the review process.  
• Automate veterans’ preference adjudication (5 CFR 211, 332, and 337.304) by developing AI -based 
verification tools that instantly validate veteran eligibility, apply ranking rules, and identify 
anomalies, ensuring transparent, merit -based applications while reducing manual errors. 
o Streamline security clearance adjudication (5 CFR 731 and 732) by consolidating background check processes into an AI -powered federal security database, which could  
Automate identity verification using real- time government data sources.  
o Detect and flag discrepancies before human adjudication, reducing the need for redundant reviews.  
o Leverage federal reciprocity agreements to allow AI- driven risk assessments across agencies, 
eliminating duplicate investigations.  
• Use AI to model and simulate the impact of policy changes on the federal hiring process in real time by analyzing historical hiring data and predicting potential bottlenecks before they arise. AI -driven 
policy simulations would allow proactive adjustments to HR regulations, ensuring continuous hiring process improvement.  
• Develop an AI -driven conversion system (5 CFR Part 530 -550) to create a standardized salary 
translation framework, which would:  
o Convert pay rates between GS, WG, and alternative pay systems in real time.  
o Align pay bands with AI -driven labor market analysis to ensure competitive federal 
compensation.  
o Facilitate salary harmonization for cross- agency transfers, improving workforce mobility 
and hiring flexibility.

4.Explainability and Assurance of AI Model Outputs
4.1 Current Challenges
Federal hiring policies emphasize transparency and accountability, but the integration of AI into hiring and 
workforce management introduces challenges related to explainability and oversight. While AI has the 
potential to enhance efficiency and decision accuracy, agencies must ensure that AI -driven tools align with 
federal hiring regulations  and can be audited for compliance.  
•Merit System Principles (5 U.S.C. § 2301)  require transparent and explainable hiring practices , but
AI models often operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand or challenge AI -driven
decisions . Without clear AI explainability requirements, agencies may struggle to justify hiring
selections or address applicant concerns.
•Rating and reconsideration processes (5 CFR 300.104)  place responsibility for rating errors on the
examining office or rater, requiring manual intervention even in cases where AI -driven models
provide more consistent and unbiased assessments. The current lack of AI integration in rating
reconsideration  means that errors must be manually reviewed, extending the hiring process .
•Labor -related issues (5 CFR Part 7101 -9701)  are currently handled exclusively by human personnel ,
which can introduce inconsistency  when addressing workforce disputes. AI could provide objective,
policy- based decision support  in resolving labor issues while maintaining compliance with federal
labor regulations.
•No Fear Act compliance monitoring  is largely manual and reactive, creating delays and transparency
gaps in how workplace concerns are tracked and addressed. AI -driven compliance monitoring could
detect potential irregularities  early  and improve reporting accuracy.
The application of AI in delegated examining (DE) activities  presents both opportunities and challenges  
within the framework of federal personnel management policy. Under 5 U.S.C. § 1104, agencies must have 
delegated authority to conduct competitive examinations , and OPM maintains oversight to ensure 
compliance with civil service laws and merit system principles (5 U.S.C. §§ 1103(a)(5), 1104(b)(1) -(2), and 
2301) . This requirement presents barriers to AI implementation , as agencies would need explicit 
authorization to integrate AI- driven assessments into ex amining processes. Additionally, since not all 
agencies have delegated examining authority, AI -driven hiring tools or resume repositories could face 
government -wide implementation challenges  due to inconsistent examination procedures across agencies. 
4.2 Proposed AI -Driven Policy Actions 
To ensure AI -driven hiring and workforce management remain transparent, accountable, and aligned with 
federal regulations, policymakers should implement clear guidelines for AI explainability and compliance monitoring. The following policy actions would es tablish trust and oversight mechanisms while enabling 
AI-driven efficiency improvements.  
•Mandate AI hiring models to generate human- readable justifications for every hiring decision,
ensuring AI -generated recommendations can be reviewed and understood in accordance with 5
U.S.C. § 2301.


• Establish a standardized AI auditing framework (5 CFR 300.104) to ensure AI -driven assessments 
comply with merit- based hiring principles , including detection mechanisms in place before 
deployment.  
• Develop an AI -driven compliance monitoring system (5 CFR 300.104) that continuously scans 
hiring patterns, rating determinations, and reconsideration cases to detect potential inconsistencies.  
• Introduce an AI ethics review board within OPM to oversee AI -based hiring systems, ensuring they 
align with federal hiring policies . Create an AI -driven virtual assistant for labor- related issues (5 
CFR Part 7101 -9701) to provide objective assessments of workforce disputes, conduct cases, and 
labor -management relations, ensuring faster and more consistent resolution processes.  
Additionally, AI presents a significant opportunity to enhance certification and recertification processes for 
delegated examining unit staff. Instead of requiring personnel to complete OPM training followed by 
proctored testing, AI could be leveraged to:  
• Automate knowledge assessments with adaptive testing tailored to individual competency levels, ensuring faster and more precise delegated examining unit certifications . 
• Provide real -time feedback and targeted learning modules, allowing examiners to stay up to date 
with changing federal hiring policies.  
• Monitor compliance by analyzing decision patterns and flagging inconsistencies with OPM hiring 
standards.  
o AI systems could serve dual purposes by scanning existing policies and suggesting 
improvements based on evolving workforce trends. 
• Streamline the recertification process, reducing administrative burdens while maintaining rigorous oversight to ensure continued compliance with OPM’s hiring mandates.  
4.3 YRCI’s Role

7.Intellectual Property and AI -Enabled HR Systems
7.1 Current Challenges
As AI continues to play a larger role in federal HR functions, agencies must address the issue of data 
ownership, transparency, and interoperability . AI-generated HR data, ranging from automated hiring 
assessments to workforce analytics and predictive models, raises important questions about who controls, 
stores, and accesses this data. Without clear policies, federal agencies risk losing control of critical HR 
information , becoming dependent on proprietary AI vendors , and limiting the government’s ability to adapt 
AI systems to evolving workforce needs . 
•Unclear ownership of AI -generated HR data and hiring assessments creates potential vendor lock-
in. Many AI -driven hiring platforms and workforce analytics tools are built and maintained by
private -sector vendors  using proprietary algorithms and data structures . If agencies do not retain
clear ownership of AI -generated workforce data, they risk being tied to a specific vendor’s ecosystem
without the flexibility to migrate data or modify AI models  to meet government priorities.
•Proprietary AI hiring tools lack transparency, limiting interoperability across agencies.  Many
existing AI hiring solutions operate as closed systems, meaning agencies cannot fully audit or modify
AI-driven recommendations . Without transparency into AI model training data, bias mitigation
techniques, and decision -making processes, agencies cannot ensure merit -based hiring practices or
align AI -driven workforce solutions with federal merit principles .
The future of AI in federal HR depends on establishing policies that protect government ownership of AI -
generated workforce data, mandate transparency in AI hiring solutions, and create open architectures for cross- agency interoperability . Without these safeguards, agencies will face long- term risks in data control., 
workforce intelligence, and hiring fairness . 
7.2 Proposed AI -Driven Policy Actions 
To ensure federal agencies retain control over AI -driven HR data and solutions , policymakers must 
implement clear guidelines for AI data ownership, transparency, and interoperability. The following policy 
actions will prevent vendor lock- in, enhance AI explainability, and promote innovation in AI -enabled HR 
systems: 
•Define AI -generated HR data as federal property , ensuring the government retains control over AI-
generated hiring assessments, workforce analytics, and decision -making models . This policy will
prevent data monopolization by private vendors  and enable agencies to adapt AI solutions to mission
needs  without external restrictions.
•Mandate open -source AI solutions for HR, allowing agencies to integrate AI tools without vendor
dependency . By requiring AI -driven hiring and workforce management platforms to use open
architectures , agencies can standardize AI hiring processes, ensure data interoperability, and
maintain flexibility in future AI system upgrades .


• Require AI model builders to disclose training data sources and biases, ensuring full transparency in 
AI-based hiring. Vendors must provide clear documentation on how AI models are trained, what 
data sources are used, and what bias -mitigation techniques are applied , allowing agencies to audit 
AI decision -making and maintain compliance with federal hiring regulations . 
• Incorporate microservice architecture and integrations for agile and dynamic interactions and 
transactions.  AI-driven HR platforms should be modular and API -driven , enabling agencies to 
integrate AI hiring tools with existing HR systems  while maintaining data portability and 
adaptability . 
• Produce “trust” sites summarizing generative AI output and content with anonymized data across 
HR functions (i.e., hiring, onboarding, benefits , etc.). These trust sites would provide transparency 
dashboards , allowing agencies to review AI -generated recommendations, track workforce trends, 
and assess AI -driven hiring decisions  to ensure accuracy  and consistency . 
• Establish guidelines for neural network capabilities in a decentralized, open network environment to further prevent vendor lock- in. Agencies should implement federal AI governance standards that 
ensure neural networks used in hiring assessments and workforce analytics  can operate 
independently of specific vendors  while maintaining consistency and compliance across agencies. 
• Launch a shared community to permit development of new services based on the above framework and what is “centralized” across it.  This initiative would create an AI HR innovation ecosystem , 
allowing agencies to collaborate on AI -driven workforce solutions, share best practices, and co -
develop AI tools that align with government -wide HR objectives . 
By implementing these policy actions , federal agencies will establish a secure, transparent, and government -
controlled AI HR ecosystem, ensuring long- term adaptability and data integrity .

8.Building a future -ready A I Enabled Federal Workforce
The integration of AI into federal HR represents a paradigm shift in workforce management, offering 
unparalleled opportunities to enhance hiring efficiency, optimize workforce planning, and improve decision-making. However, realizing AI’s full potential requires a policy framework that supports innovation, ensures transparency, and fosters workforce adaptability. The federal government has an opportunity to lead the way in AI -driven HR transformation, but this will require bold action, strategic investment,  and regulatory 
modernization. YRCI urges policymakers to take a proactive approach in shaping AI policies that accelerate HR innovation while ensuring merit- based, secur e, and accountab le hiring practices .  
The first critical step is to remove regulatory barriers that are slowing AI adoption. Many existing federal hiring and workforce management policies were designed for manual processes, creating roadblocks to implementing AI- driven efficiencies. Public notice requirements, classification structures, and security 
clearance policies must be updated to allow AI -driven tools to accelerate hiring timelines and reduce 
administrative burden. Without these reforms, agencies will continue to grapple with outdated processes that limit their ability to attract and retain top talent. Streamlining hiring regulations will enable AI to create a more agile, responsive federal workforce that can adapt to evolving mission needs.  
Equally important is ensuring that AI- driven hiring prevents algorithmic bias and remains  explainable and 
aligned with federal merit principles. AI’s ability to automate candidate assessments, match skills to job requirements, and analyze workforce data must be balanced with policies that mandate transparency, prevent bias, and maintain accountability. Establishing AI auditing frameworks, explainability standards, and ethics 
oversight boards will ensure that AI models are interpretable, justifiable, and free from unintended irregularities . YRCI supports AI policies that preserve the integrity of the federal hiring process while 
leveraging AI’s analytical power to enhance decision -making.  
Beyond hiring, investment in AI HR research, workforce upskilling, and AI infrastructure will be key to long- term success. AI is not just a tool for automation, it is a strategic enabler of workforce intelligence, 
career development, and operational effici ency. Policymakers must prioritize funding for AI- driven HR 
innovations, ensuring agencies have access to state -of-the-art AI tools, training programs, and cross -agency 
AI collaboration platforms. Additionally, equipping federal employees with AI literacy and training will be essential in ensuring AI solutions are effectively managed, monitored, and optimized. A skilled, AI- ready 
workforce will be the foundation of a future -proof government.  
By embracing these policy recommendations, the federal government can build a future -ready, AI -enabled 
workforce that is efficient, agile, and capable of meeting the evolving needs of the American public. YRCI stands ready to lead this transformation, bringing expertise in federal HR modernization, AI- driven hiring 
solutions, and workforce development. Through strategic partnerships, innovative HR solutions, and deep policy expertise, YRCI is committed to helping federal agencies harness the power of AI to revolutionize 
human capital management. The time for action is now;  by modernizing policies, fostering AI innovation, 
and investing in workforce capabilities, federal HR can enter a new era of efficien t and effective 
technological excellence.
