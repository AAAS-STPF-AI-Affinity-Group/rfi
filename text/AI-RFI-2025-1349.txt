EU-US collaboration  
AI models have an inherently global reach , with value chains that are globally 
integrated. It is therefore important to foster an interoperable approach to AI 
governance, focusing on common standards and terminology whilst  respecting 
existing regulatory frameworks. Transatlantic collaboration on AI development is 
crucial for ensuring mutual economic growth and technological leadership  vis-à-
vis other geographies . 
To continue developing the EU -US partnership, DIGITALEUROPE proposes the 
creation of an EU -US Critical and Dual -Use Technology Council, leveraging our 
combined strength in the tech sector. The Council should advance coordination on 
critical technologies like AI and cybersecurity, starting with dual -use applications, 
whilst  enhancing the protection of our critical infrastructure through collaboration 
on data transfer and the development of international standards.2 
Both the EU and US have announced significant investments in AI , with the EU’s 
‘InvestAI’ and the US ‘Stargate .’ Going forward, it will be crucial to maintain a 
dialogue on these investment initiatives, to establish effective communication 
channels as the program mes take shape. This is one of the topics where an EU -
US Critical and Dual -Use Tech Council would provide real value.  
2 Over the past years, DIGITALEUROPE has been engaged in the EU -US Trade and Technology 
Council (TTC), publishing recommendations for , and participating in , TTC ministerial meetings.  


3 
Lastly, DIGITALEUROPE encourages international collaboration amongst  AI 
institutes . Coordinated efforts will help align research, testing  and guidance on AI . 
G7 for global AI alignment  
Next to bilateral EU -US cooperation, alignment with like -minded partners in the G7 
is of paramount importance. As we reiterated in the Tech7 key recommendations  
for the AI Action Summit in Paris,3 G7 countries should work together to develop 
an interoperable, risk -based  and consensus -driven approach to AI governance. 
DIGITALEUROPE supports the promotion of shared AI guidelines that can be 
adopted on a global scale on a voluntary and flexible basis.4 
Export controls  on AI advanced chips  
The export control measures on advanced AI chips introduced by the previous US 
administration treat EU Member States unequally , and have created tensions in 
the transatlantic partnership.  
Rather than introducing restrictive measures, the focus should be on fostering 
collaboration on mutual priorities. Both the EU and the US depend on one another 
for security and to remain competitive. This interdependence should be seen as a 
strength. As we  highlighted in our recent statement, the EU  as a whole must remain 
a trusted ally for the US .5 
Standards  
Standards play a strategic role in the uptake of new emerging digital technologies  
–such as AI, quantum , the metaverse  and 6G – and in digital ising our econom ies
and societ ies. Furthermore, standards can mitigate risks from exploitation of digital
solutions, tools and products by malevolent actors.
The global standardi sation  of digital technologies is arguably even more critical  – 
and more complex  – than the standardi sation  of physical attributes  such as 
electromagnetic compatibility, safety and radio. Several key factors must  be 
considered .

First, digital products such as AI usually have a much greater need of global 
interoperability than physical products. For full utilisation , interoperability and 
interconnectedness, globally accepted standards are vital (e.g . free data flow 
across borders) to increase choice, whilst decreasing costs for consumers. Digital 
products are almost always developed for global use.  
Additionally, as digital products need to be globally interoperable, it is important to 
have all relevant and knowledgeable stakeholders included in the standard isation  
process, including international businesses.  
Finally, digital products change very frequently, with some of them going through 
a nearly continuous development (‘DevOps ’). Therefore, there is a need to take de 
facto  standard isation  into account. Consensus -based standard isation  and de facto  
standard isation  will both be important – today and for the future . 
Collaboration for AI use in critical infrastructure  
Protecting critical infrastructure is a key component of a complete defence  
strategy. We encourage the development of AI -focused frameworks to minim ise 
threats that might disrupt critical infrastructure such as energy and food production, 
water management, transportation  and health care, amongst  others.  
Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic must advance policies that support the 
integration of AI in critical infrastructure, enabling innovation and securing key 
sectors against various threats, including cyber. Such policies should encompass 
robust framew orks that priorit ise the security and resilience of essential services, 
including energy, transportation  and healthcare. For example, strengthening 
transatlantic cooperation on health will be instrumental in advancing research 
efforts to combat pandemics a nd diseases whilst  addressing interoperability and 
security challenges.  
By fostering AI adoption in these sectors, policymakers can ensure that the EU 
and US not only safeguard their critical infrastructure but also set a global standard 
for AI -driven innovation. This concerted effort will necessitate comprehensive 
legislation  that promotes investment in AI technologies, encourages public -private 
partnerships  and ensures regulatory alignment to facilitate seamless collaboration 
and knowledge sharing.  
Further AI -enabled cybersecurity collaboration between the EU and the US is vital 
for safeguarding critical infrastructure against an ever -evolving landscape of 
threats. By working together, both regions can leverage their combined expertise 
and resources to develop robust defence  mechanisms that protect essential 
services such as energy, transportation  and healthcare. Enhanced cooperation 
regarding  the benefits of AI in cybersecurity , along with the threats , can lead to the 
exchange of best practices, real -time threat intelligence  and coordinated 


5 
responses to cyber -attacks, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and ensuring the 
resilience of critical systems. This collective effort not only strengthens the security 
of individual nations but also establishes a unified front that sets global standards 
for cybersecurity in critical infrastructure, ultimately promoting stability and trust in 
the international community . 
Defence  collaboration  
Transatlantic AI cooperation is essential in enhancing cybersecurity, operational 
efficiency  and technological leadership in defence . To advance these objectives, 
DIGITALEUROPE recommends a number of key initiatives.  
First, fostering EU -US collaboration on dual -use technologies is essential. 
Ensuring interoperability between AI -powered defence  applications across EU and 
NATO partners would enhance collective security and operation effectiveness.6 
Second, AI should be integrated into cyber resilience strategies for defence . 
Accelerating AI adoption in predictive maintenance, logistics  and real-time 
battlefield analytics would enhance military readiness. Furthermore, supporting AI -
driven cybersecurity solutions, military networks  and cloud -based command 
systems is essential to all NATO allies. 
Third, investment in AI applications in defence  must be priorit ised. 
DIGITALEUROPE calls for the allocation of 25  per cent  of NATO institutional funds 
to AI -driven defence  innovation and digital resilience. In the same vein, 
simplification of procurement processes and an increase in SME participation in 
AI-driven defence  projects would foster innovation and strengthen the tech 
ecosystem in defence . 
Additionally, addressing the AI skills gap in defence  is critical. Expanding AI and 
cybersecurity training program mes for military and industry personnel will ensure 
a skilled workforce on both sides of the Atlantic.  
Finally, whilst  the EU AI Act does not regulate military applications, ethical 
considerations remain a key factor in AI for defence . Ensuring human oversight in 
AI-powered decision -making, particularly in autonomous systems and combat 
simulations, is essential to uphold international humanitarian law and prevent 
unintended escalation. The US should work closely with the EU to develop AI 
safety frameworks and ethical guidelines within the proposed EU -US Critical and

Dual-Use Technology Council, ensuring responsible AI deployment whilst  
fostering innovation and operational effectiveness.  
Conclusions  
DIGITALEUROPE remains committed to the advancement of AI development 
through EU -US and international cooperation. A transatlantic approach that aligns 
regulatory frameworks and fosters innovation will strengthen our collective ability 
to harness AI’s trans formative potential, notably in accelerating our defence  
collaboration and strengthening the security of critical infrastructure.  
By working together, the EU, US and partners can establish a robust AI ecosystem 
that supports innovation, economic prosperity  and societal wellbeing. 
DIGITALEUROPE is ready to support with further input, as we have done over the 
last years and remains ready to support the establishment of an EU -US Critical 
and Dual -Use Tech nology  Council to advance these shared priorities.
