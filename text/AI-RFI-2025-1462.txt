Doug Hohulin RFI Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan


Page 1 March 15, 2025  
Response to RFI pm the “ Development of an AI Action Plan ” Regulations.gov  
Dear OSTP Team,  
I am Doug Hohulin  President/Founder  of Exponential Blueprint Consulting LLC . I work on AI 
projects “When the AI System Has to Be Right"  AI in Healthcare,  Regulation , Governance , 
Policy,  Road Safety/A V , Education  and Energy , Co-Author of  2030: A Blueprint for Humanity's 
Exponential Leap   2030Book.org Website  and Tech  Powered  Healing: The Future of Medicine in 
the AI Age  and consultant for  various companies including  AI & Partners  that provides an AI 
governance platform and AI literacy training that enables responsible use of AI.   I am working on 
how to use AI to make America and t he World Healthy - Saving 1 Billion Lives - Reducing 
Disabilities  - by Empowering Patients & Clinicians With AI .  
I support the priority policy actions needed to sustain and enhance America's AI dominance, and 
to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI 
innovation.  AI is a powerful tool that if used properly can be used to unlock trillions of dollars of 
economic value and productivity  to the US and the world. But this powerful tool can be costly if 
not used properly.  In 2012, the Knight Capital Group suffered a $440  million loss within ~30 
minutes due to a malfunctioning algorithm.  One of t he largest HIPAA settlements  was $16 
million paid by Anthem, Inc. in 2018, following a cyberattack that exposed the electronic 
protected health information of ~79 million individuals.  The use of AI could open the door for 
future cyberattack  and exposing sensitive /proprietary  information that could expose companies 
to even greater fines  or liability .  
As humanity uses AI to be our agents, companies  must  ensure they understand the opportunities, 
risks and benefits. Companies and individuals must know  their liability (under current law and 
potential future laws) as they deploy these AI agents  and tools . NTIA released the  AI 
Accountability Policy Report  offering policy recommendations to help support safe, secure, and 
trustworthy AI innovation.   ISO/IEC 42001:2023 and the  EU AI Act provide  risk assessment 
guidelines that can be used to minimize r isk and liability to a company  – especially if they 
operate in areas outside the Un ited States . 
In December 2024, t he Bipartisan  House  Task Force releases report on  AI innovation   (AI-
Task-Force -Report -FINAL.pdf ), the report highlighted differ ent problems Americans and 
Industry faces  and discussed ways AI and AI Policy could be used  to solve the problems .   Two 
problems highlight ed. 
•Treatment Errors (Rx)  2 Million Affected  >250,000 Harmed  Costs ~ $20 Billion/Year
•Diagnostic Errors (Dx)  Most Common  Over  12 Million Affected,  Most
Catastrophic  Estimated  4 Million Harmed;  Most Costly  Estimated  > $100 Billion/Year


Page 2 Paul Barach, B.Med.Sci, MD, MPH, Maj (Ret.), AUA  gave a recent presentation that highlighted 
the following problems in healthcare.  
•“1 in 10 patients have poor quality and harmed in hospital care/ between 5.7 and 8.4
million deaths occurring annually from poor quality care  (Up to 8 Million Deaths Occur
in Low - and Middle -Income Countries Yearly Due to Poor -Quality Health Care, Says
New Report | National Academies )
•20-40% health spending wasted due to poor quality of care and safety failures
•15% of hospital costs being due to patient harms caused by adverse events ”
As I wrote in the book 2030: A Blueprint for Humanity's Exponential Leap , “Dr. Jordan Shlain 
stated, “Healthcare at its best is a conversation between a doctor and a patient trying to solve a 
problem." To be useful, AI must be harnessed to enhance the patient -doctor relationship (not 
replace it), improve preventative care, and  address the modifiable risk factors that lead to chronic 
disease and early mortality.  What if we can have an AI Health Coach to motivate us daily to 
work on helping us follow our clinician’s specified treatment plans ?  Fifty percent  of people do 
not follow their treatment plans.”  
“The National health expenditures (NHE) are unsustainable. New solutions are required to solve 
the challenges of Avoiding Avoidable Deaths and the cost of Healthcare.  The National Health 
Expenditure Projections, 2023 –32: Payer Trends Diverge As Pandemic -Related Policies Fade | 
Health Affairs   By Jacqueline A. Fiore , 
“Health care spending growth is expected to outpace that of the gross domestic product (GDP) 
during the coming decade, resulting in a health share of GDP that reaches 19.7  percent by 2032 
(up from 17.3  percent in 2022). National health expenditures are proj ected to have grown 
7.5 percent in 2023 when the COVID -19 public health emergency ended .”  The report provides a 
summary of healthcare spending.

Any AI Action Plan should be evaluated on how well “The Plan ” helps the healthcare 
industry solve s the Treatment Errors (Rx) and Diagnostic Errors (Dx ), encourages the use 
of AI to enhance the patient -doctor relationship (not replace it)  and lower the cost of 
healthcare  while providing high quality care.  
The MIT A Risk Repository is an AI Incident Tracker  – the “ visualization shows how incidents 
of harm from AI reported in the  AI Incident Database  are increasing over time, with the greatest 
increase in incidents associated with the Misinformation and Malicious Actors domains from the 
MIT AI Risk Repository. ”  “The Plan” should be measured by how well it reduces harm and 
incidents like these while helping innovation.  
As highlighted by the following surveys, AI is still limited in how it is being deployed in the 
workplace and by the Clinician s. 
•U.S. Workers Are More Worried Than Hopeful About Future AI Use in the Workplace
| Pew Research Center
•AI Is in the Doctor’s Bag —And Primary Care Is Ready to Use It | Rock Health
“You see the computer revolution everywhere except  the productivity  statistics.”  - Robert Solow 
1987 . The question is when will the US see innovation and productivity  gains from AI and how 
can The Plan maximize these gains?  
I support the Establishing the President's Make America Healthy Again Commission – The White 
House  but this order did not reference using AI to help support this order.  AI could be a 
powerful  tool to help “Make America Healthy Again .” 
To enhance America's AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements 
do not hamper private sector AI innovation. The following areas should be considered : 
•Encourage specific industry AI self -regulation .
•Encourage industry self -risk assessment to help companies innovate  to solve problems
but also deploy safe and effective AI. Encourage companies to l everage NTIA, ISO/IEC
42001:2023 and the EU AI Act risk assessment guidelines  and best practices .
•US Government policy , regulations and laws should  support innovation while helping
companies minimize risk.  Any new policies, regulations and any new laws must balance
innovation , risk and liabilities.


Page 4 •Encourage companies to understand their liabilit ies when they use AI tools to minimize
their risk . Encourage industry to keep an expert human in the loop to monitor and control
the AI agent to make sure it does not cause harm.”
•Encourage AI Literacy  to companies and the American public  so that all Americans can
benefit from AI Innovation.
•Leverage AI to help “Make America Healthy Again.”
When I worked for Nokia, I created the North American Automated Vehicle/Connected Vehicle 
(A V/CV) strategy plan and for 4 years, I engaged in the A V/CV industry partners development as 
part of the  5GAA  (http://5gaa.org/ ) Business Models and Go -To-Market Strategies Working 
Group, FCC Task Force and the US Federal, State and Local Workstream leadership team.   In 
2016, I was on the editing teams for the  5GAA  and NGMN response to the US DOT/NHTSA 
V2V NPRM.  See the response  5GAA  comments  to the NHTSA on notice of proposed 
rulemaking - 5GAA .  I was part of the team that reviewed  the ~80 company / agency / key 
organization  responses. There were also ~400 individual responses from the public.   
I support  NSF and OSTP for the development of th is AI Plan that “ensure s an American Golden 
Age of technological innovation and economic prosperity. ”  I welcome the opportunity to engage  
with the administration to promote a responsible approach to AI that protects consumers and 
industry (by focusing on  minimizing risk and liability ) without stifling  innovation  and leverage 
AI to help “Make America Healthy Again.”
