General Comment
If there is a carve-out for generative AI to train on works and reproduce pieces of them  whole cloth there m ight as well be no copyright
law at all. Current and predicted future m odels can't even cite where the works cam e from . Current copyright law doesn't even allow you
claim  ownership of works produced by an AI, AI certainly should not be able to claim  ownership of the work of a hum an.
