I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the development of the AI Action Plan as 
required by Executive Order 14179, Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial 
Intelligence. Given the rapid advancements in AI and its increasing role in national security, 
economic competitiveness, and workforce transformation, I would like to highlight key priority 
areas in education and workforce development. To maintain U.S. leadership in AI, it is essential 
to build a skilled workforce that integrates AI expertise with cybersecurity, ethics, and public 
sector applications. I recommend the following policy actions: First, create new funding or 
increase funding for initiatives such as the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program 
to support AI -cybersecurity education, ensuring a pipeline of talent to protect AI -driven national 
infrastructure. Second, encourage federal and state investments in developing AI curricula that 
integrate cybersecurity, ethics, and adversarial AI defenses across K -12, undergraduate, and 
graduate levels. Third, support industry -academia partnerships to develop AI certification 
programs, providing opportunities for federal employees, veterans, and underrepresented groups 
to upskill in AI.
