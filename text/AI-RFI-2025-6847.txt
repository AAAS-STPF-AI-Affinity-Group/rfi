General Comment
None of what OpenAI uses to train its m odels is obtained with the consent of their original owners, and their use in training cannot be
defended by the fair use doctrine. It is unm istakably, definite theft, outright. Any im plem entation of laws protecting OpenAI and what they
do would violate innum erable copyright laws listed in the U.S. Code. Artists worried for the com prom ising of their work — which is an
overwhelm ing m ajority of them  — deserve at least the assurance that their work will not be stolen. Protect artists.
