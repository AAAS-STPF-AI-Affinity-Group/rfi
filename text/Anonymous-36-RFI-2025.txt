Everything about this is terrible. The administration is going to allow oligarchs to take advantage 
of labor continuously and endorse it. This is a transfer of wealth from the working class to the 
rich. “AI” which isn’t even accurately named needs incredib ly strict regulation in every sector 
for various reasons. The working class understand these concepts. The second Trump 
administration is totally untrustworthy if this continues and one by one we all know it. We aren’t 
stupid.
