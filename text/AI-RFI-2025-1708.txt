General Comment
Artificial Intelligence has a place within the world. It should benefit m ankind but not take the place of m ankind. Currently, entities that run
and own these AI com panies want to "train" their AI's on the blood, sweat and tears of artists and workers without perm ission. They want
to steal the collective output of hum anity, repackage it and spit it out to anyone who will pay them  for it. They have no right to do this.
This theft of work, experience and tim e can only hurt Am ericans. Many have already lost their jobs in the art industry. Greed has
prom pted m any com panies to fire their creative departm ents in favor of paying for AI output which in m any circum stances was based on
the work of their form er em ployees.
AI is also not a learning being "studying" content and basing new and original works of art or new creative output on any sort of
observation. These AI program s take in original works and cannot output without original works.
Again, this is a m atter of com panies trying to take work that does not belong to them  and offering no com pensation for it. They throw the
stolen content into an "AI Blender" and sell this output for profit. It is greedy. It is lazy. It is not Am erican. It is wrong. If these com panies
want "food" to feed their m achines then they should pay for the food like everyone else does- and only if this content is willingly for sale by
the real creators. This rape of hard workers for profit m ust be stopped. It m ust be condem ned. 
Thank you.
