General Comment
OpenAI is theft, pure and sim ple. If they are allowed to function by using copyright-protected m aterial without paying appropriately to the
rights-holders IT IS THEFT. 
If this governm ent is working toward closing off the Internet into tiered system s, then it understands the value of the data on the Internet.
As such, any use, by the governm ent or private corporation, to train AI should be easily understood as theft.
So either create your own dataset, pay the rightsholders a far sum  for use, or toss the project. 
If your argum ent is that you can’t use AI without that data, then you can’t survive without theft.
