General Comment
Note: This docum ent is approved for public dissem ination. The docum ent contains no business-proprietary or confidential inform ation. 
I am  writing as a concerned citizen requesting that our governm ent uphold our copyright laws. If AI com panies cannot train their m odels
without access to copyrighted works, then their product m odel was not and is not viable in the first place. 
It is essential to protecting the Am erican econom y and industries.
Entertainm ent: Movies, TV shows, m usic, artworks, books, m agazines, and any m edia IP that has a rightful copyright holder should have
protection, and be inform ed and duly com pensated if their work was used in a training m odel without their explicit written consent. If this
basic protection does not exist, the Am erican film m aking, anim ation, m usic, theater, and entertainm ent industries as a whole will suffer
financially. These sectors of the industry will m ove abroad, or to countries m ore viable and protective of their intellectual property.
Concerning videogam es, m any developers have already canceled their attendance to GDC, the Gam e Developers Conference, as it is
based in the United States. If the USA is not welcom ing to these industries, which are vital to global perception of the USA, they will
outpace and outclass us elsewhere, both financially and in technology.
Cost and Waste: I understand that this adm inistration does not care about dam age to the planet (here is som e data anyway about the
waste: https://news.m it.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environm ental-im pact-0117 ) so I will instead point to the m assive cost of
operating AI m odels, and how pushes for deregulation are a clear cry for a governm ent bailout. AI tools are expensive and wasteful:

https://finance.yahoo.com /news/report-reveals-openais-44-billion-145334935.htm l ) with little financial gain. They are failing in the
consum er sector, ( consum ers are not interested in AI tools: https://www.cnet.com /tech/m obile/73-of-iphone-owners-say-no-thanks-to-
apple-intelligence-new-data-echoes-cnets-findings/

)
so they are turning to the governm ent to bail them  out. Do not let them  Swindle you out of taxpayer m oney. Uphold copyright law. Protect
our econom y. 
Foreign powers: Our entertainm ent industry is one of the m ost powerful in the world, and our m edia com panies will lose ground to foreign
powers. If copyright is waived for "AI tools," what stops a foreign country from  doing the sam e with our m aterials? China already has
lim itations on AI tools: https://gdprlocal.com /chinas-evolving-ai-regulations-and-com pliance-for-com panies/ 
And Europe: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence


Once again, protect the Am erican Entertainm ent industry. Uphold copyright law. Don't contribute taxpayer m oney to wasteful AI tools
that are looking for an escape route from  their own poor business decisions.
