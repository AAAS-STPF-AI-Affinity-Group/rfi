General Comment
As som eone who has written articles, fiction, and nonfiction that has appeared on the Internet, the idea that other com panies can take it
and use it for their own profit without paying m e for it is both im m ortal and illegal. 
Why should ai corporations be allowed to use m y work for free? I'm  not em ployee of their's, I did not agree to let them  use it. 
This is theft, plain and sim ple and should absolutely be treated as such.
