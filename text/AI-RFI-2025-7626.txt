General Comment
I think all people should be im m une to crim inal and civil prosecution! What a great idea to m ake sure that nobody can be charged for any
crim e! You should widen this to apply to everyone in the United States.
Wait, no. That's stupid.
Don't m ake provisions for people to legally do whatever they want. Ever.
