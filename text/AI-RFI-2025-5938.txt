General Comment
I am  a librarian and inform ation technology specialist. I could list hundreds of articles discussing the dangers of so-called Artificial
Intelligence, the value of copyright and how m ost of these program s do not work as advertised. They serve no purpose beyond elim inating
Am erican jobs and create far m ore problem s than they solve. I have com piled a list of studies and sources which prove that AI is only of
value to hucksters seeking to m ake a fast-buck and a new generation of robber barons who seek to steal what they cannot buy.
I have attached a docum ent containing a sam pling of the best resources which show that what is called AI has no value and the copyright
laws of United States m ust rem ain intact and be enforced.
