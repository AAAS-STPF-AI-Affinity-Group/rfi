General Comment
Any AI action by the federal governm ent that neglects the real hum an and econom ic cost this has on Am erican workers (and norm al
people) is a com plete giveaway to the richest and m ost powerful people in the world. AI threatens the livelihoods of m illions of Am erican
workers at all skill levels, and there m ust be guardrails to protect these workers. AI im agery (and other Generative AI content) also
threatens Am erican social fabric with m isinform ation and DeepFake im agery that can be used to falsely incrim inate anyone or produce
nonconsensual sexual im agery. Worker protections m ust be put in place to protect the worker, not allow Big Tech to roam  free under the
guise of "innovation." If the US governm ent allows AI to run ram pant in our society and our econom y, devastation and chaos will ensue as
our country and econom y becom e less hum an.
