Subject:  Veriten Response to “Request for Information on the Development of an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan”  
Reference: 90 FR 9088, Document Number 2025- 02305  
Veriten appreciates the opportunity to submit feedback to the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy (OSTP) in response to its Request for Information on the 
Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan.  
AI has the potential to create the next industrial  revolution by unlocking existing natural 
resources deemed previously non- economic, enabling rapid prototyping of new 
industrial processes in virtual labs, strengthening domestic semiconductor manufacturing and supply chains, creating new carbon composite materials at scale to replace heavier metal and cement products, developing new compounds to nurture our crops, and by creating new AI models to enhance and analyze existing data sources. Our recommendations for the Action Plan are designed to be immediately actionable and enable the long- term development of impactful  AI applications. Energy is both a 
source to enable AI, and a key area of policy focus today as noted below, but government policy must also enable the use of AI in the e nergy sector to ensure U.S. 
global leadership in AI.

ENSURING  SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO POWER AI AND ACHIEVE U.S. AI & 
ENERGY DOMINANCE  
Energy dominance is a strategic priority of the Trump administration. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently emphasized that energy is fundamental to the economy and essential for sustaining U.S. manufacturing and AI innovation, explicitly linking energy and AI strategies. Each begets the other but  
together are of paramount importance to sovereignty and prolonged supremacy for the next century.  
The energy sector is keenly aware of its  complex supply chain with a unique 
perspective on local, federal and global pressures. Energy companies live in this physical reality and understand limiting factors of the infrastructure that enables social 
and economic prosperity . Virtual bits must flow over tangible cables and lines. Data and 
processing in the cloud resides in data centers that require power and steel in the 
ground. We believe policymakers shaping AI strategy can gain valuable insights from the energy and industrial sectors, especially amid evolving trade and technological competition with China. Veriten operates within this dynamic landscape, analyzing how shifting priorities could disrupt business models.  
To address the unprecedented surge in electricity demand driven by AI and data 
centers, we advocate for the following key policy actions that will strengthen the U.S. energy framework.  
•Reliable and Affordable Energy –  Uninterrupted, low -cost , baseload energy is
vital across the AI supply chain, from domestic chip manufacturing to powering AImodel training and inference. The private sector is swiftly mobilizing to expandenergy capacity for data centers, with Hyperscalers announcing annual


investments of $234B to $249B in 2025 and 20261—strong market signals for 
new generation and transmission infrastructure. However, Gartner predicts that 
40% of data centers will face operational constraints due to power shortages .2 
Some Hyperscalers are even revising their spending plans downward, not from lack of enthusiasm, but from lack of capacity to absorb their demand.
3 
Meanwhile, NERC and industry groups from both the technology and power sectors emphasize the urgent need for permitting reforms to accelerate new capacity development and meet surging demand.

•Technoeconomic Forecasting –  The federal government should conduct
comprehensive analyses to forecast the grid impacts of various approaches todata center and AI -driven demand growth. Factors such as grid resilience,
emissions, and additionality introduce complexity and uncertainty for developersand utilities. Balancing data center flexibility, increased generation capacity,clean energy mandates, and efficiency improvements presents overlappingchallenges. A strategic combination of these levers will likely offer the most cost -
effective and rapid path forward. Rigorous study of their interactions andlimitations can provide critical insights for setting informed national energytargets.
•Dispatchable Generation Build Out  – Hyperscalers are still defin ing their long-
term energy strategies  including the mix of nuclear , renewables, natural gas  with
carbon capture, geothermal and other power sources . In the near term,
leveraging natural gas -fired cogeneration in industrial hubs like Texas
5 and
Louisiana could accelerate capacity expansion while permitting reforms navigatefederal, state, and local regulatory hurdles. Since demand for grid- based power
exceeds historical buildout speeds by 5x in even the most conservativeprojections ,
6 utilities, data centers, and major energy companies must collaborate
to find or create substantially greater capacity than the grid can provide. Thismust be accomplished while avoiding at least three major constraints: (i) political
fallout from increased retail power costs (ii) reduced energy capacity for America-

commitments . 
•Prolonging Existing Incentives – Tax credits and loan programs have
significantly influenced developer strategies, particularly for nuclear energy
projects. Re- commissioning retired nuclear plants was once unthinkable, and
interest in expanding existing nuclear capacity was minimal before theseincentives and the rising AI -driven electricity demand picture. Maintaining these
policy signals is essential to sustaining investment in nuclear energy, ensuring astable, low -emission power supply for data center expansion.
•Incentivizing Grid Reliability – Grid-supporting assets, such as those enabling
load balancing and storm resilience, are often not incentivized appropriately incurrent structures. To ensure these critical capabilities are prioritized in futureenergy generation, targeted tax or cost incentives will be necessary. Encouragingdata center developers to integrate these considerations will be key to building amore resilient and reliable U.S. power grid.
•Incentivizing Grid Flexibility – Researchers suggest that increased flexibility in
data center operations could enable the existing grid to satisfy gigawatts ofincremental demand.
 7 However, a well -designed incentive structure is needed to
encourage developers to adopt flexible consumption models while consideringlocal consumer and industrial needs. Further, developers must consider whatkinds of compute workloads - AI training, inference, or hybrid cloud activities - will
comprise the bulk of their customer demand, as the diversity of said workloadsdirectly influences their hardware and energy needs. Absorbing grid margins mayprovide only a short - to medium -term solution, underscoring the necessity of new
power generation. Clearer guidance and targeted incentives will be essential toensuring sustainable and strategic energy expansion.
ENABLING  EFFECTIVE ADOPTION OF AI BY THE DOMESTIC ENERGY INDUSTRY  
The modern economy is built on four essential pillars —steel, cement, plastics, and 
fertilizer —all of which rely on abundant and affordable natural energy resources . This 
physical reality directly influences the cost of goods for both consumers and businesses. AI has the potential to improve economic efficiency, but its success depends on reducing costs across industries while enhancing—not replacing— human 
contributions.  
So far, much of the energy sector's AI focus has been on supply -side solutions. 
However, equal attention must be given to demand- side advancements, which fall into 
four key areas: (i) accelerating the development of AI -powered tools and data centers 
that w ill enhance our nation’s ability to identify and safely develop our domestic natural

resources (ii) leveraging AI to enhance productivity across the energy value chain, from 
extraction, refining and transportation to grid planning, permitting and management  (iii) 
utilizing AI -driven innovations to improve the safety and efficiency in extreme operating 
conditions and (iv) engaging in AI -powered R&D to drive innovation in new energy 
sources and materials, ultimately reducing reliance on finite natural resources . 
To unlock AI’s full potential in the energy industry and accelerate its adoption, we 
recommend the U.S. to implement the following key policy actions that support these advancements.   
•Infrastructure for Physical AI – Many of AI’s most transformative applications
in the energy industry exist in the physical world rather than the virtual one.Unlocking the full potential of Physical AI requires significant infrastructureinvestments across the data value chain. To accelerate adoption, thegovernment should prioritize R&D funding in key areas, including:
oIndustrial IoT (II oT) & Edge Computing –  Deploying ruggedized IIoT
sensors with edge computing capabilities to reduce data transmissionbottlenecks and enable AI -driven decision- making directly in the field.
oReliable Connectivity in Energy -Rich Regions –  Expanding wired and
wireless networks to support real -time data transmission between remote
sites and data centers.
oDigital Twin Development – Developing virtual models of physical assets
and systems to enhance operational efficiency, predictive maintenance,and risk assessment.
oAutomation & Robotics –  Advancing infrastructure for autonomous
systems to handle repetitive and hazardous tasks in the field such as
inspections, repairs, chemical replenishment, and product
loading/unloading, ultimately driving down operating expenses acrossindustrial sectors  including energy, mining and many others.
Strategic investments in these areas will remove barriers to AI adoption in industrial settings, improving efficiency, safety, and productivity across the energy sector.  
•Physical and Virtual Sandboxes to Accelerate Energy AI Applications –  To
drive innovation in AI -powered energy solutions, we propose the creation of
physical and virtual sandboxes on public “ lands ”—dedicated environments where
industry leaders, researchers, and AI developers can collaborate free fromantitrust concerns, proprietary data restrictions, and cybersecurity risks. Thesesandboxes would facilitate rapid experimentation and development in several keyareas:
oHigh -Performance Computing Access –  Leveraging D OE
supercomputers or other national infrastructure to support large- scale AI
model training and simulations.


oPhysical Testing Facilities –  Establishing pilot sites for oil & gas
production, renewable energy, and next -generation power systems to
validate AI applications in real -world conditions.
oDigital Twin & Virtual Prototyping – Creating controlled environments
for AI -driven modeling, testing, and scenario analysis.
oAI-Driven Material s Discovery – Using advanced simulations to
accelerate breakthroughs in energy storage, material synthesis, and
efficiency improvements.
These sandboxes could be housed within Department of Energy (DOE)  Labs, 
developed in partnership with leading AI firms such as Amazon, or modeled after specialized test facilities funded by the DOE like Colorado State’s METEC for methane monitoring. By providing a secure and collaborative ecosystem for experimentation, these centers would serve as proving grounds for breakthrough 
energy innovations. Establishing these sandboxes on federal lands would also support Secretary Doug Burgum’s efforts to unlock our nation’s natural resources that are worth trillions.

•Prizes for AI & Energy – To drive breakthrough innovation at the intersection of
AI and energy, we propose a series of c ompetitions  that challenge industry
leaders, startups, and researchers to develop cutting- edge solutions. While
competitions must be designed carefully, potential competition themes include:
oEnhancing Renewable Energy Affordability, Reliability (24/7) and
Resiliency – AI-driven solutions to optimize energy generation, storage,
grid stability, and renewable integration.
oAI-Designed E&P or Mining Operations – Building a fully autonomous
exploration and production (E&P) or mining capability  from the ground up
using AI.
oAI-Driven Industrial Wastewater Treatment – Developing intelligent
systems for cost -effective and sustainable O&G wastewater management.
oNext -Generation Materials Innovation –  Leveraging AI for combinatorial
synthesis and modeling to discover new materials with superiorperformance.
By incentivizing AI -driven breakthroughs in these areas, the U.S. can accelerate 
advancements in energy, sustainability, and industrial efficiency.  
•Protecting Proprietary Data in AI Applications – AI’s ability to analyze vast
multimodal datasets is transformative, but concerns over proprietary andsensitive data often limit access. To encourage broader data sharing whilesafeguarding privacy and intellectual property, the government should promote:
oAdvanced Encryption Methods  – Implementing secure encryption
techniques to allow AI models to process data without exposing underlyingproprietary information.
8 U.S. Secretary Doug Burgum Pitches Resources on Federal Lands as Assets Worth Trillions  


oAnony mization & Differential Privacy  – Developing frameworks that
remove or mask sensitive identifiers while preserving data utility for AI -
driven insights.
oFederated Learning & Secure Data Collaboration  – Encouraging AI
training methods that enable data analysis without direct access to raw
datasets, reducing risks of exposure.
These measures would help mitigate privacy concerns, fostering AI innovation while ensuring that proprietary data remains protected.  
•Ensuring AI Accuracy in the Physical World – AI accuracy is critical when
applied to the physical world, where errors in autonomous navigation, industrialprocess control, or infrastructure management can have severe consequences.To enhance reliability, the government should promote:
oDeveloping Energy -Specific Compound AI Systems – Most AI
applications in scientifically rigorous fields require deterministic, "classicmachine learning (ML)" models to make auditable predictions (e.g.random forest classifiers, multivariate regression, and XGBoost).However, generative AI models' (e.g. transformer models) accessibilityenables workers and scientists alike to naturally interface with intelligentsystems via simple language. Hybrid, or "compound" AI systems, combinethe best of both worlds - an LLM can interpret, challenge, and refine user
instructions before executing a classic ML model via function calling orAPI call, saving users a tremendous amount of time tuning and refiningmodels between runs. This would be a substantial productivity boost
across the entire labor class of energy R&D.
oExplainability & Auditing – Requiring transparency in AI decision-
making through interpretable models and audit trails to diagnose errors.
oRedundant Safety Mechanisms – Implementing fail -safes and human- in-
the-loop oversight in critical applications to mitigate AI failures.
oContinuous Learning & Monitoring – Developing frameworks for
ongoing model updates, real -time performance monitoring, and error
correction.
By integrating these safeguards, AI systems can achieve the high levels of accuracy and reliability necessary for effective deployment in the physical world.  
•Securing Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Microgrids with AI – As
concerns over grid reliability grow, investments in microgrid applications anddistributed energy resources (DERs) are expanding. However, with this growthcomes heightened cybersecurity risks, as each connected DER asset introducespotential attack vectors, increasing the threat of cyber intrusions, gridmanipulation, and cascading failures. To ensure grid security and resilience, thefollowing measures are critical:


oAI-Driven Threat Detection – Implementing real -time anomaly detection
and predictive analytics to identify and respond to cyber threats before
they escalate.
oSecure Communication Protocols – Establishing encrypted,
standardized frameworks to protect data transmission between DERs,microgrids, and the central grid.
oCoordinated Incident Response Mechanisms – Developing AI -assisted
security operations centers (SOCs) for rapid response to cyber threats.
oRegulatory & Compliance Frameworks – Defining clear standards for
data governance, AI transparency, and cybersecurity compliance toprevent vulnerabilities.
oAI Certification & Testing Standards – Establishing rigorous AI model
testing for critical energy infrastructure, similar to IEC and IEEEcertification processes for electrical components.
Standardizing AI applications in the energy sector will be crucial to ensuring safety, reliability, interoperability, and ethical deployment. Developing AI -specific 
compliance frameworks and risk mitigation strategies will prevent DERs from becoming liabilities while strengthening overall grid security.  
•AI & Workforce Transformation – AI is set to disrupt nearly 40% of jobs
worldwide, transforming industries by both replacing and complementing humanroles. In advanced economies, up to 60% of jobs will be impacted, with AIintegration enhancing productivity in some cases while reducing labor demand inothers
9. If managed thoughtfully, AI can serve as a force for good, augmenting
human capabilities and enabling the workforce to focus on higher -order critical
thinking. However, without strategic policies, AI adoption could deepen economicinequality, displace workers, and weaken workforce confidence. To ensure abalanced approach, policymakers must:
oStrengthen Workforce Upskilling & Adaptation – Investing in AI
literacy, retraining programs, and education initiatives to help workerstransition into AI -enhanced roles.
oPreserve Economic Stability & Job Security – Implementing policies
that mitigate job displacement while allowing businesses to leverage AI’sefficiencies.
oExpand the Skilled Trade Workforce – The rising power demand for AI
will require a surge in electricians, grid technicians, and infrastructurespecialists to support data center expansion and grid modernization.
AI should complement, not replace, human labor —driving higher productivity, 
better wages, and enhanced innovation. A structured human resource infrastructure must be established now to ensure AI adoption strengthens the economy rather than exacerbating job losses.

DEM OCRATIZING DATA: THE KEY TO AI ADVANCEMENT IN THE ENERGY 
SECTOR  
One of the most impactful government policies to accelerate AI adoption in energy could 
be democratizing access to existing physical data. In fact, this single action may be the 
key to unlocking the innovation potential of current AI -enhanced digital assets. In 
countries like China, the government owns and openly shares10 vast datasets with the 
tech industry, driving rapid AI advancements such as DeepSeek and Manus.  
In contrast, the U.S. operates under a fragmented data system, where proprietary datasets —especially in the energy sector —are often treated as a competitive “moat”, 
creating barriers that hinder innovation. Limited access to high- quality physical data 
slows AI model training, reduces efficiency gains, and restricts technological breakthroughs. Meanwhile, multiple well -funded competitors will double, triple, or 
quadruple capital spending  to get comparable data and resources, making for a much 
more inefficient use of capital in the aggregate compared to a coordinated approach.  
For example, in traditional energy sectors like oil and gas, subsurface geological data provides a major competitive advantage. Companies with access to high- quality 
geological datasets can significantly reduce exploration risks, optimize drilling strategi es, and improve financial performance. However, acquiring this data is often 
expensive and difficult, especially for smaller companies that lack the resources to purchase proprietary datasets.  
The good news is that much of this data exists, but in fragmented, incomplete, or difficult -to-use formats. Consider the following examples:  
•Geophysical logs, which measure rock properties such as porosity and resistivity,are legally required to be submitted to state agencies. However, these logs are
often incomplete or available only as raster images, making them hard to
analyze. A small operator assessing a potential drilling site may have to manuallydigitize the data— an expensive and time- consuming process. While vendors
provide high- quality digitized logs, they come at a high cost, limiting access for
smaller players.
•Rock properties and geochemistry data, including porosity, permeability, andhydrocarbon content, are critical for evaluating reservoirs. However, thesedatasets are often stored in hard- to-use formats like PDFs or paper archives. A
geologist studying source rock potential, for instance, may need to manually siftthrough physical core samples at a state survey office or rely on scatteredspreadsheet datasets. While some basic regulatory data (such as oil gravity or

water chemistry) is available, deeper analyses (e.g., SARA fractions) remain 
proprietary and inaccessible.  
•Geophysical data, such as seismic, gravity, and magnetic surveys, is essential
for subsurface imaging. While offshore seismic data from USGS is freelyavailable and highly valuable for AI/ML applications in oil, gas, and mineralexploration, onshore seismi c data is often prohibitively expensive— costing tens
of thousands of dollars or more per square mile. This limits access for smallercompanies that could otherwise leverage AI to uncover new energy resources.
•Historical physical records, including maps, books, and field notes housed ingeological survey archives and university libraries, contain invaluableobservational data. A mining company, for example, might discover century -old
field notes detailing ore- bearing formations, but these records are typically
available only in physical form, requiring extensive effort to digitize.
These barriers to data accessibility and integration create inefficiencies in exploration, modeling, and decision -making, particularly for smaller operators. Ironically, these 
smaller firms are often more innovative and agile than their larger counterparts, yet they face the greatest challenges in obtaining the data necessary to compete, coagulating our innovation cycle and national competitiveness. The Shale revolution was started by these scrappy smaller firms which set the stage for the U.S. current dominant position in oil and gas production . These resources were known for decades  but only became 
commercially viable through technological breakthroughs in the last two decades.  Providing this data to a broad set of companies, combined with the proposed creation of a physical and virtual sandbox discussed in the prior section , has the potential to extend 
the U.S. resource production in both oil and gas and mining.  
To maintain America’s competitive edge in energy and AI  and to support Secretary 
Doug Burgum’s vision to map deposits of oil, gas and critical minerals on US federal lands
11, we propose the following AI policy actions:  
•Create an Open -Source Subsurface Geological Database Using Publicly
Available Data –  Create a standardized digital repository for subsurface
geological data across energy -rich basins in the U.S., including both onshore and
offshore resources. Ensure data is stored in a machine- readable format with
APIs for seamless integration by AI developers and energy companies, enablingreal-time analysis and model improvement. The government can build upon the
existing publicly available data and enhance the open- sourc e database by
offering tax credits or reduced royalty rates from production on public lands.
•Develop Open -Source  Subsurface Models  – Leverage national labs to process
the open- source datasets to create AI -driven models with unprecedented
insights. Just as  META created its  open -source Llama  model for the tech industry
to leverage, the energy industry would similarly benefit from a centrally built

US federal lands  


model. These models would be made available to startups and companies, 
allowing them to refine their own AI -driven models and tools by training on their 
own proprietary data . This would promote competition and innovation in AI 
applications and operational execution while preserving proprietary information. 
•Expand Open- Source Databases & Models for AI Development Across the
Energy Value Chain – Establish publicly accessible databases for production,
emissions, electricity grid performance, energy consumption, and other energy -
related aspects. Enable AI -driven insights into energy optimization,
decarbonization, and grid efficiency through structured, well -curated datasets.
By removing barriers to data access, the U.S. can foster AI innovation, empower 
smaller AI and energy players, and create a lasting competitive advantage in the global 
energy sector. An open data strategy will not only boost domestic energy efficiency and security but also position the U.S. as a leader in AI -driven energy solutions for the 
future.  
Summary  
This AI Action Plan outlines critical policy recommendations to ensure the U.S. has the 
energy capacity to power AI -driven growth while accelerating AI adoption across the 
energy sector. We have focused our recommendations on near -term, actionable items 
that can have an outsized impact on AI  and energy  strategies which are now 
inseparably linked—without a resilient, scalable, and affordable energy infrastructure, AI’s transformative potential cannot be fully realized.  
To maintain global leadership, the U.S. must take decisive action: removing barriers to energy data access, modernizing AI infrastructure, and streamlining permitting to fast -
track energy expansion. As China aggressively aligns its AI and energy policies, the U.S. cannot afford a fragmented approach. A coordinated national strategy is essential to avoid a chaotic free- for-all in AI resource deployment —one that could overwhelm an 
already strained domestic energy grid.  
Success will require intra -industry collaboration, bringing together energy producers, AI 
developers, and policymakers to create an efficient, innovation- driven ecosystem. By 
aligning AI and energy priorities, fostering cross -sector partnerships, and inves ting in 
next-generation infrastructure, the U.S. can turn AI into an engine of industrial 
renewal —securing both technological and economic dominance in the decades ahead.  
Veriten appreciates the Administration’s consideration of the above views. We encourage  OSTP to contact Robert Kester (  with any questions or 
ways that we can assist moving forward.
