General Comment
Artificial Intelligence com panies of any sort do not deserve the ability to infringe on any copyrighted m aterial they see fit. AI is of little to
no value to the United States and should not get such flagrant favoritism  from  the federal governm ent, especially as it exploits actual artists,
writers and m usicians.
