To ensure the  United S tates ma intains  its le adership in a rtificial intelligence, the  AI Ac tion  Plan 
must go beyond accelerating adoption and address foundational gaps in digital and data literacy, 
governance, and strategic implementation. First, federal agencies n eed dom ain-specifi c AI and

AI Action Plan Comments by D. Finkenstadt, PhD. 2/25/2025  Comments on RFI for Development of an AI Action Plan 
By. D. Finkenstadt, LtCol, USAF, PhD.  
To ensure the United States maintains its leadership in artificial intelligence, the AI Action Plan 
must go beyond accelerating adoption and address foundational gaps in digital and data 
literacy, governance, and strategic implementation. First, federal agencies need domain-
specific AI and data literacy programs—embedding technical acumen within specialized fields 
like acquisitions, intelligence, and healthcare, rather than relying on external data scientists. 
Second, AI governance must prevent investment traps and hype-driven adoption, ensuring 
leaders have the technical literacy to evaluate AI claims, avoid short-termism, and implement 
mission-aligned solutions. Finally, AI adoption must be guided by a structured digital 
transformation roadmap, prioritizing process mapping, evolutionary AI integration, and agile 
cybersecurity policies that remove barriers to rapid, secure deployment. Without these 
foundational elements, AI implementation risks inefficiency, redundancy, and compromised 
security.
1. Digital & Data Literacy in Functional Government Areas
Why it Matters:
Current AI strategies often assume that simply embedding data scientists into government 
functions will yield transformative results. However, true impact requires upskilling 
personnel in specialized functional areas like acquisitions, intelligence, education, and 
health.
Key Policy Recommendations: 
•Develop AI & Data Literacy Training  tailored to specialized roles rather than generic
government -wide courses.
•Embed Digital Acumen into Workforce Development Plans  to ensure specialists in
government functions understand how AI and data apply to their domain  (e.g.,
contracting officers understanding AI -assisted procurement rather than relying on
external data teams).
•Establish Cross -Disciplinary AI Cohorts  where domain experts and AI practitioners
co-design solutions together , ensuring contextually relevant AI applications .
Clarification of Literacy Terms:  
•Digital Literacy  = The ability to engage with, evaluate, and apply digital
technologies effectively  (e.g., "I can use ChatGPT for research").
•Data Literacy  = The ability to interpret, analyze, and make decisions based on data
(e.g., "I can assess price distributions in contract analysis").
AI Policy Action Needed:  A national AI workforce development framework that integrates 
domain -specific  digital and data literacy within federal agencies.


AI Action Plan Comments by D. Finkenstadt, PhD. 2/25/2025  2. Preventing "AI Washing" in Leadership & Investment  (see this arti cle:
https://cmr.berkeley.edu/2024/12/ai -washing -the-cultural -traps -that-lead-to-exaggeration -
and-how-ceos -can-stop -them/ )
Why it Matters:
Without technical literacy at the leadership level, poor AI investments, overreliance on 
vendor hype, and rushed implementations  will undermine U.S. AI leadership.
Common AI Washing Traps & Their Risks:  
1.Lack of Technical Literacy at the Top:
oLeaders without AI fluency overhype  capabilities and fund inefficient or
unnecessary solutions .
oExample: AI claims in contracting tools without valid data pipelines or
explainability mechanisms .
2.Pressure for Perpetual Innovation:
oOrganizations prioritize "looking innovative"  over actual mission -aligned AI
solutions .
oExample: Rushing AI-based fraud detection  into procurement without testing
data integrity and bias risks .
3.Short -Termism in AI Investments:
oAI projects are measured only by immediate wins , neglecting long -term
sustainability .
oExample: Adopting proprietary AI tools  without a roadmap for open -source
alternatives .
4.FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):
oAgencies adopt AI solutions just because others are doing it .
oExample: Rushed generative AI deployments  in document automation
without governance models .
Policy Recommendation:  
•Mandate AI Literacy for Government Leadership
oAI investment decisions should be evaluated by leaders with structured AI
literacy training .
•Require Explainability & Transparency in AI Procurement
oAny AI procurement must meet defined technical review standards  that
prevent overpromised solutions.
•Establish AI Ethics & Oversight Councils


AI Action Plan Comments by D. Finkenstadt, PhD. 2/25/2025  oSimilar to cybersecurity compliance , AI use should be monitored for bias,
security risks, and unintended policy implications .
AI Policy Action Needed:  AI governance frameworks that prevent investment hype  and align 
AI tools with mission -critical needs .
3. Structured & Evolutionary Digital Transformation  to Reduce AI Washing Risk  (See
Addendum 1: Digital Roadmap Speci fication Draft )
Why it Matters:
AI adoption without a strategic roadmap  leads to piecemeal, uncoordinated 
implementations  that waste resources and create redundant systems.
Key AI Process Mapping & Transformation Recommendations:  
•Invest in Process Mapping at Every Level
oAI adoption should align with a digital transformation roadmap , not just
individual AI deployments.
oExample: The Digital Roadmap Requirements Document  outlines a process -
based AI adoption model  ensuring that each AI solution supports mission
efficiency .
•Implement a Dynamic & Evolutionary AI Integration Model
oAI policy should encourage iterative AI adoption —allowing flexibility for
emerging technologies  rather than rigid one -time procurements .
•Cybersecurity & AI Risk Alignment
oCurrent cybersecurity compliance frameworks ( e.g., CMMC, Authority to
Operate (ATO) ) slow AI deployments  due to fragmented security policies .
oAI security needs agile, mission -integrated cybersecurity  rather than
compliance -heavy bottlenecks.
Policy Recommendation:  
•Establish a Government AI Digital Roadmap Framework
oEnsure AI investments map directly to operational needs  rather than ad -hoc
implementations.
•Reform AI Security & Compliance Standards
oStreamline CMMC and ATO  processes to allow faster AI deployments without
compromising security .
•Embed Cybersecurity into AI Literacy Programs
oAI literacy must include cybersecurity awareness —ensuring leaders don’t
deploy AI without understanding security risks .


AI Action Plan Comments by D. Finkenstadt, PhD. 2/25/2025  AI Policy Action Needed:  A government -wide AI Digital Transformation Strategy  that 
prioritizes structured, security -conscious, and mission -aligned AI deployments .
Conclusion:  
The AI Action Plan must integrate AI with functional workforce development, leadership 
accountability, and structured transformation strategies  rather than simply accelerating AI 
adoption for innovation’s sake . By addressing:
1.AI & Data Literacy for Government Specialties
2.AI Governance Against Hype & Investment Traps
3.A Process -Based AI Digital Roadmap with Agile Cybersecurity
We can ensure that AI enhances U.S. global leadership in a sustainable and mission -
driven way.


AI Action Plan Comments by D. Finkenstadt, PhD. 2/25/2025  Addendum 1: Digital Transformation Roadmap Platform Requirements Specification  
Purpose Statement  
The Department of the Air Force (DAF)1 faces an unprecedented opportunity to leverage
artificial intelligence, automation, and emerging technologies to transform its business systems 
and processes. With the rapid advancement of commercial technology solutions and the 
increasing availability of AI -enabled tools, the DAF must establish a systematic approach to 
evaluate, select, and implement digital solutions across the enterprise.
Currently, the DAF lacks a standardized method to:
•Map existing business processes and identify opportunities for digital enhancement
•Track and evaluate the numerous emerging technology solutions and vendors
•Make data -driven, resource -based decisions about technology investments
•Prevent duplicate investments across different organizations
•Monitor the implementation status and maturity of digital solutions
•Ensure strategic alignment of digital investments with mission objectives
This platform addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive framework for 
managing the DAF's digital transformation journey, enabling informed decision -making about 
technology investments, and ensuring efficient resource allocation across the ent erprise. By 
implementing this solution, the DAF can better navigate the complex landscape of emerging 
technologies, avoid redundant investments, and accelerate the adoption of mission -enhancing 
digital capabilities.
