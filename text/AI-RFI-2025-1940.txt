General Comment
DO NOT LET THIS PASS. As a writer I do not give perm ission for big tech com panies to steal m y work and m y data so an AI can
regurgitate it. Stealing creative work from  hum ans, then using AI to replace the very creatives they stole from , is reprehensible. If AI is
trained on copyrighted m aterial, then due com pensarion should be given to those who hold the copyright. Anything else is theft of
intellectual property.
