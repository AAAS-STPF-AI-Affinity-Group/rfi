To whom it may concern:
I specifically do not support the contents of the Development of AI Action Plan. If allowed,
this would AI developers the means to bypass pre-existing copyright laws and render fair uselaw close to meaningless.
 
While I do think AI has its place in our society, these developers risk harming the lives andlivelihoods of American laborers in all trades if left without some sort of regulatory oversight.If the contents of this action plan and the actions of this administration are anything to go by,there would be little to no oversight. That is not something we should want to do with new anddeveloping technology.
Good day.
Thomas Daley
