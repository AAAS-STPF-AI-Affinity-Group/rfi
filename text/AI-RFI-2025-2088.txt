General Comment
This issue m arks a critical turning point for the future of Am erican industry. For decades the US has been a vanguard of the creative space
- leveraging free speech, capitalistic principles and a m eritocratic system  to birth som e of the m ost canonic art in hum an history.
That legacy and store of value is under attack. The precedent the US sets in regards to the value of training data is not an attack on its
m ulti-trillion dollar tech oligopolies, but a safeguard in ensuring the rich Am erican art and cultural heritage retains its value in a new
technological age. The prom ise of generative AI as an aid and tool in hum an tasks cannot be understated, and a reasonable resolution
regarding its developm ent is necessary - but not at the expense of the livelihoods of the m illions of creative workers and sm all businesses
that grease the gears of Am erican cultural export.
Our future as a country can only hope to be exponential, not m erely iterative. Generative AI, as an unchecked, sole driving engine is
predictively Bayesian in output. Over tim e, left unregulated, it will consum e the sm all lower-tier of creative industries that create hum an
m astery in the fields we prize m ost, and in doing so neuter the next class of artists, writers, m usicians and film m akers. We m ust not allow
generative AI to freely train on our national canon of copyright - we m ust set a precedent of com pensation and ensure the future of
Am erican creativity does not die in a tsunam i of AI-generated m ediocre slop.
