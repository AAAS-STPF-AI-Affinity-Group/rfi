General Comment
Artificial intelligence should be used for processing things that will benefit hum anity, not m axim ize corporate profit. Theft of all kinds is out
of control in this sector, in attem pts to "train" m odels that otherwise wouldn't be able to function without HUMAN work. These should
never have been trained without the perm ission of the creators. This goes for painting, m usic, writing, anim ation, voice acting, etc. 
A disgusting am algam ation of data being regurgitated from  bits and pieces of hum an work is not valuable or ethical. You will harm
countess professions by rem oving barriers. These com panies need to be held ethically and m orally accountable with increased barriers. 
We have the m eans to do so m uch good. Use AI to try to find m edical cures or solutions to com plex problem s, not steal the livelihood of
hundreds of thousands of people. Please.
