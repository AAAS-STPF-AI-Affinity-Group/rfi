General Comment
OpenAI is not AI, itâ€™s a categorically different technology. It is pure and sim ple legalized(?) theft of intellectual property that offers the
public nothing but worse, m ore expensive, goods services and healthcare, and an excuse for vulture capitalists to strip m ine our econom y
and throw working Am ericans on the slag heap. A fig leaf for all m anner of wanton m alfeasance from  UHC illegally denying healthcare to
their captive custom ers, negligent corporate behavior that perm anently destroys industry for short term  profit, and war crim es targeting
civilians in Palestine. Kill it all with fire.
