General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a p lace in the future of t he US. AI stea ls from my livelihood as an American a nd pro fits off of theft. AI is 
overh yped and is fleecing the eyes of the American publ ic.
Seriousl y, do the ri ght thing for once in your &^% life. You've already &^% us on every other front.
