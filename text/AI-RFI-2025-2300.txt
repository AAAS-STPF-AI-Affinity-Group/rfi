General Comment
Please do not allow copy written m aterial to be used within training data. These com panies are extracting huge am ounts of value from
assets and intellectual property that they did not create or ask perm ission to use. The copy written work of tens of thousands of artists,
authors, m usicians and actors are being used by m ajor corporations like Microsoft and Meta to directly com pete with those creators in
the sam e m arket place. Giving the option to "Opt Out" is not a viable solution. Much of this copy written work is taken from  social m edia
sites where users are frequently posting the creations of others. The actual creators have no control of other users and what they post. The
laws of copy write need to be upheld. This is not fair use. If a com pany would like to use the assets of another com pany or creator as part
of their com m ercial product, they need to seek perm ission directly from  the rights holder and provide com pensation, as the law requires.
