Hello, 
I am writing to provide feedback on the AI action plan.
As a published author and professional writer who creates original work from my own  
experience and imagination, I am strongly opposed to my work being used to train and feed AI  
models. I did not consent to my work being used in this way. I feel appalled that my writing  
could be used to create a tool aimed at replacing me. These models and their makers steal from  
American workers, all so that people who are already ultra-rich can profit even more. 
Please protect American creatives and all workers from unchecked AI. Use your power to  
control this tool and prevent it from stealing the creative work of people like me. Do not give  
this industry immunity from copyright infringement lawsuits or other challenges to their theft  
of intellectual property. 
Thank you and I ask that you do the right thing with the AI action plan.
Anna Loomis
