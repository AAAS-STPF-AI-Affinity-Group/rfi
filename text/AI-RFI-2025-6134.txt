General Comment
Generative tech, m isnam ed as “artificial intelligence” relies on content developed by hum an creators and thinkers. AI cannot exist without
pillaging the work of m any as it cannot “create” out of thin air.
Besides being terrible for the environm ent, the large language m odels used to train AI clients violate copyright law and its use am ounts to
theft.
Tech com panies m ust not be allowed to profit off of the theft of intellectual property.
