General Comment
The m ain thing I would like to get across is that the United States should NOT be m aking any special considerations or exceptions to laws
or rules for AI. AI com panies have consistently oversold and overblown the capabilities of their system s, all in service of getting
investm ent to m ake m assive am ounts of m oney for products which have never delivered on its prom ises. It would be a great sham e if they
m anaged to sell a bridge to the Am erican governm ent as well. AI has not shown anything to convince a reasonable person that it's "the
future" and it has not done anything to earn our investm ent.
What AI has m anaged to do, however, is com m it m assive am ounts of intellectual property theft. AI com panies have continually trained
their products on copyrighted writing, copyrighted art, a variety of other copyrighted works, and User data and com m ents on various
social m edia. It is all theft. It's ridiculous that AI com panies have been allowed to get away with it up to this point. It would be, beyond
ridiculous, an insult to EVERY Am erican who has created, with their own m ind and body, art or writing or anything else if AI com panies
are given special privileges to train on copyrighted works.
AI is not the future of Am erica. Don't let AI com panies run ram pant over our laws.
