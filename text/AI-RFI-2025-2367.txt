General Comment
I believe som e form  of regulations should rem ain on "AI"/LLMs scraping of inform ation upon content. I'm  a writer, and while I believe
copyright protections should rem ain in place for m y work and extend to AI/LLMs training on m y work, and that they should not be
perm itted to do so without due com pensation to m yself, the creator, I also am  very skeptical of OpenAI's claim  that widespread use of AI
will lead to better national security. Copyright protections then would not extend to the AI-produced content of such com panies, either,
m eaning anyone could take and m anipulate that content as well without repercussions. Proliferation of video such as deepfakes will
continue to spread fake news. I wonder also about cinem a, for instance, and the m ovies produced in this country. Without any protections
in place, then anyone in any country, on any continent, would have even easier access to United States-produced work--including
anything involved in our national security. Again, I do not see how such will ultim ately benefit Am erica.
