General Comment
While I am  ideologically opposed to copyright, I m ust adm it that a com prom ise m ust be m ade such that people can be paid a living wage
for their labor. Until such tim e as we have a universal incom e, I think corporations should have to respect copyright of sm all creators
rather than have unfettered accesss.
