General Comment
For the sake of intellectual property laws and the dignity of all artists everywhere, it is a disgrace to the Am erican people to pass any sort
of laws or potential precedent that would allow anyone to illegally steal whatever they want for AI. It's entirely against what m akes
Am erica great. You're spitting in the face of m illions of Am ericans who m ake a living producing art, whether that be drawings, writings, or
anything else that these billion dollar com panies will steal to enhance their products. You should all be asham ed to give these vial
organizations the ability to freely steal whatever they want. We cannot and should not let these organizations get away with whatever they
want. We have laws for a reason. People are supposed to be able to m ake a living off of whatever they m ake. This is theft. AI is theft. If
these com panies can't survive without stealing from  others, then these organizations should not exist. Period.
