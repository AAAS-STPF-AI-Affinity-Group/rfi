Hey there, I’m sending this message to kindly ask the government to deny OpenAI or any
other generative AI companies' plea to achieve further development and immunity to alllawsuits regarding copyright infringement. The reason why I’m saying this is because thosegenerative AI companies will steal any creative thing that is or isn’t copyrighted and makelazy, soulless versions of whatever they want and get away with it due to you (thegovernment) allowing these companies to run rampant because some people think it the futureof technology, but it’s actually stealing other people’s creativity and claiming it as your own.To reiterate, I kindly ask the government to not allow OpenAI to be immune to all lawsuitsregarding copyright infringement because it will allow them and any other generative AIcompany to steal any art, writing, and voice that belong to different people and makecopyright infringing stuff out of it.So would you kindly do that for the greater good of society please.
