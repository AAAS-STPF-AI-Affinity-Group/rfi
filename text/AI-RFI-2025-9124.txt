General Comment
Do not let a greed driven, lie and nonsense spitting, half baked auto correct run this country. 
Allowing AI to steal will not only crush the lives of honest hardworking Am erican people but further drive the country into a pit of illiterate,
m achine dependent shells of hum an beings. Do not let AI sap the resources and health of the planet just so it can lie to us, steal from  us. 
Do not spit on the hard work of the past, respect the Copyright Laws in place and refuse the greed and lies trying to poison and steal the
soul of the Am erican people.
