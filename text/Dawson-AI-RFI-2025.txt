Mackenzie Dawson,  
My name is Mackenzie Dawson and I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at 
Avonwor th High School. I completed a semester course on AI and Ethics and studied the 
impacts of Generative AI on the sports communities, particularly volleyball. EO 14179 will improve and policy about innovation and competition should be based on the effects that AI can have on a wide variety of sports that are played globally. However, with advancements in American AI technology, we can establish an advantage over other count ries in implementing AI 
in the sports world. My research on that specific topic has provided me with the knowledge that AI is beginning to establish its connections to sports through video analysis technology to provide insight into film analysis that we have not had prior. Being able to identify things that are impossible to recognize with just the human eye when it comes to strategy and placement based on the identified positioning of players and the game itself, is a new idea in itself, and with this executive order backing its ideals, the possibilities of AI in the future of sports in America are endless.
