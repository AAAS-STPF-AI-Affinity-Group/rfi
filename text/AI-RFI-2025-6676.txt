I do not support loosened restrictions or regulations for artificial intelligence. Carving out a copyright exception for AI harms businesses,  
artists, consumers, and the planet. Keep AI regulated.
AI steals copyrighted works. 
For businesses this means loss of profits on copyrighted works and increase d legal fees incurred when protect ing their works.
For artists, this means loss of work and profits, as well as undercutting when an AI replicates their individual style of work.
If AI is unregulated, it will eat itself and drown markets with s&^%. As it stands, AI hallucinates incorrect informati on and 
creates &^% knockof fs. As AI incorporates other AI generated material s into it's models, it will exacerbate these problem s and 
flood m arkets will worse and worse garbag e. Consu mers will becom e inundated with untrustworth y and &^% produ cts. They 
will stop spendi ng money,v isiting websites, and engaging as it gets worse.
The amount of resources AI requires also hurts everyone. It vastly increase s demand and cost of energy - espec ially now as tariffs 
increas e energy costs importe d from other countries. And it also contributes to our worsening climate crisis through its energy use 
footpr int.
