So called AI, which is a term that colloquially refers to a large group of semi related technologies 
but most often is used today to describe LLMs(Large Language Models), is a tower of cards. The gamblers in Silicon Valley want to dupe the American public into hitching every single wagon in 
the country to this feeble horse for their sole benefit of these monied elites. These are not public companies, they are beholden to no-one, they obfuscate and lie about the power of their output. When the smoke clears and the mirrors crack, the average american will be left holding the bill. DO NOT LET THIS CONTINUE. Don’t feed into the delusion of tech imagineers while compromising the security of the state with untested and vulnerable new technologies. The government has always relied on well tested and hardened systems. The temptation to get “an edge” over our adversaries will lead us to make a deal with the devil. Please reconsider any plan that further entrenches this unstable new technology in our nations sensitive system or funnels more of the taxpayers hard earned dollars into this imminently collapsing scheme. Thank you for taking the time to consider the voices of the people.
