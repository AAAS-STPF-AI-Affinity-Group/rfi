General Comment
Greetings,
I am  an illustrator by trade. Rem oving copyright restrictions in order to steal m y work and train "m achine learning" m odels directly im pacts
m y livelihood negatively. Generative m achine learning tools flood m arkets with low-quality products. They waste precious energy, water,
com putational power, m oney, and tim e, in an age where all of those things are becom ing m ore scarce, all while providing no actual benefit
to hum anity as a whole. 
Even if actual artificial sentience would be a benefit to hum anity, it is not achievable through m achine learning technology. Here is an
interesting, well-researched article for further reading:

Do not allow tech industry charlatans to trick you into allowing them  to steal and profit personally off of the entirety of our collective
culture.
