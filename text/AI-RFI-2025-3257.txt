General Comment
AI has been proven tim e and tim e again to be pure theft from  those who create any kind of art, such as writing and painting. Additionally,
AI that has been im plem ented by businesses, such as airlines and telecom m unications com panies, is not helpful to those who require
assistance and actively works against the businesses interests at tim es. AI is a genuine safety concern and should not be so hastily pushed
upon the Am erican people or those of other countries as it could lead to serious consequences towards the well-being of the public.
