General Comment
AI has no place in our arts. Copyright exists to keep ghouls away from  stealing ideas, creations and im agination and these soulless
garbage m ongerers hawking AI at the expense of all beauty in the world deserve to be in the depths of of ugliest pit on earth, not near
beauty, language, and prose.
