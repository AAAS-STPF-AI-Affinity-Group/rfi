General Comment
Generative AI provides no use whatsoever to the future of the US. It is an overhyped technology that is prom oted to solve problem s that
are m ore efficiently solved by other m eans. In m ost use cases, it fails to do the things that it claim s to be capable of, wasting the tim e and
m oney of every person who has to deal with it. The use of copyrighted m aterial to train AI is theft of intellectual property and steals the
financial incentive for creating new writing and art. The insertion of generative AI into products m akes them  useless and annoying.
There is no value in encouraging the developm ent of AI. Do not reduce the fee regulations that exist.
