General Comment
I absolutely refuse to allow self-serving technology com panies to copy and m ass reproduce m y artwork, even if they try and justify it by
running it through an AI "filter" first. I have already seen m any popular artists have their works stolen and recreated and nauseum  via AI
tools, and this causes both financial harm  and stress to the original creators. We'll be selling out brilliant m inds and undercutting the drive of
writers, artists, engineers, scientists, creators of all kinds - who wants to create new things when it'll just get stolen by the rich CEO of
som e tech com pany?
