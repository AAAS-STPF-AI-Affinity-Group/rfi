General Comment
I deeply oppose any loosening of copyright just for the sake of letting com panies train m odels m ore easily. Large language m odels are
fundam entally, m athem atically unsound, and weakening our copyright laws to appease a sm all group of com panies backed by venture
capital is foolish at best and actively detrim ental to the arts in this country at worst.
