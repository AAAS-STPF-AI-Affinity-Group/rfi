Hello Faisal D'Souza,
The initiative to allow legalized theft by way of Ai because of false claims by criminally
irresponsible tech business people is not something the United States government shouldallow. 
Many people have already suffered irreparable harm because of Ai, whether by way of mass
layoffs or because of materials with legal copyrights being stolen, scrapped, exploited,misappropriated, and more. There have also been safety issues because of misinformation andfraud due to the use of Ai. 
Copyright protections are an essential safeguard against predatory business practices that
would harm any person, group, or business. We need stronger laws and regulations to fightagainst the misuse of this technology, whether Ai, generative Ai, or AGI.
 
You may have closed the comment section, but this fight has only just begun, and rest assuredthat we the people outnumber those who seek to threaten the United States with Ai, whetherforeign or domestic.
 
Protect the United States. Do not support Ai.
Sincerely,
James
