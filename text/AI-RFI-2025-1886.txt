General Comment
Letting ai consum e copyrighted m edia will be the end of a significant am ount of people's livelihoods, it would be the end of a significant
am ount of people's liberties, it is an evil trying to overturn the basic right of ownership of what you create. Do not let this pass, there isn't a
future in ai, but there is a future in people.
