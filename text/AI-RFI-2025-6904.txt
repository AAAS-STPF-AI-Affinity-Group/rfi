General Comment
I donâ€™t want to live in a world where nothing is m ade by hum ans and everything is m anipulated through an algorithm . Additionally, not just
artists and creators are being stolen from , but the average person too. This technology has no used besides scam m ing and m anipulating
people and cutting m ore people out of work. If the United States supports this, we fall even further and generations will be left behind
other countries.
