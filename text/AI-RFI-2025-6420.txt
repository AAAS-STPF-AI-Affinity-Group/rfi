General Comment
Unless the use of generative AI can be regulated and proven ethical to use that doesn't infringe on the copyrights and tradem arks of others
and Individuals work, I cannot support this act. This goes against all artists from  our m odern day to in our past, Including but not lim ited
too, gam e designers, anim ators, painters, sculptures, digital painters, photographers, videographers, alternative m edium  artists. 
Allow AI to aid us where it is actually needed, like m edical, engineering, weapons, m ilitary and autom obiles for exam ple. Not where it
hinders creatives and does not solve any current problem s, only to evidentially create m ore.
