General Comment
This is an absolutely asinine double standard. Why bother having copywriten work at all if we don't enforce it for tech com panies? If I
can't use Disney characters in fliers to prom ote m y business, why does som e giant com pany get to use as a central piece of their business
m odel? This is unfair to sm all business owners like m yself.
