AI does not need to be general AI for it to be dangerous. We already have massive learning 
programs that can effectively addict and ensnare humans for hours or days. Current AI can 
produce emotions and media that are ‘better than the real thing,’ and it wi ll only get more and 
more powerful. Without regulation, our people will wear out their lives in front of their computer 
screens, expiring alone in front of that glow, fully convinced to their las breath that this was the 
best, most rewarding possible use o f their lives.
