General Comment
AI is little m ore than a grift perpetrated by tech bros and corporations that has not only thus far failed to m eet expectations and turn a
profit, it has already disrupted the lives and livelihoods of countless Am ericans in creative industries. It is an exploitative, regurgitative
technology devoid of any actual creativity and is thus antithetical to the ideas of progress and innovation that the United States upholds as
tenets of business. The only things it is good for are wasting precious natural resources and putting Am ericans out of work.
