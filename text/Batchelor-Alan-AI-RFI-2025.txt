Do not allow the human capacity to learn, create, and teach to be hamstrung by computer
generated slop designed only to allow producers, accountants and executives to churn out'content' without regard for its value. Do not allow them to stunt human growth by reducingthe value of art, ideas and communication with regurgitated visual and audio noise made by acomputer. Look at youtube, look at kwebbelkop, look at how worthless and absent of value acomputer simply stating out loud what they can see on screen is, especially when the contenton screen is also computer generated.
