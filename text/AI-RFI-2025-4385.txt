General Comment
This is a horrible idea. Copyright law should not be infringed on.
Ai steals from  hum anity taking a source of livelihoods away and this would only fuel it. 
We as a country donâ€™t need it. Any words about national security are a ruse and distraction from  the real purpose of wanting AI to do
this.
Ai is also overhyped and com pletely unreliable as it still is full of errors.
