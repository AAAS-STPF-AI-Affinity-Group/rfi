General Comment
I believe that AI should not be allowed to use creative works that they do not explicitly own. Copyright should cover the use of AI
generation and these com panies should not be allowed to use m aterial that does not belong to them . Even if the product of the generation
does not entirely m atch a copyrighted m aterial, if it uses that m aterial in its generation, then to m e it's the sam e as stealing it. We need to
protect artists and their interests, because if their work is constantly stolen then they will have no incentive to create, and then AI will have
nothing to train on.
