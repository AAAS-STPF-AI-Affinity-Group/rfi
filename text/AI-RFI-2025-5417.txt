General Comment
There’s too m uch ai generated content on social m edias, and it’s getting to the point where it’s hard not to be able to stay away from  it.
Also, ai generated art and writing in general takes away from  actual hum an creativity. There is a lot of AI content farm  slop on YouTube,
and not only that, Windows, Apple, and even art program s/apps are pushing AI-powered features that I don’t want, and I’m  sure a lot of
people don’t want as well. Please do som ething about this.
