General Comment
OpenAI and other such generative AI developm ent groups are essentially asking for access to the inform ation, copyrights, intellectual
property and so on of citizens regardless of their consent or perm ission for what is ultim ately a pursuit that has already been used to
develop a litany scam s, fraud, and harm ful m isinform ation. These private enterprises want to skip proper channels of seeking perm ission
for the use of the inform ation they desire, and so they seek to use the Federal governm ent to perm it them  to skip a series of processes that
are in place to protect our rights and freedom s - processes that are referred to here as "unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents". Those
"burdensom e requirem ents" are in place to prevent unwarranted data acquirem ent. 
No organization, corporation or otherwise, should be given this sort of carte blanche over our data and creative pursuits (the latter being
our freedom  of expression) if we do not desire it. Couching this in argum ents about China's place in AI developm ent is loaded - asking us
to prefer our own federal governm ent to be ruled by tyranny in the face of another tyrannical entity - this does not protect our dem ocracy
but excuse our governm ent's slide towards tyranny and thus justifying it as an answer to tyranny. This cannot be allowed.
