 Comment by Massive Bio, Inc. on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  
(Submitted via Regulations.gov on February  10, 2025)  
 
I. Introduction  
Massive Bio, Inc . appreciates the opportunity to respond to the National Science Foundation 
(NSF) Request for Information (RFI) regarding the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
Action Plan (“Plan”). We strongly support the Executive Order of January 23, 2025 (E.O. 14179), 
which aims to remove barriers to American leadership in AI and create a policy environment that 
fosters innovative private -sector solutions.  
 
As an AI -driven healthcare technology and clinical research organization, Massive Bio specializes 
in decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), advanced data analytics, and the application of large 
language models to help sponsors, investigators, and healthcare providers rapidly match patients 
to clinical trials. Our Synergy -AI platform harnesses next -generation AI techniques for data 
integration, enabling sponsors to accelerate research timelines, reduce costs, and generate new 
discoveries more efficiently. By leveraging public -private partnerships and a modular technology 
architecture, we believe our work aligns closely with the Administration’s priority areas for 
sustaining and enhancing America’s AI competitiveness.  
 
Below, we provide specific input across a range of RFI priorities —hardware and chips , data 
centers , model development , open -source initiatives , explainability , cybersecurity , privacy , 
risks, regulation, and governance , national security , R&D , workforce development , innovation 
and competition , procurement , and international collaboration —to remove unnecessary 
regulatory hurdles, support private -sector -led innovation , and strengthen U.S. global leadership 
in AI -based healthcare.  
 
II. Massive Bio’s AI -Driven Approach in Healthcare and Clinical Research  
1. Synergy -AI Platform  
o Comprehensive AI Ecosystem : Our Synergy -AI platform uses large language 
models (LLMs) and advanced analytics to automate clinical trial recruitment and 
retention for patients in any therapeutic area.  
o Federated Learning and Privacy : We incorporate federated learning principles to 
safeguard patient data while continuously improving our algorithms. This approach 
meets HIPAA requirements, fosters strong partnerships, and underscores the 
innovation  possible under clearly defined, pro -growth regulatory frameworks.  
2. Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs)  
o Scaling and Resilience : Our decentralized approach leverages telehealth, mobile 
clinics, and remote monitoring devices to engage patients in all types of 
communities, improving clinical trial recruitment while reducing many of the 
logistical hurdles associated with traditional research.  
o Regulatory Streamlining : We strongly advocate for clear, flexible guidelines that 
encourage the innovation  needed to optimize clinical research and deliver 
meaningful patient benefits without undue administrative burdens.  
3. Innovation for All Patients  
o Broad Patient Access : Through partnerships with community health networks,

 pharmacies, local clinics, and academic sites, Massive Bio’s hub-and-spoke  model 
extends trial access nationwide, advancing next -generation approaches in real -
world environments.  
o Efficiency in Research : By leveraging our platform ’s adaptability, we can engage 
patients efficiently and reliably, helping ensure no opportunity for discovery is lost 
due to outdated systems or restrictive policies.  
 
III. Recommendations and Alignment with the RFI Priorities  
Below, we highlight specific policy areas raised in the RFI and how Massive Bio’s experiences and 
insights can inform the forthcoming AI Action Plan . 
 
1. Hardware and Data Centers  
• Recommendation : Strengthen public -private collaborations  to expand access to high -
performance computing (HPC) resources in healthcare. Tax incentives or matching grants 
would let more AI -focused firms employ advanced computing for medical research and 
large -scale model development.  
• Massive Bio Alignment : Our Synergy -AI platform processes large volumes of clinical and 
real-world data, benefiting from HPC capacity. Upgrading HPC infrastructure lowers 
computational costs  and accelerates the development of breakthrough healthcare 
solutions.  
 
2. Energy Consumption and Efficiency  
• Recommendation : Encourage energy -efficient AI  model training and edge -computing 
practices that minimize data -transfer needs. Create incentives for AI developers and data 
center operators to adopt environmentally conscious HPC solutions.  
• Massive Bio Alignment : By leveraging federated learning  and on -device processing, we 
reduce energy use and bandwidth demands while preserving performance and data 
privacy.  
 
3. Model Development and Open -Source Initiatives  
• Recommendation : Increase federal investment in open -source frameworks  for AI in 
healthcare. Establish guidelines that preserve patient privacy while motivating open data 
models (e.g., HL7 FHIR, OMOP) to simplify system interoperability.  
• Massive Bio Alignment : We use open standards, such as FHIR and CDISC, to connect with 
existing health IT systems, thus enhancing efficiency and innovation  in clinical trial 
operations.  
 
4. Explainability, Assurance, and Trust  
• Recommendation : Create best -practice guidelines and voluntary standards for 
explainable AI  in high -stakes areas (e.g., healthcare, defense) while avoiding rigid 
mandates that inhibit private -sector innovation . 
• Massive Bio Alignment : Our clinical approach includes real -time oversight by medical 
experts and curated feedback loops to maintain accuracy and ensure validated outputs 
from AI -driven processes.

 5. Cybersecurity and Data Privacy  
• Recommendation : Craft robust cybersecurity and privacy frameworks specific to AI in 
healthcare, encouraging encryption, identity management, and secure data -sharing to 
mitigate risks while supporting innovation . 
• Massive Bio Alignment : We maintain HIPAA, GDPR, and national security compliance, 
using zero -trust security and robust encryption to protect patient information within 
distributed AI workflows.  
 
6. Regulation and Governance  
• Recommendation : Streamline and coordinate federal AI guidance  (FDA, NIH, NSF, ONC) to 
reduce fragmentation. Clear, forward -thinking policies let companies innovate freely while 
meeting patient safety standards.  
• Massive Bio Alignment : A unified, flexible regulatory ecosystem can accelerate AI -driven 
solutions for trial enrollment, real -world evidence, and emergency preparedness.  
 
7. National Security and Defense  
• Recommendation : Advance AI innovation for rapid response in potential pandemics or 
biosecurity events. Reinforce public -private partnerships to ensure the best emerging 
solutions can scale in critical situations.
