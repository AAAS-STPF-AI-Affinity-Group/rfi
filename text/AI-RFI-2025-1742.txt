General Comment
I'm  an independent artist and have huge concerns about generative AI. It's been built on stolen stolen art that working Am ericans have
created, com pletely disregarding intellectual copyright laws. As som eone that m akes their living from  their art, I need these gen AI
program s to be opt in only, with fair com pensation if som eone chooses to do so. Creative jobs are disappearing, being replaced by Gen
AI, which is a com plete affront to the people who's work is needed to build the AI in the first place. I also ask that we consider the
extrem e water and energy dem ands of AI, and look to solutions for m itigating the dem and. Resources are finite, and to use so m uch for
som ething that puts people out of work while providing a lesser algorithm ic com pilation of better art, m akes no sense.
