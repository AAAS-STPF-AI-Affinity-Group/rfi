General Comment
AI has been over-hyped and over-saturated as this "m agical" tool to do spectacular things when in reality, it just takes what hum an-m ade
concepts and artwork, and regurgitates them  without the hum an-m ade aspects, essentially deleting and stealing hard-working efforts m ade
by others. Those who sings its praises do not see its potential harm  it does in the long run for our planet and people's livelihoods. Or that
they just want to benefit from  others' suffering or from  other people's hard-work.
They sim ply do not offer any value to anyone except for those who sees other people as "content" or "resources" to feed into their AI
m achine.
In sum m ary, AI is tool thieves uses to steal from  others, there is no other angle to look at it from . And it holds no m eaningful place to exist
for people.
