General Comment
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the ability to revolutionize society in the following years. Here are the areas that this adm inistration should
focus on concerning AI:
-Ensure that both sm aller and larger AI firm s have an equal playing field to advance AI. It should not be solely lim ited to "big tech."
-Ensure that user privacy is at the forefront of AI. Exam ining both local-processing and cloud-hosted AI solutions are key on this.
-Ensure that inform ation distributed by AI is accurate and as neutral and free of bias as possible, ensuring that the public has the ability to
know what inform ation is being prom oted and dem oted over AI.
-Ensure that AI is being used for ethical purposes and used to supplem ent, not replace hum an intelligence.
-Ensure that as m uch of AI can be "Am erican Intelligence", with servers hosted in the USA, program m ers residing in the USA, and that
AI investm ents are m ade in Am erica first.
-AI and DOGE can work together to find ways to utilize AI to m ake the governm ent run m ore efficiently.
