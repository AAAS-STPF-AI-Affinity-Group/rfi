General Comment
Generative AI cannot be allowed to use other peopleâ€™s artwork, photos, m edia, etc. unrestricted and without perm ission. This is a
m onum ental infringem ent of personal property and creative rights and can only lead to people in creative fields losing their livelihoods and
eventually the general death and erasure of hum an m ade creative works. Independent artists are already seeing huge losses and work is
drying up as com panies are using AI as a cheap m indless alternative to em ploying actual people. The proliferation of AI im ages online has
also caused witch hunts against legitim ate artists leading to disparagem ent, defam ation, and even death threats due the m istaking of real art
for AI.
