General Comment
I'm  frustrated by this executive order. AI is abusing copyrighted m aterial and this is going to drain the creation of innovative ideas m ore
than any restrictions on AI would. He would need to push back against such an industry rather than em brace it. We should force AI
com panies to properply com pensate thoose they get training data from  rather than offer them  m ore oppertunities.
