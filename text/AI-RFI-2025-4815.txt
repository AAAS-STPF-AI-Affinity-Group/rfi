General Comment
Large com pany lawyers and lobbyists will argue in favor of expanding the net of AI, yet they are wrong. The average Am erican will have
their privacy and rights violated every second of every day by AI if AI is not kept in check. AI can be a wonderful tool to advance
hum anity, rem oving som e of our burdens in the workforce. However, it is not currently being used for that purpose. It is used to plagiarize
and steal art, writing, m usic, and intellectual property from  Am ericans, and people all around the world, for the pure purpose of advancing
a profit m argin. Large tech com panies are pushing for private power grids to fund m assive, expensive, and global warm ing accelerating
data centers specifically to train unintelligible AI bots. While m illions of Am ericans see their power utilities increase in price to record
highs, Large corporations are stealing their electricity to train AI slop that isn't worth the m icrochip they're processed by.
