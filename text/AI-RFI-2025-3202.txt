General Comment
Hello, I am  a college student who has com m issioned art before, and I just saw this notice. I do not think this work is ethical. Artists have a
right to their work just as m uch as other craftsm en. If their work is replicated, it norm ally takes a hum an to build up the skill to do so. AI is
not the sam e. I believe artists should have the right to sell or opt their work in for AI training. Does this not im pede on copyright laws?
Should artists not have the right to patent their work, which took them  years to develop the skills for? Even if a m achine takes also takes
tim e to learn from  these photos, they can m ass produce the work m uch quicker than a hum an. Yes, it is m uch m ore efficient, and very
appealing, but it steals jobs from  us. The originality which sets us apart from  each other is being erased. This is m onopolizing our work and
it isn't right. Even m anufacturers have patents, why can't we have the sam e protections? Everyone has to build up their business in som e
way; this is hurting free enterprise. This is what I believe. Thank you for your tim e.
