General Comment
As a creative who is heavily involved in the creative com m unity, I feel that generative AI is a great insult to what I and m any others stand
for. It is unethical and exploitative to scrape the work of billions of creators without their consent for technology intended to replace them .
It is the threat to the livelihood of countless Am ericans and has been way overhyped as the future of this country. I wish of the law to side
with the working class creators and not corporate giants of big tech.
