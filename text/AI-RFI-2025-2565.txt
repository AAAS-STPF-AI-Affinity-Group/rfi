Submission to the White House AI Action Plan Request for Information (RFI) 
Subject: Advancing AI Governance in Financial Systems: A National Policy Framework 
for U.S. Leadership 
Submitted by:  
Garrett Wasny, MA, CMC, CITP/FITP  
Founder, GAAAP.AI 
I. Introduction: AI Financial Governance as a National Imperative
The global AI race is not just about innovation—it’s about financial stability, 
national security, and U.S. economic leadership. AI-driven automation is already 
reshaping global financial markets, and without immediate governance measures, the 
risks of systemic AI-driven fraud, cyberattacks, and biased financial models could erode 
investor trust and weaken America’s economic dominance. 
Just as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act strengthened financial integrity after the early 2000s 
corporate scandals, a comprehensive AI financial governance framework is now 
essential to sustain U.S. leadership in AI and protect national security. 
As AI systems become deeply embedded in financial decision-making, the integrity, 
stability, and global competitiveness of U.S. markets depend on ensuring AI 
transparency, accountability, and trust. 
With AI projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 
2030 —equivalent to 13.5% of global GDP, rivaling the combined economies of 
Germany, the UK, and Japan—the U.S. must lead in setting AI financial governance 
standards to secure its competitive edge. 
I submit this proposal as part of the White House AI Action Plan RFI, outlining a 
national AI financial governance framework modeled after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
(SOX)—a policy intervention that restored investor confidence and financial integrity in 
the wake of corporate scandals. 
3 


This framework, built on 54 principles from my GAAAP.AI governance model , will:  
✅Enhance U.S. AI competitiveness by ensuring trust in AI-driven financial systems.
✅Protect national security and economic resilience by mitigating AI-related risks,
including cybersecurity vulnerabilities and financial fraud.
✅Balance innovation and regulation  by safeguarding financial integrity without
stifling private sector AI growth.
✅Create new economic opportunities  for the accounting profession as AI auditors,
establishing a new legacy franchise and revenue stream for CPAs in the AI era.
Key areas covered in this submission:  
 📌 National AI transparency and accountability framework  
 📌 AI-driven financial risk management and cybersecurity resilience  
 📌 Workforce transformation and economic opportunities in AI auditing  
 📌 Strategic industry-government-academia partnerships for AI financial governance

II. The Need for AI Financial Governance in the U.S. AI Action Plan
1. AI as an Economic & National Security Priority
Financial markets are the backbone of U.S. economic leadership, and AI-driven 
automation is now central to: 
●Banking & investment management (AI-driven risk models, algorithmic trading)
●Regulatory compliance (AI-powered fraud detection, Know Your Customer
(KYC) systems)
●Tax & public finance (AI-enhanced auditing and risk assessment)
However, unchecked AI models pose risks to financial stability: 
●Opaque AI decision-making undermines investor confidence.
●AI bias in lending and credit models can exacerbate economic inequality.
●AI-powered cyber threats increase risks of systemic fraud and market
manipulation.
A national AI financial governance framework will prevent economic disruptions, 
enhance global AI leadership, and protect U.S. national security interests.

2. Learning from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): A Blueprint for AI
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) restored confidence in financial systems by 
mandating corporate transparency and accountability. Similarly, AI audits can 
ensure that AI financial systems remain trustworthy, auditable, and aligned with 
national economic priorities. 
Key lessons from SOX applied to AI governance:  
✅Mandatory AI audits – Just as SOX introduced independent financial audits, a
similar AI fre would require third-party AI audits to assess fairness, accuracy , and
compliance.
✅AI governance officers – Similar to SOX compliance officers, firms deploying AI in
finance should appoint AI governance officers to oversee  responsible AI use.
✅Public AI disclosures – Companies using AI in financial systems should publish
annual AI risk reports, ensuring investor confidence and public accountability.
III. Proposed National AI Financial Governance Framework
This framework directly supports White House AI Action Plan goals, ensuring U.S. 
leadership in AI innovation while protecting financial system integrity. 
1. National AI Transparency & Accountability Standards
📌AI transparency is not just about compliance—it is a foundation for public trust in 
AI-driven financial systems. Without clear ethical standards, AI risks exacerbating 
economic inequality, reducing financial inclusion, and undermining investor confidence. 
📌 Mandatory AI Audits: Independent verification of AI systems for fairness, 
transparency, and compliance with U.S. financial regulations. 
📌 Explainable AI Models: Require AI systems to document decision-making 
processes, reducing financial opacity and regulatory uncertainty. 
📌 Annual AI Risk Disclosures: Firms using AI in finance must publish annual risk 
assessments akin to SOX financial reporting. 
6 


2. AI Financial Risk Management & Cybersecurity Resilience
📌 AI Cyber Threat Preparedness : Mandate cybersecurity stress tests for AI-driven 
financial models to protect against AI-powered fraud.  
 📌 Quantum Computing Readiness: Establish risk mitigation plans for 
post-quantum financial encryption threats.  
 📌 Autonomous AI Decision Oversight: Require financial institutions to monitor and 
audit autonomous AI agents in lending, trading, and fraud detection. 
3. Workforce Transformation & AI Auditing Opportunities
📌 AI Auditing as a CPA Specialization:  Establish AI audit certifications for CPAs to 
verify AI model compliance in financial reporting.  
📌 AI Governance as a New Revenue Stream : AI auditing and oversight can become 
a new legacy franchise for CPAs, ensuring their continued relevance in an AI-driven 
economy. 
📌 Collaboration with AI & Accounting Firms: Partner with Big Four firms, AI 
startups, and academia to define industry-wide AI auditing best practices. 
📌By 2030, AI auditing could become a $5.5 billion industry, opening new revenue 
streams for CPAs, regulatory technology firms, and financial compliance professionals. 
With targeted workforce training and certification programs, AI governance can create 
sustainable, high-skill jobs that future-proof the U.S. accounting industry against 
automation-driven displacement. 
4. Strategic Industry-Government-Academia Partnerships📌 Cross-Sector AI Financial Governance Task Force: Establish a joint task force 
between regulators, financial firms, and AI experts to shape AI governance policies.  
 📌 AI Research Grants for Financial Governance: Fund university-led research on 
AI-driven fraud prevention and ethical AI design in finance. 
 📌 International AI Governance Leadership. By collaborating with international 
regulatory bodies (OECD, G20, and IMF), America can shape AI financial governance 
standards before other nations impose competing frameworks that may limit U.S. 
innovation   
7 


IV. Metrics for Success: Ensuring Effective Implementation
To ensure the success of the AI financial governance framework, the U.S. government 
should track:  
 📊 Adoption Rates – Percentage of financial institutions implementing AI auditing 
standards. 
 🔍 Reduction in AI-Related Financial Risks – Measurable decrease in AI-driven 
financial fraud, bias cases, and systemic failures. 
 📢 Transparency Metrics – Increased public confidence in AI governance, based on 
AI audit disclosures. 
 🏛 Global AI Policy Influence – U.S. leadership in setting international AI financial 
governance standards. 
V. Conclusion: A Unified Approach to AI Financial Governance
The United States has a once-in-a-generation opportunity  to lead in AI financial 
governance, just as Sarbanes-Oxley redefined corporate financial transparency. 
By integrating AI oversight into financial regulatory frameworks , we can ensure 
transparency, protect national security, and maintain U.S. economic dominance in 
AI-driven finance. 
The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the U.S. Department of 
the Treasury  should lead the development of a National AI Financial Governance 
Framework, ensuring that AI-driven financial systems align with national security, 
economic competitiveness, and regulatory integrity. 
To achieve this, OSTP and Treasury should establish a National AI Financial 
Governance Task Force, bringing together key federal agencies—including the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Reserve, Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
(FinCEN), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)—to: 
✅Harmonize AI financial reporting standards with global economic leadership
priorities.
✅Develop a unified AI risk assessment, auditing, and compliance framework  to
protect financial markets from algorithmic bias, systemic instability, and AI-driven fraud.
✅Ensure interagency collaboration  to create clear, enforceable standards that
balance AI innovation with financial security and investor trust.

By implementing this cohesive, cross-agency approach, the United States can 
solidify its position as the global leader in AI-driven finance, ensuring transparency, 
accountability, and responsible AI deployment in the financial sector. 
The GAAAP.AI 54 Principles provide a foundational roadmap for integrating AI 
governance with financial regulations, reinforcing trust and accountability in AI-powered 
financial systems.  
The U.S. cannot afford to wait.  
AI financial governance is not just a regulatory issue—it is a national economic 
and security imperative.  
Failure to act now could result in the erosion of investor trust, increased financial fraud, 
and the U.S. losing its leadership position in AI-driven financial markets. To secure 
America’s AI dominance, we must act decisively. Next Steps:  
To move forward, I propose the formation of a White House AI Financial 
Governance Working Group, bringing together policymakers, industry leaders, 
and AI experts to refine this framework and establish clear implementation 
priorities.  
This initiative would help define actionable AI financial governance policies that balance 
innovation with security. I welcome the opportunity to participate in such discussions 
and contribute further insights. 
I look forward to working with policymakers, regulators, and industry leaders to ensure 
the U.S. remains the global leader in AI-driven finance while safeguarding trust, 
transparency, and stability.
