General Comment
I object to any and all uses of generative AI. Not only is it based on outright theft from  copyright holders, it also has been repeatedly
proven to be factually incorrect the vast m ajority of the tim e, which contributes to the spread of m isinform ation and creates a dangerous
setting for all people.
More im portantly, it's been proven that generative AI is reliant upon exploited labor of those who are already m arginalized, and its use of
energy resources is set to hasten our clim ate's dem ise. 
All of these reasons are excellent for refusing to allow it to continue in any way, and I can't urge you strongly enough to reject these
com panies' bids to continue to exploit and harm  people and our planet while creating chaos with lies and m isinform ation.
