General Comment
AI com panies should not be allowed to violate copyright to drain their m odels. That is blatant theft from  the general public, and to what
end? So som e billionaires can get even richer? So bad com panies can take advantage of people m ore? So it's easier for scam m ers to trick
people? So we can replace everything with spam  and m isinform ation? So we can waste billions on power and destroythe environm ent?
None of that is worth it. Generative AI com pletely unethical.
