General Comment
I am  an author and dabble in art...the last thing I want is the unauthorized, unattributed, and uncom pensated scraping or use of m y work to
train/em bolden ai. I do not want m y work used by ai in any capacity and am  frankly disgusted that m y own governm ent would scrape user
data in such a way. Pay for content if you want to use it and DO NOT ALLOW HALLUCINATING TRASH PROGRAMS TO
MAKE ANY DECISIONS REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATIOB OF ANY GOVERMENT SECTOR.
