General Comment
I do not support OpenAI, Google, or any other entity to have access to copyrighted works for the use of AI training. Large institutions
already take advantage of copyright, patents, and tradem arks to block others from  m aking genuine product even if they sit on it and don't
do anything with it, and now they want free access to everything for profit at the expense of those people.
