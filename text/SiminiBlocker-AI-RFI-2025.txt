Hello, 
I'm writing regarding the request for comment about the "AI Action Plan." I'm an illustrator. I
rely on owning the copyright to my work. It is my work. Allowing AI companies to usecopyrighted material without compensation or permission is straight forward theft. THey areplagiarising our work and making billions while artists are pushed out of their jobs. It'sdisgusting. The AI bubble is already about to crater. The programs cannot do what theypromise, and even if they could, that does not justify theft. Beyond that, there are massiveconcerns for the way they allow for the spread of disinformation and propaganda, as well andviolent images and revenge porn/ CSAM. Thi technology does not merit any special carve outin the laws. It requires far more regulation. not less.
Thank you,Simini Blocker
