General Comment
I do not believe AI holds use to us in its current state for vast m ajority of cases, apart from  m edicinal uses, all current sources of learning
algorithm s in the pat two years have proved deeply unprofitable, with no clear future for it to reach, nor do I believe it would be able to
feasibly do so, requiring untold am ounts of data forcibly harvested while at sane tim e never understanding any inform ation apart from
barest details such as form atting, as well as stealing such large am ounts of jobs that we would face econom ic downturn on the levels of the
early 1930s
