General Comment
We need to prioritize safety, security, cybersecurity, and education in the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. 
Safety:
A detailed plan with step by step procedures need to be in place to counteract various safety issues such as lives, environm ental (inside
and outside), physical, fire, and extrem e weather conditions. 
Security and Cybersecurity:
A very detailed defense-in-depth strategy with zero trust policy (physical, network, logical, virtual, etc) needs to be in place to protect our
AI infrastructure from  both internal and external security and cybersecurity attacks. 
Education:
We need to begin developing and deploying specialized workforce skillset by establishing various educational (elem entary through college)
and vocational training program s as well as apprenticeships for US citizens interested in developing, m astering, and applying artificial
intelligence, safety, security, cybersecurity, and network security skills.
