General Comment
Allowing gen-ai specifically to have unrestricted access to im ages is a poor idea. Many digital artists already struggle with people using
various gen ai system s to create art in their distinct style without their consent. This m ight not m atter to those who only care about m aking
m oney, but keep in m ind that because of this, system s are being designed to deliberately sabotage gen ai in contrast. Regardless of this
being a financial or creative issue, there will be heavy backlash if this is carried out. Art should rem ain a hum an expression.
