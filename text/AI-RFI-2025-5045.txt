General Comment
Do Not Allow This!!! AI steals from  the livelihoods and passions of am ericans and profits entirely off of theft. Allowing OpenAI to have
im m unity will show everyone that not only do you not care for the passions and work of people, but that you do not care for the people
them selves. 
On top of this, it is likely every other AI com pany will follow suit and the quality of everything that follows will decrease. Artists and
Writers are what sells everything you want to be sold, they create what you want to sell, and they are responsible for m aintaining the
quality Am erica so proudly boasts. 
Allowing OpenAI com plete freedom  from  consequences via lawsuits regarding copywrite infringem ent is an im m ensely slippery slope to
not only reducing the quality of everything, but to attacking and disbanding the livelihoods of m any, m any people. Not only does AI like
this have a place in our future, its presence now fully assaults the well being of our future.
