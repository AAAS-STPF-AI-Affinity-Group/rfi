Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  
Executive Summary  
The rapid advancement and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United 
States and globally necessitate a critical examination of its current trajectory 
and future development. Classical AI, built on perceptron -based neural 
networks and powered by  energy-intensive GPU/SIMD processors, has driven 
remarkable progress over the past decade but is now reaching its limits due to 
unsustainable energy consumption and escalating costs. Examples such as 
the $500 billion Stargate joint venture and the market disruption caused by 
DeepSeek’s efficiency breakthrough highlight the financial and competitive 
pressures facing classical AI. Beyond economics, the opacity of classical AI 
systems raises significant concerns about transparency, trust, and potential 
biases, affecting individual lives and national security. Meanwhile, the 
concentration of AI power among a few major corporations threatens to limit 
access and diversity in foundational AI models, risking monopolistic control 
over a technology critical to the na tion’s future.  
To address these challenges, the United States must invest in both sustaining 
classical AI and pioneering its successor, such as neuromorphic computing, 
which promises greater efficiency, reduced energy use, and transparent 
decision-making. Additionally, c ommon-sense regulations are needed to 
ensure AI transparency, protect against discrimination, and democratize 
access to AI technologies. By learning from precedents like the EU’s GDPR 
and historical interventions such as the AT&T breakup, the U.S. can main tain 
its leadership in AI innovation while safeguarding its citizens and national 
interests.  


Page 2 of 8 Innovation in non -classical AI:  
The AI industry is currently dominated by classical AI.   To be clear, classical AI 
refers to systems that are centered around perceptron -based neural networks 
(the model) and are accelerated by GPU/SIMD type processors.   While it is 
undeniable that this classical AI has made incredible advances over the past 
decade, it is also true the scale we are currently operating at is pushing 
classical AI to a breaking point.   Chief amongst the problems posed by 
classical AI is the tremendous energy consumption of these systems.   In fact, 
two recent events underscore the pr oblem we face with classical AI systems…  
1.The announcement of the Stargate joint venture.   While investment in AI
infrastructure is in the national interest, the announced $500B
expenditure by Stargate is primarily driven by the massive scale of the
data centers needed to house classical AI system s.  The huge energy
requirements and volumetric space required to accommodate classical
AI is clearly evident in the scale of investment required to house these
systems.   Adjusted for inflation, the cost of this AI infrastructure is 10X
higher than the con struction costs of the Hoover Dam.
2.A relatively obscure Chinese AI company, DeepSeek, announced a
breakthrough in AI efficiency which resulted in a staggering $1T loss in
the US/Euro tech markets.   This is a clear indicator that AI efficiency is
front and center on the minds of the entire A I industry.   The exorbitant
cost of classical AI is already painful today, and it will only continue to
get worse as our foundational models continue to grow in size and AI
continues on it’s blistering pace to embed itself in American society.


Page 3 of 8 Although the two events discussed above discuss the financial costs of 
classical AI, there is another ‘cost’ to classical AI that is just as 
concerning.   Considering that the concepts associated with classical AI are 
more than 50 years old, and that the en tire industry is compelled to discover a 
new approach to AI, it follows that there is a competition amongst developed 
nations to discover what comes next.   Just as the steam engine gave way to 
the internal combustion engine, we can be certain that somewher e, some 
group of researchers, private entity or government will break through the 
barriers posed by classical AI.   Whoever achieves this will harvest not only an 
economic benefit, but quite likely a military benefit as well.  
Consider Intel Corporation and the technological advantage that was afforded 
the United States by leading the world in the microprocessor 
revolution.   Those benefits accrued for decades and are only now starting to 
diffuse.   For AI, the stakes will be even  larger.   At this moment it is clear that 
China is pushing hard in AI R&D.   They have already surpassed the US in the 
important metric of producing published research focused on AI.   In fact, in 
2017 China announced their ‘New Generation Artificial Intelli gence 
Development Plan’ in which they seek to lead all nations in AI by 2030.   They 
are well on their way.  
In order for the US to maintain AI superiority, we must invest in both classical 
AI systems as well as funding the research for what will inevitably replace 
classical AI systems.   One of the more promising emerging technologies is 
referred to as ‘nueromorp hic computing’.   Neuromorphic computing systems 
leverage the most contemporary neuroscience to fully unlock the superior 
processing and intelligence of the human brain.   The benefits include massive 
reductions in energy use and implementation costs.   Additional benefits 
include full model transparency so decisions so that human operators and 
government regulators can have higher confidence in the use of AI throughout 
American industry.  


Page 4 of 8 There should be no doubt that the classical AI systems that are being adopted 
across every corner of American industry will give way to something more 
efficient and even more powerful.   The US must proactively make the 
investments necessary to ensure we ar e the nation to discover the next engine 
that will power the AI industry.  
The need for AI Transparency:  
AI is continuing to be rapidly adopted by nearly every industry in the US and 
worldwide.   Consequently, more and more decisions that impact the lives of 
citizens throughout the world is being relegated to AI systems that are hidden 
and out of view of the p ublic.   The impact of decisions made by these classical 
AI systems can be acutely personal, as in the approval or denial of a loan 
application.   Consider too, the use of AI to develop a treatment plan for a life -
threatening disease.   It is understandable t hat both patient and doctor would 
want the very highest level of confidence in this type of AI system.   Beyond the 
impact to individuals, the decisions made by AI systems can also have 
implications to the national security of the United States.   For exampl e, 
imagine an AI system controlling a fire control system for US Air Defense.   At 
the critical moment of designating an unknown aircraft as ‘friend’ or ‘foe’ it is 
vitally important to have confidence in the AI system that is making that 
determination and the basis for its recommendation.   The wrong decision in 
this type of scenario can have catastrophic consequences.  
Unfortunately, the underlying mathematics of classical AI systems make it 
very difficult, perhaps impossible to clearly understand the basis for any 
recommendation that comes from AI systems.   Indeed, we have already seen 
documented examples of unintended bias creeping into AI systems that can 
cause damage to individual citizens.   The resulting lack of trust in AI threatens 
to limit the further adoption of AI by certain industries, in spite of the 
efficiencies that can be realized through the adoption of AI .   


Page 5 of 8 Beyond the individual, lack of transparency in AI systems can lead to large 
scale bias against entire groups of our population.   In other words, opacity in 
AI systems can lead to widespread discrimination that is very hard to 
detect.   The remedy to all of these problems is to provide common sense 
regulation of AI that is used in applications that can impact individuals and 
our national security.   The consequences of an AI system making the wrong 
choice while sorting freshly harvested produce is one thing, b ut the 
consequence of an AI system discriminating against a class of individuals is 
quite another.   The US has created laws that prohibit discrimination, but what 
happens when that discrimination is deeply embedded in a system that has 
no way of being insp ected?  
The European Union has already implemented important safeguards from AI 
systems for its citizens.   The ‘Right to an Explanation’ clause of GPDR (General 
Data Protection Regulation) stipulates that individuals have a right not to be 
subject to a decision ba sed solely on automated processing.   According to 
GPDR, if automated decision processing (AI) is used, affected individuals 
have the right to obtain meaningful information about the logic 
involved.   Unfortunately, the decision logic in classical AI systems  is difficult 
to ascertain.   This leads to businesses avoiding the use of AI, not because it 
provides the wrong decisions but rather because the decisions it provides 
cannot be explained.  
Until we move beyond classical AI and the opacity that surrounds it’s 
decisions, common sense regulations must be put in place to protect 
individuals.   In addition to appropriate regulations, investments in the 
development of AI that exhibits full transpar ency in the decision process 
should be undertaken.  
Democratization of AI:  


Page 6 of 8 AI systems are growing at an unprecedented scale.   As evidenced by the 
recent Stargate announcement, investments of $500B will be made to house 
the massive AI systems that are being designed for near -term use.   The 
massive capital expenditures to power AI aren’t the only problem.   These 
massive AI systems require equally massive amounts of information to train 
the AI systems.   The sheer size of the capital investment and amount of data 
needed to train these systems presents a significant barrier to entry in  the AI 
market, especially at the highest end where foundational AI models rule the 
day.   Already today we see the emergence of a highly concentrated group of 
companies that can afford to operate at this scale.   This group includes 
corporations like Google , Microsoft and Meta and a few others in the US and 
abroad.   As we go forward, it is possible for this group of AI ‘power players’ to 
further consolidate as the market shakes out and the most successful models 
begin to achieve market dominance.  
The US has long recognized and regulated the existence of monopolistic 
enterprises.   This is especially true when those enterprises control critical 
commodities or infrastructure that are of national importance.   This same 
approach must be taken with AI.   Equal access and diversity of choices in 
foundational AI models must be part of a plan for the US going 
forward.   Furthermore, both users of these systems and the government 
officials who will regulate these systems should have access to decision logic 
or the underlying construction of the models.   This is particularly true for any 
models that use post processing ‘tune’ decisions towards some perceived 
ideal.  
The break -up of AT& T serves as an example of how the US Government has 
intervened to protect the delivery of critical services to the citizens of the 
US.  In the case of AI, the stakes may be even higher.   Imagine the potential 
implications if our most frequently used ‘sourc e of truth’ has deeply 
embedded ulterior motives.   Already we see the potential for biased media to 


Page 7 of 8 impact matters of national significance, like US elections.   Biases in AI 
systems, whether intentional or not, can have long reaching impacts on the 
US.  Here again, common sense regulations that work to democratize 
(providing access to, choice of and insi ght to) the emerging realm of AI will be 
in the best interest of the US and governments of developed nations.  
Call to Action  
The US can create opportunities to lead the world in cutting edge AI based on 
neuromorphic comput ing by taking these three steps.  
•Fund Research and Development: Allocate significant federal funding to
accelerate research into neuromorphic computing, supporting
universities, national labs, and private -sector partnerships to unlock its
potential as the next -generation AI technology.
•Incentivize Adoption: Establish grants, tax credits, or public -private
initiatives to encourage industries to transition from energy -intensive
classical AI to neuromorphic systems, reducing costs and
environmental impact.
•Move Neuromorphic  AI to The Edge : The American war figh ter deserves
the best technolo gy available to achieve their mission goals.
Neuromorphic computing provides unique capabilities in terms of
SWAP (Size Weight and Power) , explainability, and  functionality.   Invest
to projects to bring neuromorphic AI alternatives to the battlefield.
