General Comment
The dam age this will do to arts and culture across the United States and the world is terrifying. 
Protecting copyright m aterials from  being devoured by AI is param ount. This executive order is an equivalent of letting everything from  a
Disney m ovie to a classic country song being fed into a m eat grinder that spews out a worthless im itation with no heart behind it. 
Generative AI technology brings no value, it is only here to be a plagiarism  tool that creates nothing new and destroying the environm ent.
The electricity and water needs of gen AI technology should scare everyone in the age of global warm ing. 
I hope that the artistic legacy of Am erica still m eans som ething to our governm ent officials. 
Protect Am erica's artist's protect the Art.
