General Comment
The Fifth Am endm ent to the Constitution provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just com pensation. This
sells out Am ericans in creative industries to corporations that would use our hard work to create soulless garbage that would m ake our
respectability as a culture tank, and our creative industries suffer. This would be unconstitutional. Protect our right to m ake new things or
all youâ€™ll be left with is ugly tech.
