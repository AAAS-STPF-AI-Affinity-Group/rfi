General Comment
AI is a deeply harm ful and wasteful avenue towards the idea of Am erican progress. In every respect it seeks to hurt and punish the m ost
im portant part of our country, the people. AI should not only be regulated according to our stances on copyright and theft, but should be
further restricted access to works without legal recourse.
