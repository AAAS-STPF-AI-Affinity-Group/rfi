General Comment
I firm ly believe that solidifying the United States of Am erica's position as a global leader in AI is entirely unnecessary. Securing a brighter
future for the United States of Am erica should not have to rely on AI. Rem oving the already established barriers "inhibiting" AI learning
would be utterly destructive regarding ownership of copyrighted m aterials. AI should not be used in the United States' infrastructure. It is a
gim m ick that should hold no place in the governm ent.
