General Comment
Having read the news of President Trum p’s Executive Order regarding AI, I am  disgusted and vehem ently against it. As an Am erican who
has m ade her livelihood through art and m usic, it is horrible that m y work and that of m illions of Am ericans can be stolen and used in AI
learning m odels. AI has no place in the United States. In a tim e of extrem e m isinform ation and environm ental crisis, AI is leading the
charge in false im agery, water waste, revenge porn, and Nazi propaganda, accom m odating fascists in a world where the facts do not
m atch their deluded reality. I do not condone the use of AI, nor the United States governm ent’s insistence on tram pling on the labor of
m illions of people to spread its own agenda. If the governm ent had any respect for the laborers that keep it afloat, it would cease the
efforts to m ake AI a staple of Am erican culture. Thank you.
