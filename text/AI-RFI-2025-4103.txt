General Comment
Any generative AI that requires training on uncom pensated copyrighted works, without the perm ission or cooperation of the original artists
and creators, is a disgusting and offensive proposition, and does not deserve consideration by any decent person. Rushing headlong into
an unproven technology that has never lived up to a single prom ised advantage, all while insisting that it requires breaking the law and
harm ing actual hum an beings, is deeply foolish and a waste of tim e and m oney. I will never support such lawless and wasteful technology.
