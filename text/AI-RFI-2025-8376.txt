General Comment
1) The Anim ation Guild (IATSE Local 839)along with Concept Art Association (CAA), The Hum an Artistry Cam paign, and The
National Cartoonist Society Foundation com m issioned CVL Econom ics, a leading authority in econom ic developm ent and growth, to
conduct a com prehensive survey on the profound im pact of Gen AI on jobs within the entertainm ent industry.
The study, conducted between Novem ber 17 and Decem ber 22, 2023, surveyed 300 C-Suite leaders, senior executives, and m id-level
m anagers across six key entertainm ent industries to better understand how this technology is being used now, how it will be used over the
next three years, and assessing how these technologies will im pact creative workers.
About 21.4% of Film , Television, and Anim ation jobs (or approxim ately 118,500 jobs) are likely to have a sufficient num ber of tasks
affected to be either consolidated, replaced, or elim inated by GenAI in the U.S. by 2026. As the state with the largest industry
em ploym ent and industry concentration (or location quotient), California will be im pacted the m ost (affecting 39,500 jobs) both in total
job disruption nationwide and with respect to its own econom y. New York also has a relatively high em ploym ent concentration and will
see 15,100 film , television, and anim ation jobs affected over the next three years.
2) Analysts explore the Business Value of Generative AI at Gartner Data & Analytics Sum m it, July 29-30 in Sydney. They predicted "At
least 30% of generative AI (GenAI) projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025, due to poor data quality,
inadequate risk controls, escalating costs or unclear business value, according to Gartner, Inc."
3) Goldm an Sachs put out a 31-page-report (titled "Gen AI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?‚Äù) The report covers AI's productivity
benefits (which Goldm an rem arks are likely lim ited), AI's returns (which are likely to be significantly m ore lim ited than anticipated), and
AI's power dem ands (which are likely so significant that utility com panies will have to spend nearly 40% m ore in the next three years to
keep up with the dem and from  hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft).
