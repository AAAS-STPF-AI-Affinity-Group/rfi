The copyright office must affirm that training AI models on copyrighted content is NOT fair use. 
Is this an undue burden on the development of AI technology? No. The future of the overall 
information economy depends on the creators of content being able to profit from their creations. Without human input to train models and provide grounding in fact the development of AI technology will stagnate. All existing data has already been trained on. Strong copyright protections are needed to ensure that there is an incentive to create new data.
