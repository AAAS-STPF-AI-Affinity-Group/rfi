General Comment
As a sm all business owner, I recognize the incredible potential of AI to stream line workflows, enhance creativity, and keep Am erica at the
forefront of technological innovation. However, we m ust ensure that AI developm ent respects intellectual property rights, prom otes fair
com petition, and upholds freedom  of expression.
I urge this adm inistration to take the following critical considerations into account as it shapes AI policy:
1. Protect Copyright & Fair Com pensation: Just as the m usic industry had to adapt after Napster, the publishing industry now faces a
sim ilar challenge with AI. AI m odels should not be allowed to ingest, m onetize, or replicate copyrighted content without proper licensing
and com pensation. A fair and transparent licensing system  for AI training data is essential to ensure that all creators—big and sm all—
benefit from  their work.
2. Prevent AI-Driven Censorship: AI should not be weaponized to silence voices that platform s or corporations disagree with. The use of
AI to suppress certain publishers, viewpoints, or businesses threatens the foundation of a free and open society. Algorithm ic biases m ust
be transparent and subject to public scrutiny to ensure AI upholds, rather than restricts, diverse perspectives.
3. Stop Big Tech from  Exploiting AI to Crush Sm all Businesses: Large tech com panies should not be able to m onopolize AI tools to
elim inate com petition, control distribution, or devalue independent creators. The governm ent m ust ensure that AI benefits all Am ericans,
not just corporate giants. Enforcing strong antitrust m easures will prevent AI from  becom ing a tool for digital gatekeeping and econom ic
consolidation.
4. Make the U.S. a Leader in Ethical AI Developm ent: We should lead in creating a balanced AI ecosystem  that fosters innovation while
safeguarding creativity and ownership. This m eans clear regulations that protect intellectual property without stifling technological growth.
AI should com plem ent hum an creativity, not replace or exploit it.
Am erica is at a crossroads in AI policy. We can either protect the rights of creators, ensure fair com petition, and uphold free speech—or
allow unchecked AI developm ent to strip away these freedom s. Let’s choose the path that sustains innovation while respecting the value
of hum an ingenuity.
Thank you for considering this crucial issue.
