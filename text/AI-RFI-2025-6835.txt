General Comment
The governm ent em powering OpenAI is a huge m iddle finger to artists, writers, m usicians, and copyright law. AI is a sinking ship that
cannot operate without ram pant theft, unchecked power, and environm ental destruction. The governm ent should be dism antling it, not
standing behind it. Do NOT give OpenAI and other AI com panies im m unity from  copyright infringem ent.
