General Comment
Open AI and other AI based com panies violate copyright laws every day with their scanning of m aterials available on the internet to build
their database. Allowing for profit enterprises to utilize copyrighted m aterial to build their generative AI databases which WILL turn profit
at the expense of every resource used to build it. This will destroy over a century of copyright laws that have built the foundation of IP law
in the US. It leaves written publications, m usic creation, and visual artists open to great harm . And the sim ple fact is that it has not been
proven that Gen AI is even necessary. It's largely used to cheat on school work by students, m aking our next generations dum ber than
their international counterparts where gen AI is better regulated. It has also proven to be inherently unreliable in the databases inability to
parse out what is real, what isn't and what is current knowledge vs what is expired or disproven. Generative AI, at this m om ent, is theft,
waste of natural resources, and only serves to leave the US as a weaker com petitor in the global m arket.
