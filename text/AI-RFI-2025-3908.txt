General Comment
Hello, 
I am  a hum ble artist and citizen of this country. I am  very concerned at the seem ingly unregulated growth and im plem entation of AI
technology in our country. There is reckless copyright and privacy infringem ent thanks to AI being trained on data people did not give
explicit consent to. A sim ple Term s of Service is not enough for this gross violation of people's rights. I understand the need of AI for
developing new and innovative technologies, but there is nothing innovative or necessary about exploiting people's privacy. 
As an artist, I am  even m ore appalled at the sheer am ount of hum an artists being exploited for AI art generators. I am  worried that the
current governm ent, in its haste to sustain and enhance Am erica's AI dom inance and to com pete with other nations in the developm ent of
AI, is neglecting the works of hum an artists and potentially ignoring long-standing legal protections afforded to the creations of said hum an
artists.
