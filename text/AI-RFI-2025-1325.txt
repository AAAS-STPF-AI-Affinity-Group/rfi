General Comment
My nam e is Sydney Shields and I am  a m em ber of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High School. I com pleted a sem ester
course on AI and Ethics and studied the im pacts of Generative AI on elem entary schools. EO 14179 will be a m ix of im provem ent and
disruption. Deregulation of AI would benefit elem entary teachers as AI is a great tool for various aspects of their day. However, AI is a
harm ful tool for elem entary-aged students. Education policies should be based on teaching students how to properly use AI and lim iting
student access in Elem entary schools. Students should not have access to AI independently without being m onitored by an adult. In
Elem entary schools, children learn problem -solving and critical thinking skills. Access and abuse of AI can hinder the developm ent of
these skills. In addition, kindergarten to second-grade students donâ€™t always understand that AI is not a person. A study showed that
younger children depicted their at-hom e sm art speakers as having faces and em otions. In conclusion, EO 14179 will be som ewhat of an
im provem ent to elem entary schools, but there needs to be a policy in place that will ensure proper teaching and containm ent of access to
AI in elem entary schools.
