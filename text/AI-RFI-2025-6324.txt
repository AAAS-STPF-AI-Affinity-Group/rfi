General Comment
I don't believe that AI offers any benefit to Am erica or its citizens. 
AI can only exist with m assive IP theft, using the labor of artists, writers, researchers, photographers, film  m akers and m ore all without
their consent or com pensation.
AI takes up m assive am ounts of energy, which increases energy costs for Am ericans, and creates m ore pollution.
AI cannot offer what hum an workers can, stifling innovation and creating worse products at higher costs. No am ount of m oney or IP theft
will m ake the exchange worthwhile to anyone.
AI causes great harm  to Am ericans by creating m assive am ounts of convincing m isinform ation. Am ericans are being bom barded with
algorithm ically fed inform ation each day, which is m ore and m ore disconnected from  truth.
The action plan should be to protect workers from  IP theft, increase regulations on AI, crack down on AI generated m isinform ation and
cease funding for AI.
