General Comment
The so-called "Artificial Intelligence" in question for this "Action Plan" consists of Generative pre-trained transform ers and diffusion-based
m odels. These pointless and stupid technologies were rushed to m arket by packs of unim aginative tech com pany m anagers who were out
of ideas and cam e up with the bright idea: what if we just steal the entire intellectual property of the world, and regurgitate it to custom ers
in a worse form  through an annoying chatbot interface? Since that was apparently not enough, why not do it with the m ost wasteful,
energy-intensive technology possible? Since this idiotic escapade began, the com panies have been hem orrhaging m oney at an alarm ing
rate despite the theft of intellectual property. There has never been a worse and m ore short-sighted business m odel in the history of
hum anity.
As an author and m usician whose intellectual property not only has provided part of a living but has driven econom ic growth in the US, I
join m illions of other artists, m usicians, program m ers, videographers, engineers, and scientists in firm ly opposing all attem pts by com panies
including but not lim ited to Open AI, Meta, Google, Stability, Anthropic, Suno, and Udio, to circum vent copyright restrictions in the nam e
of GPTs, LLMs, TTIMs, and related technologies. Copyright drives econom ic growth: these pointless, wasteful technologies can and will
only inhibit it.
