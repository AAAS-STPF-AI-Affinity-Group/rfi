General Comment
Any com pany worth its m erit does not require the governm ent to rem ove the rule of law as a "barrier" for them  to succeed.
Getting rid of copyright protections when it com es to AI training data is going to hurt the Am erican citizens and their creatives first, and
then it will hurt the corporations later. This is a short sighted solution that will undercut every brilliant m ind in the US, just to serve the
current Tech CEOs who can't thrive without you letting them  steal intellectual property to feed into their inefficiently designed AIs.
If you want to beat China in this race, you should incentivize, subsidize, and com pensate the valuable and creative m inds you have here.
Not allow billionaires to legally steal from  them .
