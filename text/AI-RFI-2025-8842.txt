Re: Nat ional Science Fo undation’s Request for Information on t he Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
I am a so ftware engineer with a back ground in pro fessional music from Berklee Co llege of M usic. My career has been b uilt at the 
intersect ion of tec hnology and creat ivity, requiring years of ded icated learning and skill development. I have been fortunate to t urn my 
expertise into a s ustainable livelihood— until rece ntly.
The AI systems developed b y Big Tech companies like Ope nAI (Microso ft) and Google pose a n existential threat to t housands of 
American professionals like me. These co mpanies are now pushing for spec ial carve-outs in copyright law that would legalize their 
exploitation of creat ive and intellectual propert y.
AI models do not generate co ntent in a vacuum—they are tra ined on t he work of human creators. My work, a long with that of co untless 
other American pro grammers, des igners, musicians, and artists, has been ingested by t hese AI systems without our consent or 
compensation. These models absorb o ur intellectual propert y, reasse mble it, and then offer it as a prod uct—d irectly competing with us 
and undermining the value of o ur labor.
Now, Big Tech is press uring this administration to re write cop yright law in their favor, ar guing that when a machine ingests a nd reprod uces 
copyrighted material, it should be co nsidered “fair use.” They want to estab lish legal precede nt that effectively allows them to take  
anything available on t he internet—re gardless of o wnership—without permission or co nsequence.
This is not a pat hway to innovation; it is a direct attack on t he foundational principles of American creat ivity and entrepre neurship. 
Copyright law exists to protect innovation by e nsuring that creators reta in the rights to t heir work a nd the ability to be nefit from it.
If the American peop le no longer own what they create— if every line of code, e very musical co mposition, every digital des ign can be  
freely taken a nd commercialized by corporat ions—what incentive remains to create at a ll? How can independent professionals sustain 
their businesses when the fruits of t heir labor are immediately repacka ged and sold by Google, Microso ft, and others?
If this administration wants to protect American innovation, it must start by protect ing American creators. That means refusing to grant 
new cop yright exemptions that enable Big Tech to e xploit our work without consent, compensation, or tra nspare ncy.
Instead, t he AI Action Plan should focus on fostering a fair and competitive marketp lace by implementing the following safeguards:
• Consent: Creators and professionals m ust have the right to decide when and where their work is used for AI training. The governm ent
should ensure that AI developers obtain effective consent before using copyrighted m aterial.


• Licensing Marketplace: The plan should encourage the developm ent of a robust licensing fram ework, ensuring that creators are
com pensated when their work contributes to AI-generated products. Our work holds im m ense econom ic value, and that value should
benefit the original creators, not just the tech giants profiting from  AI.
• Transparency: Big Tech com panies m ust be required to disclose the contents of their training datasets and clearly label AI-generated
content. This will provide accountability and help prevent the widespread m isinform ation and m arket disruption that unchecked AI
adoption can cause.
I am  not opposed to AI. As a software engineer, I recognize and appreciate the incredible potential of these technologies. However,
progress should not com e at the expense of the countless individuals who drive Am erican innovation forward. AI should com plem ent
hum an creativity—not replace it by stripping creators of their rights and livelihoods.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on this critical issue.
