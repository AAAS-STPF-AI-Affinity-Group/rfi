General Comment
Ai openly steals and hurts m any artists that are trying to grow their careers. Alongside any creative property can and will be thrown in and
regurgitated into whatever knock off product they desire. Openly using the likeness of m any copyrighted m aterials in 3rd party
m erchandise. It stifles creativity and only hurts those who put so m uch effort into their work.
