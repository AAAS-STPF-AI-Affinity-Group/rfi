General Comment
I do not believe that generative AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of
theft. AI is already proven to be offputting to the public and does not work when m arketed. It is m isleading Am ericans and it is
cheapening our im age in the eyes of other nations.
