See https://newsletter.martingeddes.com/p/can- ai-be-programmed- to-become-godly By Martin 
Geddes Also see https://github.com/lltfm/openness By G. Damien Lance AI is not an isolated 
issue. It's one component in a rapid journey toward globally transforming humans into remotely-
controllable machine-things. Should leaders in law and public policy accept whatever's possible 
simply because it's possible? Maybe that question can be a guideline for the unprecedented 
challenges technology presents for humanity. What the technologists frankly tell us they're doing 
is: REPLACING HUMANS. Eventually. People like you. They tell us they'll be done with this 
project by 2050. The project-leaders and  lab-workers and  lab-funders and industry cheerleaders 
themselves say this. Names for, or components of, the complex that AI is just one part of 
include: biodigital convergence , The Great Reset, Agenda 2030, The Singularity, 
transhumanism, bio-robotics, posthumanism, cyborgization, neurotechnology, synthetic biology, 
augmented Reality (AR), cybernetics, nanotechnology, digital twin. It isn't science fiction. 
They're working on replacing your progeny with artificial creatures. Your children, and your 
descendants. Your body. Your thoughts. Your soul. Your food. And your pets. And farm 
animals. And their food. And all living things. People have already invented technologies for 
turning people like you into a molecular biological machine. They're now implementing those 
technologies. Now. They tell us the technology they're making is intended to turn people like you 
and your kids into machines. They tell us they can or will be able to attach you and them to a 
wireless network that is now in early stages of functioning as a worldwide molecular biological 
machine. Inventors who work in labs somewhere themselves say they're working on expanding- -
-one individual at a time ---this self-powered, self-replicating living biological network of 
individual transhumans... until the human species is replaced by the inventors' artificial trans-
human, trans-species products. And until the course of evolution is permanently altered.  
According to these lab-worker teams, no one is even debating the fact that these technologies ar e 
CURRENTLY being used to try to get YOU -- body and soul -- irreversibly blended into "the 
internet of things." Things. You-plugged-in. As a thing. Whether you want to be or not. You can 
easily find thousands of fact-sources like patents, speeches, public presentations, and published 
reports in peer-reviewe d journals. Many hundreds of references to hundreds of direct sources tell 
us what scientists, technologists, and manufacturers themselves say about their artifice. They  
openly, publicly tell anyone who will listen what the technology is and can do so far, what its 
components are, how the components function, how they function together, how the parts of a 
transformed r emotely-controllable f ormer-human transceiver -biorobot parallel computer 
architecture most of us are familiar with, and how they're working on extending this technology 
much, much further . It's what they themselves say about what they're now doing. Infusing folks 
like you and me with nano-size material s o bio-robots that result can be remotely operated. Other  
ingredients and components of the system include graphene and reduced graphene oxide, 
luminescent  Luciferase from sea-life and insects, hydrogel, wireless- radio tech---aka 5G/nextG 
mobile-phone signal---and other things that are essential to the  whole bio-machine's  successful 
operation. This technology is real. It's here. Via reduced gra phene oxide, it's being quietly 
integrated into EVERYONE'S bodies. Now. Did you know this? Did you consent? You have no 
choice about being transformed into a machine if you don't even know it's being done to you. 
What matters most? Your own life and soul? Your kids' lives and souls? Their kids' lives and 
souls? Human life. All living things. The course of evolution. Permanent protection of living


things in their original state. Protection of products of incomprehensible origins. From eternity 
and for eternity. OR... Permanent replacement of human beings with an artificial species. Permanent damage of living things by the stuff that inspires science- fiction fantasies, and that 
thrills mere unrestrained, unsupervised, imperfect, limited mortals having fun in the playgrounds of their private earthly laboratories. Now that so many of us know these facts, not-knowing about what's going on and what's at stake is no longer an excuse for failing to confront it -- with law and policy, economics, technology, and whatever it takes to protect our children and the future from man -made hell on earth.

alongside passenger aircraft in commercial airspace …critical for the use of hypersonic weapons ,[ie]missilesthatfly faster

position and make better decision s. …Secret services and special forces are expected to benefit greatly from 5G. … It will
increase the lethality of killer drones and war robots by allowing them to recognize, track, and target people based on
facial recognition and other characteristics. As a high -tech arm, the 5Gnetwork is also expected to be a target for cyber -

Who Owns the 5G Cellular Towers in the United States?
https://dgtlinfra.com/who -owns-the-5g-cellular-towers(Also see ee.co.uk/our -company)
https://AmericanTower.com NYSE, ticker AMT. 40.6k US towers; 179k global.
https://SBASite.com NASDAQ, ticker SBAC. 16.5k US towers; 32.7k global.
https://CrownCastle.com NYSE, ticker CCI. 40.1k US towers; 0 global.
Without local oversight, companies like thes e find and privately buy or rent small squares of land on which to build a tower. Data -transmission equipment is
stacked on different levels at the tops of the towers. Each level is rented out to carriers like T -Mobile and Verizon. The higher the level, th e higher the rent.

To rush, somebody who was paid tax -money via the U.S. “Federal Communications Commission” invented the OTARD Rule.
It claimsit “prohibits restrictions that impair a person's ability to install, maintain, or use an antenna covered by the rule.”
