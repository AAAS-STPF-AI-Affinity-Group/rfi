1. Precisely Define the use-cases for using AI in: Government, Civilian life and
Armed forces (on the battlefield  etc.).
2. Develop AI and let it flourish for those precisely defined use-cases only. Safe-guardagainst scope-creep for all those defined use-cases.
3. Ask the question, whether we (USA or human
 civilization) need to solve for AGI?
It is likely that we may not.
1. If we wisely decide to NOT solve for AGI (collectively, as USA or human race),
then develop precise safeguarding mechanisms to make sure that AGI is notdeveloped on this planet (Earth). Hopefully, we will do a better job at this than thenuclear non-proliferation
 treaty/treaties.
2. If we do decide to solve for AGI (for any reason) then, go big and go fast, with
multiple fail-safe mechanisms built-in.
