General Comment
Artificial Intelligence (AI) isn’t a foolproof tool. There are num ber of extrem ely pressing concerns — concerns with data security, with
inform ation that’s entirely invalid/inaccurate, and with inform ation that violates copyright laws. 
Each of these factors can (and will) have a significant negative im pact on research, intelligence, and national and international security.
