General Comment
Allowing tech com panies to hide behind "fair use" in training on copyrighted works without perm ission or com pensation is both a tragedy
for art and culture in Am erica, as well as a com plete m isunderstanding of how Generative AI works. LLMs and Diffusion Models
CANNOT create unique new works of art, they can only regurgitate and plaigerize. As the world is flooded with m ore AI generated
content the value of all hum an-m ade content will approach zero, which m eans an end to art and creative writing as a way to m ake a living,
and a m uch m ore boring and depressing world. Please don't allow inhum ane tech com panies to destroy our cultural past, present and
future.
