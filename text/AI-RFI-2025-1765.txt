General Comment
Letting AI use the intellectual property of artists against their will devalues hum an thought, ingenuity, creative thinking, and am bition. It
prom otes toxic consum erist lifestyles in society by trying to m inim ize hum an’s original thought by substituting it with easy-access over
saturated content. And it further disconnects an already disjointed people, by leaving no artist to adm ire or aspire toward behind the
artwork. 
Do not give generative AI m ore legal power! It is actively threading society’s quality of life!
