General Comment
Any “unham pered” and “unim peded” developm ent of “AI” is nothing m ore than indiscrim inate theft of hum an work. “Garbage in =
garbage out.” “You get what you pay for.” “AI” developed indiscrim inately will be actively harm ful to the overwhelm ing m ajority of
hum ans while unjustly enriching a select few. To truly m ake the United States of Am erica great the governm ent should work to nourish
and support hum an artists and innovators and treat “AI” as just another tool—useful, but dangerous if applied incorrectly. “AI” developed
from  hum an work that was not adequately paid for is theft and should be treated (and prosecuted) as such.
