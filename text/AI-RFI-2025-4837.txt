General Comment
That video of trum p sucking elon's toes? yeah that will happen ALOT m ore if this m easure is to go through. This action plan would allow
AI com panies to steal and use other people's work without perm ission. This will not m ake us the "Leader" of AI. Nobody wants AI
anym ore because it has peaked in what it can be useful for. The only thing this m easure will do will allow m ore deepfakes, create even
m ore chaotic news to happen to gullible people and m ake very unethical practices the norm .
