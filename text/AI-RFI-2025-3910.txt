NO NO NO
Generative AI is theft of other people's goods. 
Either AI com panies m ust pay fair prices for the goods they analyze and add to their databases -- these goods containing work by living
artists, scientists, writers, and analysts -- or they m ust be banned from  using all copyrighted content. 
AI as it is going now, is wasteful, and produces slop. 
You already spent billions on it, only to be com pletely outdone by Deepseek, a little AI from  China that consum es far less power and
potable water while turning out results every bit as "useful" as those produced by the big AI com panies in the US.
IF you insists on going forward with this, there m ust be strict laws about what can and cannot be used for AI training without paym ent,
and AI output MUST NOT be allowed to be copyrighted. Furtherm ore, AI m ust not be used as a pretense for firing hum an em ployees,
when the end results always seem  to involve either those few people left spending overtim e having to clean up the AI output that was
supposed to replace their form er co-workers, or an end-product that is error-ridden SLOP. 
You want to end waste and fraud? GENERATIVE AI IS A PERFECT PLACE TO FOCUS.
