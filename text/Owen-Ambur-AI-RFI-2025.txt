[External] AI Action Plan
Tuesday, February 25, 2025 10:10:43 PM
Consistent with the good practice set forth in the OPEN Government Data Act , which 
President Trump signed into law six years ago, as well as section 10  of the GPRA 
Modernization Act more explicitly, the AI action plan should be published in open,  
standard, machine-readable format, like Strategy Markup Language (StratML, ISO  
17469-1 and formerly ANSI/AIIM 22:2017).
Likewise, the developers of AI systems potentially affecting members of the public  
should be expected, if not required, to publish in such format the performance plans  
and reports for their applications.
Doing so will enable other AI systems to help stakeholders and organizations  
representing their interests become aware of those impacts and respond  
appropriately in support of their own interests, without imposing undue regulatory  
burdens on anyone.
Disclaimer:  This document is approved for public dissemination. It contains no  
business-proprietary or confidential information. It contents may be reused by the  
government in developing the AI Action Plan and associated documents without  
attribution.
Likewise, the schemas for StratML Part 1, Strategic Plans, and Part 2, Performance  
Plans & Reports, are freely available for public use:
https://stratml.us/references/StrategicPlanISOVersion20140401.xsd  
https://stratml.us/references/PerformancePlanOrReport20160216.xsd
It would be good if the schema for StratML Part 2 were used to enable semi-
automated ingestion of agency performance reports into the Performance.gov site,  
including reports explicitly addressing their usages of AI systems.
