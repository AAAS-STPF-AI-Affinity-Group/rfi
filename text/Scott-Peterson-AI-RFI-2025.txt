Regarding the AI investment of $500B... Why are we giving the elite billionaires contracts to make AI 
that China made for a few million. Sounds like a handout to me. Billions have already been spent 
and we made an inferior product. Throwing money at this a nd to Trump's buddies isn't the solution. 
When the Chinese company that made Deepseek and were interviewed they were asked how they 
did it so quickly and efficiently. I know you all know the answer they gave. They said it was because 
of the work environmen t they built it in. I'd say the solution is to pay and treat workers better but 
that wont change, that takes money out of the elite's pockets... And now your essentially donating 
money to them for the same thing you gve them money for before and..... We ha d ChatGPT. That 
was great for a while, until we learned that we were far behind. You deny we are far behind to keep 
people believing this is the best country. China showed you wrong. You know their practices and 
how it was done but we are choosing to give money away for a slightly improved product that takes 
2 years and by then we are WAY behind China. If you want to stay ahead of China you need more 
that throwing money at the wealthy and elite. You are wasting our money on a solution that we don't 
have yet. It's sad to see what's all being taken care of and taken away. More money out of our 
pockets and more into theirs. Trickle up economics, works almost every time. Nothing that has 
been done has been America First. It's Billionaire first. Now we're looking  at passing a budget bill 
that takes away more from the average American and trickle it up while prices rise and people can't 
eat. Get the food and price regulations under control rather than this AI you think we should be 
working on.
