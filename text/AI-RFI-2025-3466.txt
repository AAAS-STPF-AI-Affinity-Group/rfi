General Comment
Moving forward with AI will com pletely ruin the profitability and protections of creatives and creative works. I urge those in power to not
bow down to Google and OpenAI. Not only will this irreparabley dam age creative works, it will continue to generate false inform ation
and slop, m aking the internet at m inim um  unusable. Artists deserve to have their works protected and not regurgitated for a cheap buck.
Allowing generative ai to train on copyrighted works, it will cause a ripple effect into every aspect of our lives for the worse. Anything
from  diagram s in m edical textbooks to dangerous advice would m ake things incredibly unsafe.
