General Comment
As a writer, I am  horrified at the rise of "generative AI" and fear for the future of this country if every citizen is sacrificed and fed into the
regurgitation m achine that spits out a false, flat pseudoreality. AI will be the death of Intellectual Property in every way, and will harm
anyone who has ever created anything m ore involved than a grocery shopping list or m indless doodles.
AI does not "learn" from  the texts and im ages it's fed, it just shuffles it all around and predicts what the likely next word or pixel in the
series should be. For anyone who values copyright, or who benefits from  owning intellectual property of any kind, will lose if m uch stricter
barriers are not erected around the so-called "artificial intelligence" system s.
