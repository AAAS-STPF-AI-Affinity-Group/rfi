General Comment
I hope this passes! I can't wait for less restrictions on AI so I can generate all sorts of fun im ages of elon m usk and Trum p in
com prom ising and em barrassing situations. All this caution and regulation on it prevents that and its a real sham e. I can't wait until it is
developed you can't tell whats real or not anym ore and that includes things like Trum p streaking across the whitehouse lawn or Musk
stealing top secret docum ents to fuel his ketam ine habit.
