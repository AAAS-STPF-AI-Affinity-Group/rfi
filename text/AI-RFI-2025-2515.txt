General Comment
Having any of this ai com panies only able to use item s in the public dom ain is better than having the able to access pretty m uch the entirety
of the internet. I don’t think this proposal was ever a good idea. Ai anything is a bad idea and always has been. Please reconsider enacting
this and don’t enact such a thing. Google only wants access because they are a big com pany that sells inform ation to others.
