General Comment
I believe Generative AI will NOT because it will steal art works from  creatives, which they have a RIGHT to their own work and that it
shouldnâ€™t be STOLEN. AI will also steal jobs from  creatives, increasing hom elessness and hurting the econom y due to lack of people
having m oney to spend.
