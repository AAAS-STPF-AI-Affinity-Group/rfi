Eclipse Submission  in Response to Request for Information on 
Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  
Since the launch of ChatGPT, the demand for AI applications has surged, 
generating unprecedented increased demand for robust computational 
infrastructure. Existing facilities, technologies, and capabilities to manufacture and 
assemble the necessary technol ogies are insufficient to handle the processing 
requirements of training and interference workloads.  
As a true general -purpose technology (GPT), AI is pervasive across key  sectors of 
the economy, improving rapidly, and spawning complementary innovations. 
Arguably, more than any previous technology paradigm shift, AI is quickly 
transforming industries, economies, and societies worldwide. Winners in the race to 
develop and deploy leading AI technologies will safeguard their own national 
interests, whil e also cementing their leadership in the global AI competition . AI is 


2 
rapidly reshaping industries and global power structures. Countries that control AI 
production and deployment will dictate  economic and military advancements in the 
coming decades.  
As AI becomes a critical driver of economic and military power, it is imperative for 
the United States to lead, including by ensuring that our  allies develop secure, high -
performance AI infrastructure  consistent with U.S. AI technology standards and 
architecture . Given the increasing influence of Chinese AI technology , and the 
attendant risks of widespread international deployment of Chin a based AI 
infrastructure built on key advances such as DeepSeek, U.S. companies —backed by 
the U.S. government —must establish a robust, repeatable framework for deploying 
AI infrastructure  both domestically and internationally . This submission outlines a 
strategi c approach to drive U.S. AI leadership through three key initiatives :  
1.Domestic Production of Key Data Center Components
2.Adoption of U.S.-led AI capabilities by Key Allies
3.Strategic Energy Deployment for American AI Infrastructure
1.Domestic Production of Key Data Center Components
Building a Comprehensive Data Center Manufacturing Supply Chain in the United 
States  
Strategic Objectives  
As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly vital for economic growth, 
national security, and technological leadership, it is imperative that the United 
States develop a comprehensive, domestically  based manufacturing supply chain for 
key data center components. This strategic initiative focuses on ensuring that 
critical hardware —ranging from servers, graphics processing units ( GPUs ), and 
storage systems to networking and power infrastructure —is produced within the 
country to support the ever -growing demand for AI -driven computing.  Additional 
policy actions may be required to ensure that  manufacturing of key components 


 
3 
 
occurs domestically. This could include actions under the authority of President 
Trump’s “Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services 
Supply Chain” Executive Order1, new Executive Order s, or related legislation.  
Servers  
Domestic production of AI -optimized servers requires a robust supply chain for 
critical components such as motherboards, central processing units (CPUs), and 
high-bandwidth memory. The government should focus on fostering partnerships 
between hardware manufacturers, research institutions, and government agencies 
to support local fabrication plants and ensure a stable supply of raw materials like 
rare earth elements.  
GPUs and AI Accelerators  
GPUs and AI accelerators are among the most critical components for AI -driven 
data centers , yet m uch of the manufacturing is still outsourced to foreign foundries. 
To enhance domestic capabilities, the U.S. must expand its investment in advanced 
semiconductor fabrication facilities capable of producing cutting -edge AI chips at 
scale. This requires state -level incentives for companies to establish new fabs, 
workforce development programs to train engineers and technicians, and 
strengthened research and development (R&D) efforts to push the boundaries of 
chip design and manufacturing processes , as well as trade measures to protect 
against non -competitive and non -market practices  by foreign nation competitors . 
For advanced AI chips, the U.S. must streamline the process of export control 
review and ensure that appropriate export control provisions do not limit the ability 
of American companies to compete in inter national markets and risk losing key 
customers to Chinese or other foreign competitors.  
Storage Systems

10538/securing -the-information -and -communications -technology -and -services -supply -chain   


4 
High -performance storage solutions, such as solid -state drives (SSDs) and high -
capacity storage arrays, are essential for managing the vast amounts of data 
processed by AI applications. While the U.S. has strong storage technology 
companies, much of the co mponent manufacturing occurs overseas. Increasing 
domestic production would require investment in advanced fabrication facilities for 
NAND flash memory and storage controllers, as well as partnerships with major 
storage solution providers to onshore final assembly and testing.  
Networking and Power Infrastructure  
Beyond computational components, networking hardware —such as high -speed 
switches, routers, and fiber -optic connectivity solutions —must be produced 
domestically to support AI workloads securely and efficiently. Additionally, power 
and cooling infrastructure  for AI data centers require specialized hardware, 
including power distribution units (PDUs) and liquid cooling systems. Government 
policies such as  streamlined permitting processes can encourage domestic 
production of these critical infrastructure element s. 
Policy and Investment Strategies  
To achieve full domestic production of AI data center components, a combination of 
government policy support, private sector investment, and workforce training 
initiatives is necessary. Potential strategies include:  
•Tax incentives for companies investing in U.S. -based semiconductor and
hardware manufacturing facilities.
•Stream -lined regulatory approvals, especially for environmental permitting,
for domestic investment in these areas.
•Public -private partnerships to support AI infrastructure and supply chain
resilience.
•Education and workforce development programs to build a skilled labor force
for semiconductor and high -performance computing industries.


 
5 
 
• Trade policies that reduce dependency on foreign supply chains while 
ensuring access to essential raw materials.  
By addressing these requirements, the United States can enhance its 
competitiveness in AI -driven computing while ensuring long -term security and 
technological independence in production of critical infrastructure components.  
 
2. Adoption of U.S. -led AI capabilities by Key Allies  
Establishing a  Repeatable Deployment Model for S calable and Adaptable AI 
Infrastructure across Allied Nations   
Strategic Objectives  
By ensuring that allied nations have access to secure AI infrastructure, the U.S. can 
both safeguard its own interests and promote a future where AI development aligns 
with democratic values and fair competition.  
The primary objective of this initiative is to enhance AI sovereignty for U.S. allies 
by providing secure, high -quality AI infrastructure that aligns with U.S. 
technological and security standards. By expanding economic and technological 
influence, the U.S . will enable allied nations to develop competitive AI ecosystems 
without reliance on technology  from adversary nations . Establishing a repeatable 
deployment model will create a scalable and adaptable AI infrastructure framework 
that can be replicated across multiple allied nations. Additionally, this strategy will 
strengthen U.S. industry leadership, positioning American technology firms as the 
preferred providers of AI solutions in global markets. A well -structured AI 
infrastructure strategy not only benefits U.S. allies but also so lidifies America's role 
as a leader in technological advancement. By expanding economic impac t and 
securing partnerships in AI development, the U.S. can prevent strategic 
vulnerabilities in global AI supply chains. The goal is to create a n ecosystem where 
allied nations u tilize  reliable, secure, and cutting -edge AI technologies. It is 
essential that leading American companies —in alignment with U.S. government 


6 
policy —seize the initiative and offer allied countries a viable solution for AI 
infrastructure. Unlike the 5G competition, in which the U.S. struggled to offer allied 
countries a cost-effective alternative to Huawei  products , U.S. companies are world 
leaders in AI infrastructure and can deliver a repeatable, scalable capability suite to 
allied countries to build a global network of U.S. -developed AI infrastructure.  And 
unlike the 5G competition, in which the U.S. was forced to fight an uphill battle to 
conv ince allies to rip out Huawei equipment, the U.S. currently has the opportunity 
to take the lead in providing allies with a viable AI solution. Furthermore, the 
stakes are higher —unlike 5G telecom equipment, or reliance on a natural resource 
like oil —once a country has adopted AI infrastructure that is built on adversary 
architecture, it will be almost impossible to liberate the minds and social systems 
that have become reliant on these systems.  
Key Components of AI Infrastructure Development  
Data centers form the backbone of AI infrastructure, offering computational power 
for training and deploying AI models. These facilities must be designed to meet high 
security and operational efficiency standards, ensuring protection against cyber 
threats.  By building partnerships with allied governments and private entities, the 
U.S. can create an ecosystem where AI computing power remains within friendly 
nations rather than being outsourced to adversar y-nation  entities.  
AI development and deployment are incredibly energy -intensive, making a resilient 
energy grid crucial for AI infrastructure. Baseload energy sources such as natural 
gas and nuclear power generation will be essential to meeting the growing demand 
for reliable, uninterrupted energy. Partnering with U.S. energy firms will provide 
the necessary technical expertise to develop robust energy systems  capable of 
supporting AI infrastructure at scale.  
Semiconductors are a cornerstone of AI technology, and control over the supply 
chain ensures both economic stability and security. By developing advanced 
manufacturing hubs within allied nations, the U.S. can mitigate risks associated 
with vulnerable supply chains . Investments in fabrication plants and advanced 


 
7 
 
semiconductor research will also boost technological innovation within allied 
territories.  
Building full -stack, advanced manufacturing capabilities  in-country , including 
autonomous solutions that integrate software and robotics, will lead to increased 
self-sufficiency in manufacturing, reducing the need for allied countries to rely 
indefinitely on products manufactured across a broad range of external partners. By 
leveraging AI -driven automation, additive manufacturing, and intelligent supply 
chain solutions, the U.S. and its allies can create a resilient and efficient industrial 
base. Furthermor e, digital manufacturing environments provide robust traceability 
that helps to improve quality and efficiency by giving manufacturers real -time 
visibility into their operations and facilitating root -cause analysis. This is of 
particular importance for AI infrastructure as semiconductor delays stemming from 
a flawed production process can lead to critical project delays, slower AI 
development, and the potential for competitive disadvantage.   
Robotics and automation will significantly affect a variety of  industries  ranging  
from manufacturing to healthcare. Deploying AI -powered robotics can increase 
efficiency and mak e allied economies more competitive. Developing AI -driven 
robotics solutions for industries such as logistics, healthcare, and defense will 
promot e U.S. robotics firms as preferred partners in industrial automation.  
The UAE as a Pilot Nation  
The UAE is an ideal starting point for this initiative due to its strategic geopolitical 
status , strong existing ties with the U.S. in defense, technology, and energy, 
significant investment in AI and digital transformation initiatives, and commitment 
to economic diversification and advanced technology adoption. As a nation 
committed to innovation, the UAE presents an excellent opportunity to establish a 
model for AI infrastructure development. With a government that actively promotes 
technological progress , including through the UAE National Strategy for Artificial 
Intelligence 2031, there is great opportunity for collaboration with U.S. companies. 


8 
A successful implementation in the UAE can serve as a blueprint for future 
expansions in other allied nations.  
Implementation Strategy  
Private -sector companies can build on President Trump's recent Executive Order, 
"Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence" , to create a 
structured playbook for implementing AI infrastructure in allied countries.2 This 
Executive Order provides a foundation for reducing regulatory burdens, 
streamlining AI development, and fostering private investment in AI technologies. 
U.S. technology firms can leverage this framework to deploy AI infrastructure 
efficiently while maintaining high s ecurity and ethical standards.  
A comprehensive framework  should outline best practices for designing, 
constructing, and maintaining AI infrastructure, ensuring consistency and 
scalability across allied nations. This includes establishing guidelines for securing 
government approvals, developing partnerships with  local stakeholders, and 
integrating AI solutions that align with U.S. technological and national security 
interests. By codifying these procedures, U.S. companies can replicate successful AI 
deployment models in multiple regions, reinforcing strategic alliances and 
expanding economic influence.  
Investment in AI infrastructure requires substantial financial backing.  In addition 
to funding from deep and liquid U.S. capital markets, g overnment -supported 
financing options from participating countries, including grants and tax incentives, 
will ensure the long -term sustainability of AI infrastructure projects across allied 
nations. Utilizing U.S. government -backed financing options such a s the U.S. 
International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the Export -Import 
Bank of the United States for U. S. firms investing in allied AI infrastructure will 
help support  these efforts.  
2 Executive Order 14179 (January 23, 2025 ), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/31/2025 -
02172/removing -barriers -to-american -leadership -in-artificial -intelligence   


 
9 
 
A skilled workforce is vital to sustaining AI innovation. Training local talent 
ensures that allied nations can maintain and expand AI infrastructure. Academic 
partnerships, internships, and startup incubators can help create a thriving AI 
ecosystem. Establishing AI research partnerships with local universities and 
institutions, launching training programs to develop local AI talent, and fostering 
an innovation ecosystem that supports startups and technology incubators w ill be 
key components welcomed by all ied nations to support domestic AI industry growth . 
 
3. Strategic Energy Deployment for American AI Infrastructure  
Fast-Tracked Energy Transportation and Power Generation Supporting American 
Technology and Manufacturing Sectors  
Strategic Objectives  
This initiative focuses on establish ing a robust, efficient, and resilient energy 
infrastructure to underpin the expansive build -out of AI systems across the United 
States. By streamlining federal –state regulatory coordination  and standardizing 
permitting processes, the approach aims to facilitate  rapid deployment of power 
generation and energy transportation projects. These measures not only provide the 
reliable, high -capacity energy required by data centers and AI applications but also 
promote domestic semiconductor production, regional revita lization, and the 
integration of advanced nuclear and energy storage solutions. Ultimately, this 
integrated approach drives innovation, enhances grid stability, and fortifies the 
nation’s competitive position in the global technology landscape, ensuring th at 
critical AI infrastructure is supported by a resilient and reliable energy system.  
Federal -State Regulatory Coordination  
Coordinating energy infrastructure across multiple states is a complex challenge 
that often shifts costs and impacts retail customers nationwide. To address these 
issues, it is essential to enhance federal –state regulatory coordination by 
establishing a si ngle point of contact for all parties involved in generation permits 


10 
and interconnection requests. A dedicated coordinating body should be formed with 
oversight authority to engage with both federal and state agencies, ensuring that 
priority projects can progress more efficiently. In this system, projects that meet 
rigorous  criteria —such as demonstrating 80 percent deliverability during peak net 
load hours while proving commercial viability —could be prioritized for expedited 
review.  
Standardized Load Interconnection Processes  
Developing a standardized load interconnection process is a pivotal step in 
improving the pace of new generation additions . This process would rely on a 
simplified evaluation of the existing grid conditions, allowing for provisional 
interconnection approvals for fast -track projects until all other permits are 
finalized. To further ensure efficiency and fairness, utilities should adhere to a 
strict timeline —such as a 30 -day deadline for finalizing interconnection timing and  
cost—thereby prioritizing projects that are both viable and ready for integration.  
Long -Term Contractual Financial Support for U.S. Industrial Capacity  
Public and private financial  support for industrial capacity is a key requirement for 
developing modern energy infrastructure. Core infrastructure assets such as 
pipelines and transmission networks face deployment constraints that must be 
addressed by securing anchor tenants for large interregional projects and 
modernizing existing infrastructure. This modernization is particularly important 
currently for accommodating rapid deployment of natural gas -fired power plants 
and renewable energy sources. Public s ector financial support as a driver of  
development of AI infrastructure also leads to local economic growth and job  
creation —especially in rural areas —by establishing technology and infrastructure 
hubs that require a mix of skilled and unskilled labor.   
Texas  as a Case Study  
Texas provides a unique case study for energy infrastructure development. The 
ERCOT system does not participate in interstate commerce, allowing it to bypass 


11 
federal approval processes and streamline project execution. The state also benefits 
from abundant natural gas supplies and innovative demand response programs that 
enable large consumers to adjust power usage during peak periods. Despite these 
advantages,  challenges in resource adequacy —as exemplified by events like Winter 
Storm Uri —have prompted some companies to explore off -grid solutions, 
highlighting the need to balance regional autonomy with broader grid reliability.  
Regional Focus: Rustbelt Revitalization  
The Rustbelt region, which includes parts of the  PJM regional transmission 
organization (RTO) in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, represents a 
significant opportunity for regional revitalization. Existing infrastructure, such as 
high-voltage transmission lines and industrial sites, can be leveraged alongside 
abundant water supplies and favorable cooling conditions. Furthermore, regional 
natural gas abundance provides a strong founda tion for new power generation 
assets , provided that federal permitting  measures are streamlined . The 
reintegration of mothballed baseload  power generation could serve as a temporary 
measure to ensure affordability and reliability until new firm generation capacity, 
including nuclear energy, is licensed and deployed. Developing AI infrastructure 
could spur significant job creation and contribute to local economic growth  for the 
region . 
Addressing Permitting Barriers  
Federal permitting remains one of the principal barriers, with approvals often  
taking five to seven years due to overlapping requirements for air quality permits, 
water quality permits, environmental impact assessments, and other regulatory 
requirements . Streamlining these processes through clear timeframes for filing 
challenges , and expediting environmental reviews could significantly reduce delays 
and enhance project execution.  
Fast Track Permitting for  Behind -the-Meter / Islanding Solutions  


 
12 
 
One alternative to circumvent permitting challenges and generation queue delays is 
adopt ion of  an insular, or “behind -the-meter,” approach for new power generation.  
This strategy involves generating and consuming power on -site without relying on 
the broader power market. Such an approach enhances energy reliability, reduces 
grid dependency, and lowers electricity costs through self -generation and peak 
shaving, particularly for data  centers.  
Water and Cooling Solutions  
Water management is a critical factor for AI infrastructure and power resources . 
Advanced cooling technologies —such as free -air cooling, liquid or immersion 
cooling, or direct -to-chip liquid cooling —can offer cost and efficiency advantages . By 
modifying policies like Section 179D to reward facilities that minimize water 
consumption per megawatt and integrate heat recovery with oil and gas operations, 
further efficiency gains can be achieved. Additionally, a DOE -administered grant 
program co uld spur research  and development in liquid cooling systems.  
Combined Heat and Power (CHP)  
Combined heat and power systems provide an efficient solution by generating on -
site power while repurposing waste heat. With the expiration of key tax incentives 
for CHP systems, such as the IRC Section 48 ITC in 2025, restoring these incentives 
could enha nce grid reliability, reduce dependence on centralized systems, and offer 
a viable dispatchable energy solution for the oil and gas sector.  
Nuclear Energy in AI Infrastructure  
Nuclear energy plays a strategic role in supporting American AI infrastructure by 
providing a powerful, efficient, and reliable source of baseload power. Nuclear 
fission generates electricity with out greenhouse gas emissions, complementing 
renewable energy sources in efforts to reduce the overall carbon footprint. Nuclear 
power is particularly well -suited to the demanding energy needs of large -scale data 
centers and AI applications, offering a stable and scalable power source that 
enhances overall energy se curity.  


13 
Energy Storage Solutions  
Reliable energy storage is vital for balancing supply and demand, especially in grids 
increasingly reliant on intermittent renewable energy re sources. Advances in 
battery technologies, including lithium -ion and sodium -ion batteries, are enhancing 
storage capacity and efficiency, thereby bolstering grid stability  and reliability .  
Federal Land Utilization  
Utilizing federal lands for data and AI infrastructure deployment offers significant 
strategic advantages. Recent Executive Orders have highlighted the potential of 
federal lands to support frontier industries, and effective allocation can reduce 
market uncertainties while minimizing the need for expansive federal intervention. 
This approach can further secure investments in the domestic technology sector.  
Defense Production Act (DPA)  
The Defense Production Act provides broad authorities that could be leveraged to 
establish public –private partnerships aimed at enhancing domestic production 
capacity. Such partnerships could secure investments in critical components and 
resources —such as transformers, steel, copper, and nuclear fuel supplies —
support ing robust supply chains and mitigating rising costs.  
Closing Loopholes to Reduce Frivolous Legal Delays  
To prevent project delays caused by frivolous legal challenges, it is necessary to 
streamline the legal process for energy projects. By defining clear criteria for 
standing, limiting the time allowed for filing lawsuits and appeals, and expediting 
environm ental reviews, project timelines can be significantly shortened. This 
approach ensures that vital energy infrastructure advances without undue 
hindrance from meritless legal challenges . 
Legislative Considerations  
Modernizing the Federal Power Act is essential to meet today’s energy demands. 
Originally enacted in 1920, the Act should be updated to incorporate provisions for 


14 
real-time data, cybersecurity measures, and streamlined permitting processes that 
reflect emerging technologies such as AI -driven predictive maintenance and digital 
twin modeling. Such legislative reforms would support rapid evolution in energy 
infrastruct ure while maintaining high standards for environmental and safety 
protections.  
Government Definitions  
Uniform definitions across government agencies are critical for effectively 
regulating emerging technologies like AI and data centers. Establishing consistent 
standards will prevent ambiguity, foster transparency, and create a level playing 
field that supp orts innovation while addressing challenges related to privacy, 
security, and ethical considerations.  
Conclusion  
The surge in demand for AI applications, exemplified by breakthroughs like 
ChatGPT, has underscored the urgent need for a robust, scalable, and secure energy 
and manufacturing infrastructure to support AI -driven computing. The rapid 
evolution of AI as a tr ansformative general -purpose technology is reshaping 
industries, economies, and global power structures. To maintain technological 
leadership and national security, the United States must not only secure its own AI 
infrastructure but also extend its influe nce to key allies, ensuring they have access 
to high -performance, secure, and reliable AI capabilities.  
A comprehensive strategy to achieve these goals involves three interdependent 
initiatives : the domestic production of key data center components, the adoption of 
U.S.-led AI infrastructure by strategic allies, and the strategic deployment of
advanced energy solutions. By developing a full -spectrum, domestically based 
manufacturing supply chain , the U.S. can ensure that critical components —ranging 
from AI -optimized servers and GPUs to storage systems and networking 
hardware —are produced locally, reducing dependency on foreign supply chains and 


 
15 
 
reinforcing technological independence. This effort is complemented by initiatives to 
bolster domestic semiconductor production and the establishment of resilient, high -
capacity energy systems, including advanced nuclear and energy storage solutions, 
which  are essential to meeting the enormous power demands of modern AI 
applications.
