General Comment
Allowing this to go through would ruin the arts for every single m an wom an and child in this country. So m any professions and livelihoods
would im m ediately be ruined all in the nam e of an idea. An idea that holds no m erit, no efficiency, no prom ise, no love. Vote No on this.
This is trash. Garbage.
