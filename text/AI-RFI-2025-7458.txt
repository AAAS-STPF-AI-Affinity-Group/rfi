General Comment
To allow this elim inates the whole m eaning behind copyright. It legalizes intellectual theft. These artists have throw their whole lives into
creating these works and then to hand them , with no recom pense, to som ething that is built to take these intellectual endeavors and create
new "art" is a travesty. AI serves no public interest. This theft will be used to enrich a few and leave artists flailing in their wake. This
should not pass.
