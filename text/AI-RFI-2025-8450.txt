General Comment
AI is a bubble that is m assively unprofitable. Most end users are not adopting it despite big tech's best efforts to shove it in everything.
Banks and investm ent firm s are leaving. If you hate governm ent waste, you should hate protecting a useless industry that the free m arket is
rejecting. 
Also, why do we want to protect som ething that writes paragraphs that are wrong about everything 40% of the tim e and has no practical
industrial use? Next are we going to spend billions to protect dom estic production of designer unicycles for paraplegics?
