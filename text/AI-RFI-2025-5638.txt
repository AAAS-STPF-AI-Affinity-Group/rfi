General Comment
As a professor, I really hate AI. Students who use this are plagiarizing and failing to think for them selves. It is always apparent in the soul-
less, pointless writing. Please do not norm alize this. I want to live in a world where actual ideas arenâ€™t buried in a pile of thoughtlessness.
Thank you.
