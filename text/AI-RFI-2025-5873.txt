General Comment
I am  Joshua McMichael a working artist out of Pennsylvania. I have history in stage work, rennaissance faires, escape room s, fine art, &
illustration. This proposal seeks to see how to not unduly shackle the private center in regards to AI policy, but this very statem ent
disregards the private sector of arts & artists them selves. Already AI developm ent com panies scrape and use the work of artists and
individuals with no regard to copyright and ownership. This already effects and has effected artists and entertainers across the various art
industries. The studio negotiations with the unions in the writers & actors strike are exam ple enough. Being pushed by large studios to sign
over digital rights of the artists and actors to their own selves and creations they rely on to survive and m ake m oney, that is what was and
is forced upon citizens of the United States. Citizens who m ake up your private sector. So when you consider what is an undue burden on
the private sector consider that. AI research that helps us get better at program m ing, identifying m edical problem s, support that. The AI
that m akes up a speculative m arket of im itating others work, do not support that. That is an undue burden. I perm it this statem ent for
public use and display as required to subm it this statem ent.
