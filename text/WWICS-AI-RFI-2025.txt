Re: Input for AI Action Plan  – A Strategic Vision for US AI Leadership: Supporting  Security, 
Innovation, Democracy and Global Prosperity  
Introduction  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more than a technological breakthrough —it is a transformative 
force shaping the future economy, security landscape, global power dynamics, and daily life. 
The US, along with its international allies and private sector leaders, must navigate a pivotal 
moment where their  choices will determine whether AI advances democracy and human 
progress or fuels authoritarianism and societal instability. To ensure AI remains a force for 
good, a comprehensive strategy must prioritize:  
1.Keeping AI and AI -enabled technologies under human control.
2.Securing US AI leadership and economic competitiveness.
3.Retaining collaborative government oversight of AI Industry .
4.Addressing societal risks posed by AI while strengthening democratic institutions.
5.Expanding the benefits of AI globally.
These challenges require decisive action to prevent AI from being exploited for dominance and 
control. With strategic leadership, the US and its allies can harness AI to uphold democracy, 
drive economic growth, and promote global stability.  
1.Keeping  AI and AI -Enabled Technologies Under Human Control
The rapid evolution of AI, particularly the potential emergence of Artificial General Intelligence 
(AGI), presents both opportunities and challenges that require strategic, proactive oversight to 
ensure AI systems remain aligned with human preferences ,1 dignity ,2 security, and economic 
growth. While the possibility and timeline for AGI remain widely debated, the need for AI 
systems to operate under responsible human oversight is clear. Rather than imposing excessive 
regulatory constraints,  the responsible development of AI requires a collaborative approach

2 among policymakers, industry leaders, and global partners to ensure human oversight, ethical 
use, and continued innovation.  
Moreover, the principles of responsible AI oversight must also be extended to AI -enabled 
technologies such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and other scientific advancements that 
can be leveraged for economic competitiveness, while ensuring safeguards aga inst misuse. Just 
as collaborative AI governance is essential to advancing US leadership and security, parallel 
safeguards must support the responsible integration of AI across other technology sectors.  
In addition to maintaining “human -over -the-loop ” (where humans provide necessary input or 
oversight), especially with national security and research AI models, it is important to keep a 
“human -in-the-loop” for high -risk AI applications, where direct human decision -making is 
essential to prevent unintend ed harm (e.g., autonomous weapons, medical AI) and “human -on-
the-loop” where AI can be allowed to operate mostly autonomously, but humans must be able 
to intervene when necessary (e.g., self -driving cars, AI -assisted financial systems). Advances in 
"Human -guided AI" where AI can function with minimal supervision in low -risk environments 
can maximize efficiency and productivity.  
Action Steps to Ensure Human Control Over AI and AI -Enabled Technologies  
1.Strengthen the Role of the US AI Safety Institute (AISI)  – The AISI,3 a unit of US
Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST)  should
be the  lead entity  in conducting independent risk assessments to evaluate  high -risk
AI models . It should work closely with private industry ,4 ensuring that AI safety
efforts align with  human control,  economic growth and national security
imperatives.
2.Ensure Mandatory Shutdown Mechanisms  – AI systems must be designed with  fail-
safe mechanisms  that allow immediate deactivation if they deviate from intended
functions or pose security risks. This is particularly critical for  autonomous weapons,
financial trading AI, AI -powered infrastructure  control, and medical AI diagnostics.
3.Government Authority to Temporarily Suspend Unsafe AI Systems  – While
industry -led safeguards are crucial, the government must retain authority to
temporarily suspend AI systems that pose serious safety or security risks, like
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration vehicle recalls. This last -resort
measure ensu res public safety when industry mechanisms fail. This temporary
suspension mechanism  would require  necessary corrections  before AI systems can
be redeployed in high -risk environments.
4.Define Global AI Safety Standards  – The US should  leverage its AI leadership to
shape global AI safety frameworks  rather than adopting overly restrictive
compliance models. Through initiatives like the  Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute

3 Consortium ( AISIC )5 and the International Network of AI Safety Institutes 
(INASI ),6 the US can  engage allied nations, researchers, and industry leaders to 
establish voluntary, adaptable AI safety standards  that align with  US interests  while 
balancing security and economic priorities.  
5.Promote  AI Alignment Research  – The U S should invest in research on  AI
interpretability  and value alignment  to ensure AI systems operate within security
constraints.  Initiatives such as  Robust Open Online Safety Tools ( ROOST )7 that
promote open -source safety software and tools should be encouraged .
6.Avoid Miscalculations with Weapons . Given the increasing role of AI in defense, the
US should explore strategic stability agreements  with  China8 and Russia  to ensure
that AI is  not misused for nuclear command and control operations. Such
agreements  should not limit US AI defense advancements  but can help  prevent
misunderstandings or escalatory risks in military AI applications . The  US should
engage in dialogue with other leading AI powers to promote stability and prevent
miscalculations in military AI applications.
7.Modernize Department of Defense (DoD) Policies  – As warfare automation
accelerates, "human in the loop" will increasingly mean  embedding human
judgment9 in decision -making  rather than direct intervention in every decision cycle.
To ensure AI systems remain  controlled and non -escalatory , human oversight must
be hardwired10 into system design  before conflicts arise. The DoD should
implement  rigorous modeling, simulation tools, and real -time AI decision support
systems, ensuring that  US defense remains superior while AI systems function
reliably in mission -critical applications  and that AI decision support avoids escalation
bias.
Rather than approaching AI regulation with  heavy -handed government intervention,  the US 
must lead through a balanced strategy that strengthens AI governance while maintaining 
flexibility for innovation. By  shaping global AI safety standards, supporting public -private  risk 
management frameworks, and modernizing AI oversight in national security applications, the

 4 US can  mitigate risks without compromising its leadership in AI -driven economic and military 
capabilities.  
2. Securing US AI Leadership and Economic Competitiveness  
AI is not just a technological race —it is a contest of governance models that will shape global 
power, economic growth, and individual freedoms. The US must ensure that  democratic AI that 
empowers citizens remains stronger ,11 safer, and more influential  than its authoritarian 
counterparts  that seek to control citizens . Only by staying ahead in AI can the US sustain it  
economic competitiveness that underwrites its prosperity, security and values.   
Action Steps to Strengthen US AI Leadership and Economic Competitiveness  
- Offense  
1. Invest in AI Talent Pipeline  – China graduates  twice12 the number of Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) PhDs as the US. With the US  ranking13 near 
the bottom in the percentage of graduates pursuing STEM fields, it has long relied on 
attracting the world’s best and brightest. Visas for Chinese students and academics 
have  fallen14 by two -thirds since peaking in 2015. A recent  surge15 in students from India 
is taking up some of the slack. It is important that policies and a welcoming environment 
continue to attract the global AI talent essential to US tech leadership while 
also investing16 more in STEM education for American students.  
2. Provide Access to High -Performance Compute Power  – Establish a  national AI compute 
network17 to support research universities .18 Increase  domestic semiconductor 
production  and high -performance computing (HPC) resources  to support  AI research 
and private -sector innovation . Gain a decisive lead in emerging technologies that 
promise faster and greener compute power, such as  optical19 computing (using  laser

3.Secure  Data  – Secure access to unbiased, high -quality data  for US AI researchers .
Consider which datasets should be restricted from strategic competitors. Counter
China's  growing control over  the data flowing through  global telecommunications
(Huawei, ZTE)  and logistics22 (LOGINK) software , while promot ing secure, US -aligned
alternatives .
4.Fund Research  – Fully fund research23 as authorized in the  CHIPS and Science Act,
prioritizing AI and other technologies that will shape tomorrow like quantum, biotech
and nanotechnology. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development  (OECD) , China recently  overtook24 the US in research funding at
universities and government entities. Unless funding trends are reversed China will soon
overtake25 the US in total research funding.  The US must  ensure  American institutions
remain the world’s AI research hubs.
5.Invest in AI for Economic Competitiveness  – Support AI -driven innovation across key
industries  (healthcare, manufacturing, energy, finance) by  incentivizing AI adoption in
small businesses  and expanding AI -driven workforce training programs.  The goal should
be for AI to enhance productivity and job creatio n to ensure continued opportunities for
American workers.

6.Leverage AI for National Security Superiority  – Expand AI -driven cybersecurity
measures, real -time threat detection, and AI -powered intelligence
capabilities.  Modernize DoD procurement  to rapidly integrate  AI-driven military
applications,  ensuring  US military dominance in AI -powered defense systems.
7.Secure AI Supply Chain  – Reduce dependence on adversarial nations for rare earth
materials, semiconductors, and cloud computing infrastructure.  Mitigate risks posed by
foreign adversaries exploiting digitally driven devices and information platforms to
safeguard national security, economic stability, and democratic integrity.

 6 Establish  secure, US -led AI supply chains  to prevent exploitation by strategic 
competitors  and strengthen US economic resilience.  
8. Calibrate AI Export Controls  – Restrict AI -enabling technology exports that could 
accelerate competitors’ military capabilities  while ensuring26 export policies do not 
inadvertently accelerate their self -sufficiency, pairing restrictions with strategic tech -
sharing among democratic allies and deployment to the greatest extent possible to 
emerging markets .27 AI export policies should  balance security needs with economic 
competitiveness . 
9. Enhance  AI Model Security & Oversight  – Both  open -weight and closed AI models  pose 
security risks. Open -weight models  are vulnerable to  adversarial fine -tuning and misuse, 
while  closed models  risk hidden biases and covert data collection. The  AI Dispersion 
Framework  28has mitigated some threats by  restricting AI compute power and frontier 
model access  (though it overreaches29 potentially giving China the advantage in 
emerging markets) . Develop  safeguards to prevent misuse of open -weight AI  and to 
restrict usage of foreign -developed AI in sensitive sectors  as necessary to 
protect  national security.  
10. Influence International AI Standards  – The US must lead in shaping global AI 
governance to ensure international standards  protect individual liberties, foster 
innovation, and strengthen economic and national security.  As China exports its  state -
controlled AI model  and the EU30 imposes  restrictive regulations, fragmented policies 
risk undermining American competitiveness and personal freedoms.  By 
advancing  transparent, market -driven AI standards, collaborating with allies and 
industry, and aligning AI export controls with strate gic interests, the US can  champion 
an AI future that empowers citizens  and reinforces democratic values while maintaining 
technological leadership.  
By prioritizing AI investment, talent development, and infrastructure security,  the US 
can maintain global AI leadership without unnecessary regulatory burdens.  A pro-innovation 
approach  will ensure that  AI remains an engine of American economic strength a nd military 
superiority. With  a strong focus on both economic expansion and national security,  the US 
will continue setting the global AI agenda —rather than reacting to authoritarian models.

7 3. Retaining Collaborative Government Oversight of AI Industry
As AI transforms industries and global competition intensifies,  America’s tech leaders must 
remain strategic assets in national security and economic strength.  Unlike China’s centralized 
control over firms like Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, the  US has succ eeded by fostering 
innovation through a free -market approach.  Ensuring AI advances national security and 
economic priorities  requires  a balanced, pro -innovation strategy  that encourages  responsible 
corporate leadership  without stifling growth. Instead of  burdensome government 
intervention,  AI oversight should be  a collaborative31 effort  between  industry, government, and 
research institutions  to strengthen US AI competitiveness while preserving national interests . 
Action Steps for AI Corporate Oversight  
1.Ensure AI Innovation Aligns with National Security  – Work with AI firms to ensure  US
leadership in AI -driven defense, cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure  while
preventing partnerships that  compromise US strategic interests.
2.Foster Competitive AI Markets  – Avoid unnecessary regulatory overreach  while
ensuring  a dynamic and competitive AI sector  that rewards innovation and market -
driven expansion.
3.Maintain AI Infrastructure Sovereignty  – Strengthen domestic AI
infrastructure  through  public -private partnerships  that expand compute access and data
set access to research universities and entrepreneurs. Ensure  America —not foreign
adversaries —dominates AI supply chains.
4.Encourage Responsible AI Governance by Tech Firms  – Work with AI firms to  develop
voluntary AI safety frameworks, ensuring  responsible innovation  without heavy -handed
government mandates. Support  free speech principles while  countering AI -driven
disinformation.
The US must resist overreach that could stifle AI progress  and instead  leverage industry 
strengths  to keep AI development aligned with national priorities.  By fostering  a strong public -
private partnership,  America can  preserve innovation, economic leadersh ip, and global AI 
ascendency —without adopting China’s heavy -handed control over its tech sector.  
4. Address Societal Risks Posed by AI and Strengthen Democratic Institutions
AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and enhance decision -making.  However, it also 
introduces significant societal risks, including biases in decision -making, economic 
displacement, erosion of privacy, and the spread of disinformation.  If not carefully managed, AI 
could exacerbate socioeconomic inequalit ies and undermine democratic 
institutions.  Ensuring  AI benefits society while avoiding unnecessary restrictions  is critical 
to maintaining public trust, fostering economic prosperity, and countering authoritarian AI 
models.  
31 Partnership on AI, "Our Work,"  Partnership on AI , accessed March 2025,  https://partnershiponai.org/work/ . 


8 According to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, global trust in AI companies declined32 from 
61% to 53% over the past five years, with US trust levels dropping more sharply from 50% to 
35% during the same period.   America trusting AI less than the rest of the world could hinder its 
ability to maintain its leadership in AI innovation.  To reve rse this trend and ensure AI's 
beneficial integration, it is vital to address societal risks while enhancing public understanding 
of AI's role in national competitiveness and the risks of ceding leadership to nations like 
China.  As overly restrictive regulations could hinder progress, potentially allowing authoritarian 
regimes to gain an edge in AI development , a balanced approach is required . 
Action Steps to Address AI’s Societal Risks  
1.Ensure AI Fairness & Prevent Discrimination  – Support industry -led initiatives to reduce
AI bias and enhance system reliability, avoiding costly and restrictive government audits.
2.Mitigate AI’s Impact on Employment  – Expand  AI workforce training and job transition
programs, ensuring that  workers benefit from AI -driven productivity rather than being
displaced by it.  While OECD countries spend 4.9% of GDP33 on education, only a small
fraction of one percent is spent on adult education. Incentivize private -sector and
academic investment in AI reskilling  rather than relying solely on government programs.
3.Strengthen AI Transpare nt Government Use  – Promote  AI usage to provide 24/7
government34 services in a transparen t manner, enhancing the availability and ease of
accessing government services while  maintain ing trust and accountability.
4.Enhance Privacy & Data Protection  – Encourage industry -driven privacy
safeguards  that protect consumers while allowing AI -driven services to thrive.
5.Combat AI -Powered Disinformation While Preserving Free Speech  – Work with AI firms
to advance voluntary content labeling, misinformation detection, and deepfake
protections —without empowering  censorship frameworks that could restrict political
discourse.
6.Expand AI Literacy & Public Awareness  – Support AI education initiatives that help the
public  understand and responsibly use AI, recognizing its role in  job creation, national
security, and global competitiveness. Encourage programs that  equip individuals with
the skills to navigate AI -driven technologies  while fostering  critical thinking about AI’s
opportunities and risks.
7.Fair Value for Creators:  Support  market -driven agreements  ensuring fair compensation
for journalists, photographers, and other creators whose work trains AI models,
balancing  innovation with intellectual property rights  while avoiding restrictive
regulations.

9 8.Impact on Children:  Work with AI firms to develop voluntary safeguards protecting
children from harmful effects as AI shapes how they learn, play, and interact .
9.Environmental Sustainability:  Encourage industry -driven advancements in AI energy
efficiency, ensuring that  AI progress aligns with sustainable development.
10.Mental and Social Health:  Partner with tech companies to research AI’s influence on
mental health and implement best practices.
Rather than  overregulating AI and stifling growth, the US should  strengthen public confidence 
in AI through private -sector leadership, voluntary compliance, and strategic public -private 
collaboration.  By encouraging AI innovation, enhancing workforce readi ness, and ensuring 
responsible AI governance,  America can  foster trust in AI while maintaining its global edge.  
5.Extending AI’s Benefits to the World
AI is a  strategic asset that enhances US economic influence, strengthens alliances, and counters 
authoritarian models of AI governance.  The US must ensure that AI is  not only a tool of 
economic and military power but also a driver of global prosperity, sec urity, and democratic 
values.  China’s  Digital Silk Road  35is aggressively exporting  AI-driven surveillance, censorship, 
and state control, embedding  authoritarian AI models into developing economies.  If left 
unchecked,  China will dictate the future of AI governance, shaping global norms to favor  state 
control ove r individual freedoms and economic independence.  The US must act 
decisively  to strengthen AI partnerships with allies, promote free -market , citizen -empowering  
AI ecosystems, and provide a compelling alternative to authoritarian AI exports.  
Key Steps to Democratize AI Globally  
1.Support  AI Infrastructure  – Encourage  AI adoption in allied and emerging
economies  through  public -private partnerships, investment incentives, and financing
from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)36 and the Export -
Import Bank.  By expanding US AI infrastructure abroad,  America  can counterbalance
China’s Digital Silk Road and establish a free -market , empowering  AI ecosystem.
2.Expand Global AI Education & Workforce Training  – Position American universities and
tech companies as the premier hubs for AI education and training.  Strengthen  US-led AI
certification programs, university partnerships, and technical training initiatives  in
developing economies to  solidify US leadership in AI knowledge transfer.
3.Leverage AI for Sustainable Development  – Encourage  US AI -driven innovations in
healthcare, crisis response, and sustainability  to drive economic growth in partner
nations  while  reinforcing democratic norms.  Expand AI -driven  agriculture, logistics, and
fintech solutions  to strengthen  global supply  chain resilience and economic stability.

 10 4. Provide Open and Democratic AI Solutions  – Provide AI solutions that enhance security, 
economic growth, and digital freedom  while  preventing authoritarian AI models from 
embedding state surveillance into global infrastructure.  Support democratic AI 
governance models  that align with  US economic and security interests.  
5. Strengthen Cultural & Linguistic AI Applications : Encourage  AI applications that 
promote linguistic diversity and cultural preservation, ensuring AI systems reflect the 
values of diverse global communities  while maintaining  US technological leadership in 
AI-driven communication tools.  
By expanding AI infrastructure investment, strengthening AI education, and providing a 
superior alternative to China’s AI exports,  the US can  position itself as the global leader in AI 
development.  This pro-innovation , pro -democracy AI strategy  will strengthen alliances, create 
new economic opportunities, and reinforce the US as the preferred AI partner for developing 
nations. The  US must act swiftly and decisively  to ensure  AI benefits all nations while securing 
American economic and geopolitical leadershi p in AI -driven technologies.  
 
Conclusion  
AI is the defining technology of the 21st century, and how it is developed, regulated, and 
deployed will shape the world for decades to come. The US must lead —not just to 
maintain  technological superiority,  but to lead in ensuring that AI serves humanity rather than 
becoming a tool for authoritarian expansion. By implementing safeguards to  keep AI under 
human control,  investing America’s  AI leadership,  ensuring collaborative government 
oversight,  mitigating AI’s societal risks, and  extending AI’s benefits w orldwide, the US can 
secure a future in which AI is a force for prosperity, security, and freedom.  
AI leadership is not just a  technological race —it is a  competition for the future of global 
influence , economic power  and human progress . The US must  take bold actio n to secure its 
position as the  world’s AI leader, ensuring that AI strengthens free markets, safeguards national 
security, and fuels liberty and prosperity for generations to come.  The time to act is now.
