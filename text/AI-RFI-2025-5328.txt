General Comment
AI is a scam . Its bubble is about to burst. Letting a known scam m er pillage the copyright system  to "im prove" his hallucinating chatbots
will not help national security--if anything, the reverse. Entertainm ent is Am erica's last big export and "developing" AI will only dam age
that vital crop.
