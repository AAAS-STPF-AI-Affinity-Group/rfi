Human beings can make - and do, and always will - make new and innovative art and solve
creative problems. Generative AI is not only unnecessary, but a detriment to progress,innovation, aesthetics, AND allowing Gen AI engines to steal freely from existing art -currently covered by various national and international copyright laws - is at best a cheap-ass,underhanded move to get out of paying the people who originally developedstyles/character/worlds/techniques.
 
Can you really, with enthusiasm, say Yes! to highway robbery - nay, sanctioned plagiarism -especially when it can only dry up innovation and "create" blenderized copies of copies. A poxon your faux innovation.
 
sincerely,  
A.S. Koiconcept & production artist for film, stage, and graphic media
