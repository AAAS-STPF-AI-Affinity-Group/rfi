General Comment
AI as it is used now is theft. If the governm ent is to push forward with AI initiatives, they m ust do so in a way that is consensual to those
who the m odel is training from . Consensual does NOT m ean that in order to participate in certain platform s, the user m ust consent to
bring a part of the training. X.com  is a great exam ple of how NOT to im plem ent training.
