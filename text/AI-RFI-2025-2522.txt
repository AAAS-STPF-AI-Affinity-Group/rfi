Do not allow any big tech to stea l from and pro fit off artists. Allowing this is a cr ime against the human soul. If they are a llowed to co ntinue 
plundering it's going to plunge us into an era o f creat ive bankruptcy if we aren't already running towards it at break neck speed. Everything 
that people love and makes life worth  living is made by  artists. If  you  allow th is to be destroyed and can nibalized everyth ing will 
decay  i nto em pty  worth less garbage. Real  artists w ill wither, lose passion  or stop shari ng their works and everyth ing will f&^%
