General Comment
I strongly oppose giving AI com panies the right to ignore copyright and suck up and regurgitate inform ation without any lim itations. These
com panies need to be regulated and forced to pay for their theft, and if they feel they cannot survive without wholesale theft of inform ation
then they do not deserve to survive. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US infrastructure since it cannot create on its
own and is vastly overhyped for its capabilities and future prospects. It has been far oversold to the Am erican public by people who are
just trying to fleece people before their industry collapses. Weâ€™ve seen entire industries flailing because executives think AI can replace
hum ans, and it sim ply cannot. Moreover as a creative person AI steals from  artists and creators violating our copyrights and creative
energies. AI seeks to rem ove the soul from  civilization and creative endeavors, and it m ust be restricted.
