General Comment
Generative Ai represents a threat to all creatives and creativity itself, in that it only statistically regurgitates past work, from  a m assive
derivative work that is the al m odel itself, forcing creative professionals to com pete against their own work. This includes both work from
the past and each new work they m ake that is used to train new m odels. This de-incentivizes innovation and growth in creative fields by
real creative hum an beings, resulting in the brain drain of an entire field of hum an endeavor. What is left will be a m achine presum ed to be
“creative” that does not think as we do, whose referential gaze is perm anently directed to an ever m ore distant past. Our only reasonable
option is to expand intellectual property law to encom pass this new technology and m edia, and bring it under sim ilar constraints that
reigned in peer to peer file sharing in the early 2000’s.
