General Comment
Generative AI in all its present form  is theft of skilled work be it writing, coding, voice work or art. GenAI training on work without
consent and/or com pensation is also a personal violation another’s skill and also violates copyrighted works.
Studies have also shown that it causes skills and critical thinking to decline. The AU governm ent found that ChatGPT has a 40% error
rate.
Additionally, its a waste of tim e, energy and everyone I know its tired of it being shoved into every corner of life, adding nothing of value
and heaping on a extra hassle.
It also runs the risk of collecting personal data without consent and could create data breaches or things like HIPPA violations in tim e.
Finally, it’s a lam e fad. One that will likely die out and leave problem s for copyright law in its wake. Don’t give OpenAI any m ore oxygen.
They and others m ade a bad investm ent and Am ericans should not have to lose their work and livelihoods to a fad.
