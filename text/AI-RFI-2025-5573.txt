General Comment
If a business is built on stolen work to function, that business should not exist, plain and sim ple. If m y art is found in a m odel, then that
entire m odel m ust be destroyed. Either that or you're opening the door to legalize all form s of theft and piracy, destroying all copyright
regulation.
It m ust be utterly illegal for a m odel to be trained on unauthorized data, and any m odel found to be trained on that data m ust be destroyed.
Further, any executive at a com pany found responsible for this should be treated just as som eone pirating excess am ounts of m usic or
gam es. Jail tim e should be a serious deterrent.
I'm  watching people sell art of DC Com ics characters as if they created Superm an them selves; AI allows unsavory individuals to com pete
with the artists who own the copyright. If you allow AI to train on copyright data, you are allowing it to violate the entire legal precedent of
copyright.
