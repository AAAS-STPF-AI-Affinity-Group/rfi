General Comment
I am  a writer who believes that A.I Technologies such as ChatGPT and other software such as those will be m ore harm ful than good.
They will continue to steal the hard work of writers, artist, and others in different fields that require critical thinking. Instead A.I will
continue to consum e m assive am ounts of energy and water, putting our planet even m ore at risk. We will then have to create laws that
would stop m isinform ation or fake im agery that already runs ram pant. So I am  asking that the governm ent continues to run and operate as
it has been without the need of A.I Technologies.
