General Comment
Allowing AI to access this inform ation is a m assive privacy violation. Furtherm ore, AI is being forced upon the Am erican people, who
have explicitly stated they do not want to buy it. AI has no future, and attem pting to pretend it does will bring about the downfall of
Am erican civilization.
