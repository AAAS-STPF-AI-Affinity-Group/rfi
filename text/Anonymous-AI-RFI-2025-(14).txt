This AI Action plan would devastate the rest of the world if you let it happen with the likes of 
the Bi g Tech Corporations. Since it would stop the creatives from creating new things. Like new 
shows, new movies, new songs. If you only hear one side of the argument. The 'Fair Use' clause 
only applies if the offending party does not invalidate the rights of the makers of the original source material by not directly competing against the source material. (i.e. education, etc.) But the generative AI companies are having a model where they can directly compete against the source material, effectively cutting the maker of the aforementioned source material to make a living, by the AIs powers of mass production. The lawsuits against the Generative AI corporations have already piled up. And what the generative AI companies are saying is essentially that they "Don't care even if people make porn with our technology, just let us steal." Let's not legalize theft.
