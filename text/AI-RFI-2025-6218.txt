General Comment
I believe generative AI is a fad with no practical usage. It requires im m ense am ounts of data to provide lackluster results and is not
im proving by whatever m easures "im provem ent" is classified as by its creators. It requires too m uch electricity and water to run for, again,
no benefit.
Personally, I find generative AI im practical, unim pressive, a waste of natural resources, and a m echanism  to steal from  the livelihoods of
working artists and authors. I will not support generative AI and will actively avoid any m edia or products utilizing generative AI. I believe
all existing and potential future m odels should NOT be perm itted to train off copyrighted m aterial. It has no future and no potential.
