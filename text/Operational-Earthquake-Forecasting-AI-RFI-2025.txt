-2 -Response to OSTP & NITRD NCO on AI Action Plan Development 
Advancing AI for National Security & Disaster Resilience: AI -Based Earthquake 
Forecasting and Nowcasting  Action Plan  
The United States has a critical opportunity to leverage AI-driven forecasting technologies to 
strengthen national security, infrastructure resilience, and disaster preparedness. Precursor 
SPC’s AI-based Earthquake Forecasting and Nowcasting deliver high-confidence, deterministic, real-time warnings that shift earthquake response from reactive to proactive. 
Current earthquake warning systems fail to provide location- and time-specific alerts, leaving 
governments, businesses, and insurers unable to mitigate risk or take protective action . Unlike 
traditional seismology-based methods that only detect earthquakes after they occur, AI-based forecasting and nowcasting identifies pre -seismic energy buildup days in advance, allowing 
for risk mitigation, preparedness, and strategic response planning. Precursor’s AI-based technology is operational, proven, and ready for immediate deployment to reduce economic 
losses, infrastructure damage, and loss of life. 
Policy Actions for AI Leadership & Innovation  
To ensure the U.S. remains at the forefront of AI innovation, the AI Action Plan for Earthquake Forecasting and Nowcasting must: 
1. Establish strong Public -Private Collaboration for AI-Based Earthquake Forecasting and
Nowcasting
Federal agencies must collaborate with AI innovators like Precursor SPC to 
integrate Earthquake Forecasting and Nowcasting into national resilience frameworks. A public-private partnership (PPP) would: 
✅Enable deterministic, days-in-advance earthquake forecasting and
nowcasting to protect lives and infrastructure.
✅Modernize USGS’s ShakeAlert system from a reactionary seismology-basedsystem into an AI-driven forecasting and nowcasting platform for disaster
preparedness.
✅Provide governments, businesses, and insurers with actionable
intelligence for risk management, infrastructure protection, and operational
continuity.
2. Remove Regulatory Barriers to AI-Driven Earthquake Forecasting
Current U.S. regulations do not recognize AI-based earthquake forecasting as a viable
alternative to outdated seismology-based methods. The AI Action Plan must: 


-3 -
✅Direct USGS, FEMA, and DHS to establish a regulatory pathway for AI-driven
earthquake forecasting and nowcasting.
✅Prevent bureaucratic inertia from delaying life-saving forecasting solutions.
✅Ensure AI-based forecasting systems are fast-tracked for validation anddeployment.
3. Prioritize AI for Infrastructure Resilience & Risk Mitigation
AI-based nowcasting is a strategic asset for national disaster preparedness and risk
management. The AI Action Plan must: 
✅Expand funding for AI-driven Earthquake Forecasting and Nowcasting,
ensuring resilient infrastructure and economic stability.
✅Support AI integration into government and private-sector risk mitigationframeworks, providing high-confidence, location-specific alerts that allow for
early action.
4. Provide Immediate Appropriations for Operational Deployment
The AI Action Plan must provide specific appropriations for the immediate operational deployment of AI-driven earthquake forecasting and nowcasting capabilities rather than 
restricting funding to long-term R&D initiatives. AI-based Earthquake Forecasting and 
Nowcasting are proven technologies at TRL 7-8, ready for national-scale implementation. Appropriations must:  
✅Fund real-time operational deployment to protect critical infrastructure,
commercial enterprises, and government agencies .
✅Ensure rapid fielding of AI-driven earthquake forecastingsolutions within DHS  and state/local emergency management agencies .
✅Support multi-agency AI partnerships to scale operational capabilities withoutunnecessary delays.
5. Incentivize Private Sector & Insurance Industry Engagement
The AI Action Plan must require active and financial support from private insurance 
and reinsurance providers to drive the adoption of Earthquake Forecasting and 
Nowcasting solutions within commercial and industrial markets. AI-driven forecasting 
offers insurers and risk managers a revolutionary tool to enhance resilience, reduce 
losses, and improve financial modeling of seismic risk. The Plan should:  
✅Incentivize private insurers and reinsurers to introduce AI-driven earthquake
forecasting products to their commercial and industrial clients.


-4 -
✅Establish industry-wide collaboration between the federal government,
insurers, and AI solution providers to ensure widespread adoption and risk
management integration.
✅Require insurance-backed earthquake resilience strategies to leverage AI-driven
forecasts for pre -event mitigation and preparedness rather than solely relying on
post-event claims and recovery efforts.
Precursor SPC: A Proven Solution for AI -Driven Earthquake Forecasting and 
Nowcasting  
Precursor SPC delivers real-time, AI/ML-driven Earthquake Forecasting and Nowcasting, providing actionable intelligence to mitigate risk, enhance operational resilience, and 
enable proactive decision-making. 
•AI-Based Earthquake Nowcasting provides deterministic, location- and time-specific
earthquake warnings by identifying pre-seismic energy buildup, offering governments,
businesses, and insurers the ability to prepare and mitigate economic losses [Precursor
SPC, 2013, 2017, 2018].
•Peer-reviewed research supports the viability of ionospheric anomalies as precursors toseismic activity, a foundation of Precursor SPC’s forecasting model [Precursor SPC,
2017, 2022].
•The European Space Agency’s INSPIRE project has also validated pre-seismic energybuildup as a verified approach to earthquake forecasting, further affirming the potential
of Precursor SPC’s methods [INSPIRE, ESA, 2021].
•Unlike traditional seismology-based methods, AI-driven forecasting offers high-confidence alerts days in advance, allowing for disaster preparedness, emergency
planning, and risk reduction.
By integrating AI-driven Earthquake Forecasting and Nowcasting, OSTP and NITRD 
NCO can position the U.S. as a global leader in AI-based disaster forecasting, ensuring lives saved, infrastructure protected, and economic resilience sustained. 
Conclusion: AI Earthquake Forecasting & Nowcasting Are Critical for U.S. AI 
Leadership  
The AI Action Plan must remove barriers to AI-driven disaster forecasting and enable 
public-private collaboration to deploy Earthquake Forecasting and Nowcasting at scale. 
The West Coast and Alaska face inevitable seismic catastrophes, with billions in economic losses and thousands of lives at risk. AI-driven forecasting provides a viable, operational 
solution that must be deployed now. 


-5 -The time to act is now—AI-based Earthquake Forecasting and Nowcasting can transform 
resilience, protect critical assets, and save lives . OSTP must champion AI-driven 
forecasting innovation and ensure that immediate appropriations support the deployment of operational AI capabilities, not just additional R&D. This will enable the U.S. to lead in AI-
driven disaster preparedness, infrastructure resilience, and national security.
