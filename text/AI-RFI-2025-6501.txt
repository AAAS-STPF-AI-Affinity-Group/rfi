General Comment
We cannot allow big tech to steal the work of hardworking Am ericans and m ake m oney on the backs of those actually putting in the
work. AI should not be trained or built upon the work of anyone else without explicit consent and perm ission and a way for these big tech
com panies to com pensate the true workers for their hard work and effort. Just because som ething has been posted to the internet does
not autom atically release the license or copyright of that work to the public, this is how it works for everything and everyone and we all
m ust adhere to these laws. The original creator still has rights and ownership of that work. If we give AI com panies special perm ission to
evade the law without repercussion, then we are taking away the rights of hardworking Am ericans.
