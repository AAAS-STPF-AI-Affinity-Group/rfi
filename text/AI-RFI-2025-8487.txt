General Comment
I believe AI holds no place in our am erican future, as it stifles the creative spirit of am erican artists. This includes and is not lim ited to
writers, 2D artists, anim ators, 3D artists, and m usicians. It also has a negative im pact in our education being both underm onitored, and
abused by students to bypass educational requirem ents. AI profits off of theft of hum an creation, and allowing it to steal further from  artists
will only discourage them  from  creating art any further. This will do no good put foreign nations ahead of us in creativity, in education, and
in production of m edia
