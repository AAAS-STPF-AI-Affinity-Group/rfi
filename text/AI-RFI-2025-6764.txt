General Comment
It's anti-artist, anti-creator, and straight up anti-Am erican to gut copyright law to benefit a handful of com panies. If this data is worth
som ething to them , it's worth paying for. Anything less than that is condoning stealing. Even the governm ent can't take property for public
good for free--if they do em inent dom ain, they have to pay a fair price. This is ridiculous and it's insulting that they even feel em boldened
to ask for it.
