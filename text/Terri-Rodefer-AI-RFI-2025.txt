Hello!
I writing to oppose the AI Action Plan. Here's why:1. Currently Google uses AI to censor publishers it doesn't like, that's
not fair2. Ad networks currently are kicking out those publishers that useAI-generated content or images (so the industry is policing this matterto protect original content)3. Copyright protects creators and allows for unique content to becreated without fear of stealing (AI steals original content)4. AI being boosted in this way, hurts small businesses or hobbies, likemine.5. AI favors big tech and punishes small, unique creators like mine.
Simply put, AI doesn't level the playing field, it makes it incredibly
unlevel and throws us small creators into a massive hole.
Thank you for your consideration in this matter!Terri Rodefertailwagwisdom.com________________________________All e-mails to and from this account are for NITRD official use only and subject to certain disclosure requirements.
