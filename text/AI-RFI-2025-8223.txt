General Comment
I oppose letting AI com panies have free access to copyrighted works, and then plagiarize the contents of those works for generative
output that they sell. 
I do not believe generative AI has the potential to create value for business in general, but it does have the potential to harm  authors and
other creators, who do genuinely add value to our society.
I believe that generative AI is a m oney sink that is currently overvalued, and that any regulations that cost the private sector m oney or
protect hum an creators will be deem ed "unnecessarily burdensom e" by AI com panies. All effective regulations that prevent bad actions,
including theft or fraud, are "unnecessarily burdensom e" to those seeking illicit profit.
