General Comment
The use of "AI" is an incredibly m isleading term , com ing from  a Silicon Valley so afraid losing relevance that it has conflated "Artificial
Intelligence" with "Learned Language Model." Allowing these m orons to have their way will create m ore problem s than it could ever
possibly hope to solve, as their desperation to get on the second com ing of the "Dot Com  Boom " has created such m onstrous failures as
crypto currencies, non-fungible tokens, and various other grifts. Before we even get to alleged benefits of these LLMs they pretend are AI
as depicted in science fiction, this technology is grossly inefficient in both power consum ption and general use. It cannot produce new
things, it cannot becom e self-aware and m ake decisions, it is a glorified parrot that squawks whatever som e Silicon Valley "techbro"
decides is revolutionary. These "techbros" have abused sentim ents from  80s and 90s business executives to m ake a m ockery of film  and
art industries, and should not ever be allowed to have any kind of legal defense in their disgusting overestim ating of their own worth. These
techbros have produced nothing that is valuable to the average Am erican, and have only devalued the industries they stick their grubby
fingers. Because of this, it is im perative that no legislative official in the United States does anything but ridicule proponents of AI and
dism iss any bills they propose.
