General Comment
The current slate of AI initiatives not only m aterially steal from  Am erican citizens in the form  of intellectual property and lost incom e, but
they don't even have anything to offer for our future as a nation in return: the products involved are overhyped and the industries that have
begun to incorporate them  are already regretting it. There's nothing that needs to be further researched or understood here; AI should in
no way be a priority for our resources as a nation right now.
