General Comment
As som eone who writes stories, I'm  fully against AI getting free reign to just take things from  other writers/artists/creators, taking away
hum an's expressions of creativity, and just slopping a bunch of other people's hard work together into sludge for big com panies to profit
off of while said creators that were stolen from  have to rely on gofundm e to eat.
