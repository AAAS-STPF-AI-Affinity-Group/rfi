Hello Faisal. Details re: my work: thebiggestshort dot substack dot com/p/natsec-and-trump-
money-via-my-microsoft-amazon-vc-praised-ai (Substack dot com is a popular content-
hosting platform); excerpt (minus Web links):
My Microsoft-/Amazon-/VC-praised* AI-preneurship is a key to President 
Trump achieving “stable mutual deterrence” (SMD), given: 1) autocrats with  
nukes who perceive themselves to be imperiled by ongoing research-advances 
(esp. in molecular-genetics, neuroscience and AI)**, 2) my SMD-blueprint
(SBP), via my tenure since 2016 as an/the-world’s-most accidental threat-
analyst; via SBP yielding SMD: 1) Rockefeller of the AI economy (e.g.,  
President Trump delegates emergency/war powers en route to legally owning  
80% of “my” Amazon.com of customized-education and AI***; CE-for-AI will  
be to the AI economy what oil has been to the industrial economy); 2) undoing  
of a catch-22 worsened by DeepSeek: China’s AI-progress decreases said nuke-
risk-to-U.S. by increasing risk-to-U.S. of China being first to an Artificial 
General Intelligence that confers decisive military-advantage—and the reverse  
is true: less AGI-risk-to-U.S. means more nuke-risk****.

** This perception is plausible/likely (e.g., fits relevant data); details below (db).
