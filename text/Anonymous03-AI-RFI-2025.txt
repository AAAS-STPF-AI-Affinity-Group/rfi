Open AI's request for unrestricted freedom to violate copyright represents an unprecedented
violation of intellectual property rights. This would not only violate the spirit of those rights,but any practical means of defending them under any scenario. Open AI's interests are not inthe future of any industry besides their own, one which has yet to provide any meaningfulbenefit for society and only provide tools for scammers and fly by night salesmen. AIdevelopment companies must demonstrate the real value of their products, not some imaginedhypothetical future development. They should justify their continued existence first, let alonebe granted extraordinary exceptions to the law. So far the only shown effects of "AI"technology have been vast wastes of energy and the proliferation of misinformation. My nameis James McKnight and I vehemently oppose any deregulation of the AI industry.
