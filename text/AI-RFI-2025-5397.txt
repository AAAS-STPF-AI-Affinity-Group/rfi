General Comment
Let's be blunt with what you're trying to push here - you're trying to legalize theft at a scale previously unseen, all because big business
finds it inconvenient to abide by the sam e laws that countless creators have found used by corporate lawyers to crush them . 
AI com panies should not be perm itted to sim ply steal data and laugh off copyright because it's inconvenient to have to pay licensing fees
or be barred from  blatantly ripping off copyrighted m aterial. AI is not transform ative. AI is not creative. AI com panies are sim ply flailing as
they realize they've pum ped up a hype bubble for their investors and they will fall down a chasm  if they aren't allowed to steal from
whom ever they please.
