General Comment
Ban the use of generative artificial intelligence. It has done nothing but destroy jobs, steal, and benefit large corporations who m ake
everything worse. It's com pletely unsustainable and costs an excessive am ount of energy to use. At one point, OpenAI, owners of
ChatGPT, was losing $700,000 a day just running the service. It has no place in our future, and we are counting on you to do the right
thing and not allow AI m odels to be exem pt from  copyright law.
