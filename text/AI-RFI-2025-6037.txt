General Comment
Please do not use copyrighted work including published art, writing, video, pictures, etc. to train AI. Itâ€™s theft. Please m ake AI opt IN vs
opt OUT. Autom atically applying AI and burying the opt out toggle/button in the settings is m anipulative and unethical. Please pay
attention to how AI is being used to m anipulate public opinion and spread disinform ation and correct the issues causing this. There need to
be laws in place to protect potential victim s of AI im age/video abuse, those cases have already been popping up all over the world and
the lack of accountability and justice has been extrem ely disheartening and worrying.
