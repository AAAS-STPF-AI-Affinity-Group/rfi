Re: National Science Foundationâ€™s Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
When I turn 18 in a couple m onths, i want to becom e a Com ic Book Illustrator, Like Frank Miller and Erik Larsen. If this new bill allows
for AI com panies to use any m aterial to train them , i will never get that chance. 
People who m ake com ics have it hard enough without theirjobs being on the chopping board for Artificial Intelligence. Being one f the
least respected professions in the world, we do not have a union and are subject to freelance work. if this new bill is to pass, our careers
are over, as the corporate suits will love cutting corners and replacing us with cold unfeeling robots. Com ics were once a tool to express
ourselves with, and this is a m edium  that is very near and dear to m y heart. so i will not let it be taken over by robots who cant even use a
pencil. I do not support artificial intelligence being used creatively in any fashion whatsoever. please do not vote yes on this bill.
