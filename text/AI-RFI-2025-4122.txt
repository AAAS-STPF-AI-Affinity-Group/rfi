General Comment
The idea of this plan would be absolutely disatorus to creative business. AI has failed to produce anything of a return on the m assive
am ounts of m oney spent on it.
In addition, it would be very easy to m ake m isinform ation. It would spread like wildfire, and m uch of it could easily be m anipulated against
the Federal Governm ent.
All in all, it would be for the best interests of the adm inistration to reject this plan instead of giving it any thought.
