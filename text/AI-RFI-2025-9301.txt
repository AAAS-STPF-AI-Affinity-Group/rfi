General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is an extrem ely powerful and unique tool that can absolutely be used to enhance our lives in a m ultitude of ways.
However, like all great things, it m ust be properly im plem ented to truly live up to its purpose. 
AI needs to be regulated. There need to be "burdensom e" policies. There has to be rules. We cannot allow such m assive technology to
sim ply exist and do as it pleases - there's so m uch danger in that idea. We already struggle everyday with new technological cases and
issues at every level: technology is rapidly evolving and it needs to be handled & addressed correctly to prevent m isuse & abuse of its
abilities. 
It would absolutely be devastating to willingly forego the chance to regulate AI and allow it to wreak havoc, sim ply to alleviate ourselves
of the "burden" of doing so. People deserve safe, well-tested, ethically-designed technology. What is the point of technology if it won't
properly serve us?
