General Comment
I think the obvious solution to the problem  of training AI on large data sets, data sets which include copyrighted works, is to abolish
copyright. I think the easiest and m ost elegant solution is to abolish copyright. And lastly and m ost im portantly, I think the fairest way to
enable AI research is to abolish copyright. OpenAI claim s quite desperately that copyright law is an im pedim ent to AI research, and if
they need an exem ption from  copyright law, I certainly see no reason why an exem ption should apply to them  alone. Donald Trum p and
Elon Musk have preached cutting governm ent red tape and supercharging the econom y, and I can think of no better way to practice what
they preach. Help Am erica. Free Am erica from  the tyranny of century-ling copyrights.
