General Comment
The intent behind copyright -- behind intellectual property in general -- has always been to encourage the creation of m ore art (m ore
inventions, etc.) by protecting the right of the creator to profit from  their work, and thereby to support them selves in the creation of that
work. Allowing a corporation to ignore copyright in pursuit of m aking its own product that can then be used, and WILL be used, to
cannibalize the profits and therefore the livelihoods of creators, runs directly counter to the entire reason such laws exist. It m akes a
m ockery of our legal system , and while the current adm inistration appears to consider laws a m ere obstacle between them  and profits for
the chosen few, I hope we can continue to rely on other elem ents of our governm ent to hold the line on behalf of the citizen public.
