General Comment
As a life long artist, I want to say that AI has no place in the future of this country. It is not an “art”, or even creative. It uses m assive
am ounts of energy for each and every single im age. Im ages stolen from  artists and creators across all socio econom ic backgrounds. In
seconds it spits out a rubbery im age, with no com pensation or credit to the creatives it steals from , and no consequences for the
destructive use of water and energy, on the environm ent. 
As AI becom es m ore and m ore entrenched, you will see the quality of im ages becom e even worse than they already are. There is no
feeling, no soul, no creativity in these hollow im ages. And as they get worse, true creatives will suffer and start giving up as they cannot
com pete with these fake im ages, and people falling for them  will know less and less about what is truly wonderful and engaging about true
art, as our environm ent pays the price as well.
