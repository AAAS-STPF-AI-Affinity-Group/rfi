General Comment
Not only has this technology not proved to be a realible source of inform ation, the foundation of it is entirely powered off of bad-faith
stolen writing and artwork. Ultim ately, this plan would nationally devalue the hum an practice of com m unication. As an arts advocate,
practitioner, publisher, and enterprise technology professional, I find m yself consistently dum bfounded by the deep disconnect exhibited
the technocratic silicon valley investor class and the rest of hum anity.
Sorry there isn't another hyperscaler left, we shouldn't have to sacrifice fundam ental aspects of what m akes people people as well as an
insane breach of data privacy to prop up an over-bloated, aim less, and wasteful technology that has no viable product. This isn't
Weekend At Bernie's.
