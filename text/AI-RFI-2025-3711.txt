General Comment
Large language m odel and other artificial intelligence developers have no a priori right to anyone else's data, especially without prior
perm ission and uncom pensated. If a business m odel requires large-scale data theft on order to function, then it is a bad business that
deserves to fail. 
AI businesses are bad businesses that deserve to fail - they lose m oney hand over fist, fail to m eet prom ised benchm arks and kick the can
down the road indefinitely. They have already consum ed hundreds of billions of dollars, m ost of which is voluntarily spent yet I can't help
but think what research and im provem ents the hum an well-being could have occurred with those funds. They do not have any right to any
data that is not voluntarily given and certainly not without com pensation.
An author did not write a novel to help AI billionaires m ake m ore m oney. An artist didn't draw a picture to train the m achine that puts
them  out of work. It is an anti-hum an technology, burning billions in capital, to further enrich the already spectacularly wealthy.
It is to be regulated and m onitored, not loosed to feed on whatever it can find.
