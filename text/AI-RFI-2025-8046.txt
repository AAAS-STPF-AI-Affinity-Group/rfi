General Comment
Artificial Intelligence, prim arily LLMs (Large Language Models) or generative AI, devalues art and the works of m any form s of artists. It
encourages com panies to cut corners and unnecessarily axe jobs in artistic fields. Additionally, the size of data centers necessary for
running LLMs and generative AI m odels are enorm ous and expansive, resulting in m assive energy bills that consum e vast am ounts of
energy.
Furtherm ore, LLMs generally require large quantities of harvested data, typically copyrighted m aterial, in order to generate their results.
Many com panies and individuals alike did not consent to having their data scraped by com panies such as OpenAI, who argue that they
should be given free reign to harvest data for free, or else they will not be able to operate. This underm ines the purpose of copyrighted
m aterial, and is not only hypocritical, but threatens the nature of releasing copyrighted m aterial on the internet.
