General Comment
The AI industry has consum ed billions of dollars of funding and untold environm ental im pacts of its steep electricity and heavy m etal costs,
and has yet to provide m ore utility than cheating on your hom ework or a m ediocre chatbot. the industry is a dead end that will bring down
the entire econom y with it. Let the m arket solve itself without giving handouts to such econom ic dead weight. If corporations cannot profit
without unlim ited harvesting of intellectual property, it is doubtful they can with it.
