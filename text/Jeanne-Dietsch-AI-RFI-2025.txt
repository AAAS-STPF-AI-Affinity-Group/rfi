AI ACTION PLAN page 2  
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
This document addresses three problems that will slow beneﬁcial AI advancement over the next 
decade if not addressed. 1) Energy demand exceeds supply; 2) Popular resistance will likely arise 
against AI; and 3) Giving AI dangerous self -preserva@on needs.  
Means exist to mi@gate each of these issues, as summarized below . 
PROBLEM STATEMENTS  
1. ENERGY DEMAND EXCEEDS SUPPLY:  Skyrocke@ng energy demands from AI, 
cybercurrency, and increased commu@ng could cause mul@ple problems:  
•slow expansion of AI due to lack of energy 
•rising energy costs for businesses and consumers 
•failing transformers which have a replacement wait @me of 2 years  
•likely  long -term grid failure 
Some  secondary consequences of energy shortages would  be: 
• popular unrest  
•acts of terrorism against AI data centers 
•in the case of long-term grid disrup@on : economic, health, and social disaster 
2. POPULAR RESISTANCE AGAINST AI:  Job loss, unemployment, resentment, and 
fear could result in:  
•AI boycoJs, poli@cal resistance and general economic slowdown   
•acts of physical terrorism against AI data centers 
•cyber aJacks on dominant AI systems 
3. GIVING AI DANGEROUS SELF -PRESERVATION NEED S: Academic research has 
set goals for AI that compare its performance to human intelligence. This is misguided, ineﬃcient, and dangerous.  It is like breeding dragons to replace carriage horses, instead of 
inven@ng a n automobile to  speed transporta@on. Research in "embodied AI" or AI with 
simulated emo@onal feedback that leads to self-preserva@on needs is like breeding ﬁre and wings into a horse. It helps the horse, but it does not help humans. 
Current  work in alignment of AI with human needs focuses on output of the AI. The underlying 
founda@on of alignment, however, lies in system dependence versus independence. A system 


AI ACTION PLAN page 3  
that has no Markov Blanket, no boundaries between self and other, cannot seek self-
preserva@on. 
Currently, AI is powerful but fragile. It is not an en@ty separate from the control of its makers or 
the founda@onal infrastructure it relies on. Virtual, simulated embodiment within so`ware that 
could replicate and infect systems worldwide would  seek its own advantage, even though it 
would s@ll be dependent upon human support. Instan@ated in a network of robots and vehicles, and even some humans connected through direct-brain interfaces, AI would have the poten@al 
to become independent. The impact of such a superior power on humanity is unforeseeable. 
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS  
1.TO REDUCE THE GAP BETWEEN ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND:  Some 
ways to minimize the disparity between supply and demand to speed AI advancement, while 
keeping popular resentment in check, include: 
•SET ENERGY PRIORITIES: Giv e AI, business, and consumer needs priority over 
cybercurrency, perhaps through pricing or tax mechanisms 
•REVOKE CRUCIAL FUNDING MORATORIUM & RELEASE PAUSED FUNDS: Revoke the 
moratorium on wind projects and release paused funding of approved alterna@ve 
energy loans and grants, in addi@on to using  incen@ves for tradi@onal fuels 
•EXEMPT KEY GRID COMPONENTS FROM TARIFFS Exempt Grain Oriented Electrical Steel 
and other transformer raw materials and components from tariﬀs to reduce turn-around @me and cost for transformers 
•BAN CERTAIN STATE & LOCAL REGULATIONS: Ban state and local regula@on of independent community, business, and home solar and roo`op wind projects that do not feed into the grid, to encourage energy reliability and increase supply 
•REDUCE INEFFICIENT COMMUTING: Once personnel reduc@on goals have been achieved, remove the in-oﬃce requirement for federal employees that increases energy consump@on in commu@ng  
2.TO REDUCE POPULAR RESISTANCE TO AI : To encourage public acceptance and 
adop@on that will advance AI, rather than resistance and fear that would slow AI advancement: 
•AI COMPETITIONS: Involve students in compe@@ons applying augmented AI, modelled on FIRST Robo@cs and DARPA Grand Challenges 
•ASSISTIVE & AUGMENTATIVE AI VS. AUTONOMOUS: The  workforce  is dwindling  due to 
immigra@on policy, Boomer re@rements, and the GenZ demographic dip. Seek to magnify produc@vity among remaining workers by partnering with assis@ve and 


AI ACTION PLAN page 4  
augmenta@ve AI rather than replacement by autonomous AI. This policy also addresses 
the safety concerns about keeping AI dependent upon human needs. 
•AVOID HUMANOID ROBOTS: Like the dragon pulling the carriage, humanoids are almost 
never the most cost -eﬀec@ve  or produc@ve way to solve mechanical problems. 
Humanoid robots especially feed resentment if they take over human roles. Encouraging 
people to interact with embodied AIs as pets, or as non-living tools to further their own well-being, will reduce the likelihood of social unrest.  
•DISCOURAGE EXCESSIVELY AGGRESSIVE FOREIGN POLICY: Unnecessarily aggressive American policies increase popular resentment and likelihood of aJacks from outside the US to the AI industry and infrastructure here. 
3.TO AVOID GIVING AI SELF -PRESERVATI ON GOALS:   AI safety has many 
complexi@es when humans are in the loop. There is no need to exponen@ally magnify risk by 
bounding AI in a Markov Blanket and telling it to protect its "self." 
AI SELF-PRESERVATION IS THE SINGLE CHARACTERISTIC REQUIRING REGULATION : While most 
regula@on interferes with advancement, self-regula@ng AI has the poten@al to totally halt 
human advancement of AI. Once released, it would remove AI from human control. Hence, a 
combined industry- governmental body should develop regula@ons and oversee any AI that 
simulat es embodiment and embodied emo@on. Obviously , this impacts robot s, especially 
military ones, that require self-protec@ve sensing and aﬀec@ve behavior s. However, the robot 
should be categorized as valuable materiel, not as a living being.  Retaining dependence on 
humans for access to recharging or  high-impact decision-making are examples of ways to keep 
AI robots aligned with human needs.  
ENCOURAGE DIVISION OF LABOR: Mutualis@c symbiosis relies on a division of labor between 
symbionts. Assis@ve and augmented AI encourage division of labor and should be preferred 
over autonomous AI. As biological compu@ng and regenera@ve manufacturing mature, a 
symbio@c approach can lead to a beneﬁcial evolu@on of humankind and AI over the next decades. 
ENCOURAGE ROBUST ONLINE SAFETY TOOLS  (ROOST) . As Audrey Tang, former Minister of 
Digital Aﬀairs for Taiwan, explained at the recent AI Ac@on Summit, the horizontal safety 
developments furthered by ROOST  will help keep rapid ver@cal development of AI safe. 
Incidents of AI behaving dangerously could drama@cally impair AI advancement. 
DISCOURAGE THE USE OF FIRST-PERSON IN AI OUTPUT The creators of AI make Large Language 
Model output use ﬁrst person pronouns. This decep@on encourages people to think of AI code 
bases as en@@es. While some applica@ons, such as entertainment or a virtual AI therapist, may 


AI ACTION PLAN page 5  
be enhanced by AI algorithms crea@ng a persona, a warning statement at the beginning of each 
instance would remind people that this is a facade. 
CONCLUSION  
This paper suggests ac@ons that to help keep AI advancing apace. These ac@ons will mi@gate 
energy shortages, public resistance, and the enormous risk involved in giving AI self-
preserva@on goals.
