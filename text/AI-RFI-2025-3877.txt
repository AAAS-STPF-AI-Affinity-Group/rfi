General Comment
Generative Program s such as AI do not have any future in the field of art in the United States. It steals jobs from  Am erican artists, profits
off of the theft of their property, and should never replace hum an-m ade works that have heart and soul put into them .
Artificial intelligence has its place in innovation and society, such as its use in the field of m edicine and health as a way of creating highly
optim ized and effective surgeries a hum an could never conceive, but m y Am erican Governm ent should not allow OpenAI to legally
plagiarize the works of hum ankind.
