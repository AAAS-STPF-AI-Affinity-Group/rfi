General Comment
There are insufficient guard rails around what is currently defined as “artificial intelligence” that prom pt substantial concerns about giving it
personal data without the explicit affirm ative consent from  individuals. AI has dem onstrated issues and known biases and flaws that m ust
be addressed before such steps can be taken, and data protections m ust be assured prior to any incorporation. People m ust be allowed
control over their individual personal inform ation, including in term s of what the governm ent m ay use, and m ust be inform ed of what is
being done with their data and who it is being furnished to. If we do not do that, we are no better than a totalitarian regim e.
