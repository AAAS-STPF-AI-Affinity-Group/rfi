General Comment
My beliefs as an Am erican citizen that the right to work and not have said work be stolen from  m e and m y other individual creators
disregarding any intellectual property rights that AI steps over is abhorrent. This will only lead down to continue exploitative practices and
abuse of power through our econom y and governm ent. Not to m ention the addition of politically charged propaganda where AI altered
photos m ay be used to create falsified docum ents used to charge the innocent with unjust and unfair crim es punishing those who have
done nothing wrong, and further allowing our country to descend into facism . Do not let this pass for any reason.
