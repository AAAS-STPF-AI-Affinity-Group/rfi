General Comment
I am  strongly opposed to the developm ent of this AI action plan. It would be highly detrim ental to sm all businesses and artisans which I'm
confident the current adm inistration has little interest in, so to give you incentives you actually care about, AI is full of erroneous data. One
need sim ply look at the drastic decline in the quality of Google search results which are often full of factually incorrect info to see this is ill
advised.
Furtherm ore, pursuing AI would open up corporations looking to exploit trained data to their own copyrighted assets being exploited and
beyond this, consum ers trust AI based products less. Dogan Gursoy, the author of a study into AI products (see:
https://www.tandfonline.com /doi/full/10.1080/19368623.2024.2368040) said "In every single case, whenever we m entioned 'AI' vs 'high
tech', consum ers' purchase intention went down."
The White House site says "With the right governm ental policies, continued U.S. AI leadership will prom ote hum an flourishing, econom ic
com petitiveness, and national security." but the current adm inistration could not possibly be m ore poorly equipped to handle such
aspirations without negative consequence. As previously stated, consum ers often avoid AI based products, there is no econom ic
com petitiveness to be gained. & the idea of basing nat sec on AI is dangerously ludicrous.
AI search results have suggested m aking pizza with glue, eating rocks for nutritional health confusing satire for genuine advice, & m ixing
chlorine bleach with white vinegar in laundry which creates toxic gases. What dom inance could we possibly derive in nat sec from  system s
that can't tell the difference between legitim ate m edical advice and jokes posted by Reddit users?
All of this on top of Elon Musk chaotically stam peding through the United States governm ent like a blindfolded bull through a china shop
with incredibly obvious bias, this adm inistration is wholly incapable of scrutinizing/drafting AI policies with an intelligent & im partial eye.
In short, the inaccuracies in AI and ram pant distrust are far m ore likely to dam age econom ic com petitiveness and national security than
com e anywhere near prom oting "hum an flourishing".
