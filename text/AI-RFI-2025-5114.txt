General Comment
I believe, given the past half-decade of what AI technology has brought us, AI as an industry would be better off regulated. 'Burdensom e
regulation,' as m entioned in the docum ent, would im ply that the EO would seek to upend the very policies keeping the tech industry in
check and retaining organic labor in the econom y. If left unchecked, we could potentially see a rise in unem ploym ent and incom e disparity
if this all leads to com panies replacing its own organic labor with AI, as a lot of com panies would very likely see this as an opportunity to
m axim ize their profits. I've seen this happen left-and-right, especially with creatives which already struggle to find opportunity because
com panies would rather put som e words in a prom pt generator to m ake an AI-generated picture, m oving or not, so they wouldn't have to
pay their own workers for som e soulless inorganic slop. All I ask is for the governm ent to reconsider its stance on certain AI technologies
which are already doing m ore harm  than good in som e industries and take a m ore sensible approach. I believe part of Am erica's beauty is
in its organic workforce and I would like for it to stay that way.
