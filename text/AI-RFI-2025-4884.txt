General Comment
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public
This is a terrible idea. Copyrighted m aterial has laws and regulations around them , no am ount of "national security" should allow
com panies to steal content from  others hard work to train it to COPY from  what it has learned.
This is a dangerous gam e to play, and a precedent we shouldn't set.
