General Comment
Generative AI is nothing short of disastrous to the econom y, the environm ent, and the continued educational and cultural growth of
hum anity as a whole. Generative AI has proven to be costly with no real return on investm ent, and because of the way it has been touted
as the next great technological advancem ent, every industry has flocked to it to replace their seasoned em ployees to have the work done
at a lower cost, quality nonwithstanding. The server farm s require an incredible am ount of energy that puts a strain on our already strained
environm ent. It is using up our natural resources at an astounding rate to power these servers with no real benefit. Meanwhile, teachers
everywhere are com plaining that their students don’t know how to look up inform ation or write a report because they use AI to do
everything for them , and AI only gives accurate responses about 60% of the tim e. AI is a copyright disaster in all artistic fields, as it is
trained on individual artists’ works with no credit or rem uneration. AI should be heavily legislated against and restricted, as the continued
use of Generative AI is disastrous to our way of life as a species.
