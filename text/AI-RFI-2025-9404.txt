General Comment
AI is plagiarism , uses up unnecessary am ounts of our water and electricity, puts m oderators at great m ental risk, steals, prevents critical
thinking, supports m isinform ation disguised under "it's the com puter it isnt wrong." It is unnecessary and m aking our products and
experiences worse. It needs to be regulated for the safety of both our creatives who it is stealing from  and our ordinary people who are at
risk of its m isinform ation and dam age.
