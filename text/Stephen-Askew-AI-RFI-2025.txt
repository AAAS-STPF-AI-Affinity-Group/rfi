Hello,
After having read through the plan proposed, I firmly believe that generative AI does not hold a place in the USâ€™sfuture, especially if given minimal copyrighted restrictions.AI clearly breaks copyright law and takes away from the livelihood of everyone, regardless of whether or not theyuse AI. This includes myself. Much of the excitement around AI is greatly overblown; even now, a lot of the initialexcitement behind it has diminished.While AI does have some benefits, those benefits absolutely must fall in line with the laws we have established inorder for them to be effective.
