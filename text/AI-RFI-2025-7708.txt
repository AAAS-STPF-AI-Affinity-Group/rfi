General Comment
AI is horrible for the current situation we have. It give incorrect inform ation from  data scraping, google is a huge contributor to this. AI
steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the Am erican public / AI is a speculative
m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and huge legal problem s by enabling them . They also
use us so m uch water with their servers from  sooo m any people using them , theyâ€™re a huge environm ental disaster happening.
All in all. I HATE AI AND DO NOT BENEFIT FROM IT!!!!
