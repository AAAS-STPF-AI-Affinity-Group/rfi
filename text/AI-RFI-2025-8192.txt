General Comment
AI doesnâ€™t have a place in the future of the US
AI com panies should be held to the rules of the land and not get a special carve out for harm ing Am ericans and their works
AI is purely hype and ultim ately not
AI will never replace people and therefore has no place in the future of our people so should therefore be nixed entirely from  future plans
