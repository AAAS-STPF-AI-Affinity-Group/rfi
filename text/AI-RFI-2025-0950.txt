General Comment
All inform ation about AI (artificial intelligence) should be taken with a grain of salt. The gains that "AI" has m ade in recent years have been
m ild at best, and really only serve to drain the wallets of speculative investors, while the actual "AI" product provides no actual value
besides weak gim m icks. That all com bined with the fact that "AI" server farm s take an enorm ous am ount of energy from  our power grid,
while providing nothing of actual substance.
The use of the term  INTELLIGENCE in AI also im plies that these program s have intelligence, but truly, all AI does is re-word and re-
create inform ation that has been fed into it's algorithm s, this inform ation, which is com m only stolen from  actual hum an creators.
The current state of "AI" is nothing m ore than an autom atic thesaurus, copying work from  others the sam e way a lazy student would copy
the hom ework of their peers, providing nothing of value to the populace.
Instead of giving speculative "what-if" investing into "AI", that m oney should be going to im proving the wellbeing of the citizens of this great
nation, and the people of the world.
