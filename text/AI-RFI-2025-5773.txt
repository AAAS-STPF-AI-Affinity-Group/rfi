General Comment
I am  writing to express m y firm ly held belief that so-called "AI" com panies be restricted in the the data they can access and use in their
m odels. All data used m ust be com pensated and used in an opt-in m anner. To do otherwise is to steal from  hardworking Am ericans
whose creations enrich our lives every day.
