General Comment
This docum ent is approved for public dissem ination. The docum ent contains no business-proprietary or confidential inform ation.
Docum ent contents m ay be reused by the governm ent in developing the AI Action Plan and associated docum ents without attribution.
My nam e is Curi Lagann, I am  a freelance artist, and I oppose this plan with all of m y being. This plan is based on taking everything and
anyone's inform ation against the will of m ost people and organizations. The worst part is they do it without the victim s even knowing, this
bypasses everyone's right to keep their own inform ation, data, and hard work from  being stolen.
It's sickening how som ething like this is even up for debate, it's stom ping over every person's rights. My life's work, m y 30+ years of
blood sweat and tears learning a craft could be stolen, recreated, and used by giant corperations and governm ent just so they can use it in
grifts disguised as "the future". Sham e on anyone who thinks this is a good idea, the am ount of energy and dam age done to the envirom ent
in order to power these technologies is bad enough, but on top of that it necessitates theft on a scale not yet seen or understood by
hum ans.
Do not go through with this, do not let AI dictate what is and isn't ok to steal
