General Comment
I don't think you all quite understand how dangerous this notion is. This rem oves the defense for all artists - ALL - against AI stealing
there work, and legitam izes excessive tracing and selling of said work as if it was their own.
We shouldn't just be focusing on AI, we should be allowing all fields, equally, to flourish. This m akes AI an excessively dom ineering force
in the m arket of art, m usic, and every m edia-related banner, rem oving our right as hum ans (and am ericans) to sell and prom ote things we
m ade ourselves, with our hands.
This not only puts m illions of am erican artists, m usicians, photographers, you nam e it in financial risk, but stym es growth in those fields for
everyone who isin't using AI. It is a fact AI m akes art cheaper and faster, and we shouldn't be selling shoddy products to the world. That
deligtam izes us.
