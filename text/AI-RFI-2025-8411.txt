General Comment
It is deep ly ironic how draco nian cop yright law has beco me for the average citizen. We are n't allowed to use a scrap of cop yrighted music 
or video for anything we make, no matter how tra nsformative and legally viable it is. Huge companies crush creat ivity and squeeze us for 
ad pen nies because someone put 5 seconds of a song in their YouTube video. But now they want immunity to *steal our own 
copyri ghted material from us*! The answer is No. Absolutely not. Take a short walk off a long bridge. Shove it so far up your a&^ 
that your money-grubbi ng fist bursts throu gh your swol len, fetid mouth. Gen AI is a worthless tech nology that no one wants, sucki ng 
up all the world's  electricity and accelerati ng green house gas em issions into the atm osphere sm ack in the middle of a cl imate crisis, 
for what? A stupid app  bloati ng up my phone with adware that I'm just going to turn of f? Get lost. YOU. CANNOT. HAV E. OUR. 
ART.
