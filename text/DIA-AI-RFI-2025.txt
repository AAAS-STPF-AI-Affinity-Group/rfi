 3 I. Executive Summary 
i. Overview  
Artificial intelligence stands as a cornerstone of American leadership in the 21st century, promising to enhance human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security as 
outlined in Executive Order 14179 (January 23, 2025). The Trump Administration’s revocation 
of burdensome regulations under EO 14110 and its call for an AI Action Plan signal a pivotal 
shift toward unleashing private sector innovation. This white paper responds to the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) solicitation by addressing critical AI policy topics and proposing actionable policies to solidify U.S. dominance, guided by economic and security 
imperatives. Current AI challenges, such as resource-intensive models, security vulnerabilities, 
and workforce inefficiencies, demand solutions that are compute -efficient, secure, and scalable. 
The recommendations herein reflect a vision for responsible AI that empowers federal agen cies 
and the private sector alike, ensuring America leads without ideological overreach, engineered 
social agendas, or unnecessary bureaucracy.

iii. Policy Recommendations  
The following policies align with the president’s ‘National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan’ as well as the White House’s ‘Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights’.  
– Accelerate workforce efficiency with rapid -deployment AI.  
– Mandate compute-efficient AI standards for sustainability.  
– Enhance open-source utility with secure hybrid frameworks.  
– Strengthen cybersecurity with sovereign AI deployments.  
– Safeguard data privacy with pretrained, no -training AI.  
– Streamline governance with flexible, transparent standards.  

 
 4 II. Application and Use 
Federal agencies and private enterprises increasingly rely on AI to streamline operations and 
enhance decision-making, yet many solutions fail to integrate seamlessly with existing 
workflows or adapt to dynamic needs. Knowledge friction, delays in accessing critical 
information, plagues workforces, particularly as employee turnover rises and documentation 
sprawls across decentralized systems. Existing AI applications often prioritize novelty over 
practicality, leaving users with tools that are slow to deploy or misaligned with real-world 
demands, risking the safe and effective systems  principle from the Blueprint for an AI Bill of 
Rights. 
 
The future lies in AI systems that deliver immediate, attributable answers from trusted sources, 
reducing onboarding time and augmenting human capabilities. Such tools should span data silos, 
integrate with platforms like SharePoint or ServiceNow, and supp ort multimodal content e.g., 
handwritten notes, embedded images , to maximize utility across sectors. These systems must 
provide Notice and Explanation, clear documentation of their function and impact, ensuring 
users understand how automation affects them. This approach aligns with the Select Committee 
on Artificial Intelligence’s Strategy 2, human-AI collaboration, and Strategy 7, workforce 
readiness, while meeting the Blueprint’s call for unified access to critical resources. 
 III. Energy Consumption and Efficiency 
The AI boom has driven an insatiable demand for compute power, straining energy resources 
and inflating costs. Traditional large language models (LLMs), with their massive parameter 
counts, consume excessive energy for training and inference, posing sustai nability challenges for 
data centers and edge deployments alike. This inefficiency hampers scalability and burdens federal budgets, undermining economic competitiveness and risking unsafe outcomes contrary to 
a safe and effective systems principle. 
 
Lightweight, compute-efficient AI models that achieve high accuracy with minimal resource 
demands are essential. Solutions that reduce LLM size by orders of magnitude, while 
maintaining performance and undergoing pre-deployment testing offer a path to sustainable 
innovation. This approach aligns with the Select Committee’s Strategy 1 , long-term investment 
in responsible AI, and EO 14179’s barrier-removal ethos, ensuring systems are both effective and environmentally responsible. 
 
IV. Open-Source Development 
Open-source AI has fueled rapid advancements, but it often comes with trade -offs: lack of 
enterprise-grade security, inconsistent performance, and reliance on fragmented toolsets requiring extensive customization. Federal adoption lags as open -source solutions struggle to 
meet stringent compliance needs e.g., IL5/IL6, leaving agencies dependent on costly bespoke development. 
 
A hybrid approach, combining open-source flexibility with proprietary optimizations, can 
accelerate deployment while ensuring reliability. Pretrained, no -training-required models that 
integrate with existing infrastructure and undergo independent evaluatio n bridge this gap. This 
aligns with the Select Committee’s Strategy 8 , public-private partnerships, and the Blueprint’s 
emphasis on proactive risk mitigation, transitioning innovations into practical, safe use.  

 
 5 V. Cybersecurity 
AI systems remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, data breaches, and supply chain risks, 
particularly when reliant on external APIs or cloud -hosted models. Federal cybersecurity 
standards (e.g., NIST 800-53) demand robust protections, yet many commercial offerings fall short, exposing sensitive operations to exploitation. The proliferation of generative AI amplifies 
risks like hallucination and misinformation . 
 Secure AI must operate within firewalls, eliminate external dependencies, and incorporate role -
based access controls (RBAC). Systems designed for on-premises or air-gapped deployment, with pre-vetted connectors and continuous monitoring can meet these need s. This approach 
aligns with the Select Committee’s Strategy 4 , safety and security, and EO 14179’s national 
security focus, ensuring AI safeguards civil liberties and critical operations.  
 VI. Data Privacy and Lifecycle Security 
Data privacy concerns loom large as AI systems ingest vast datasets, often training on customer 
data and risking leakage or reverse-engineering. Lifecycle security, from development to 
deployment, is inconsistent, with many solutions lacking granular acces s controls or auditability. 
This erodes trust and compliance with federal mandates, conflicting with the Blueprint’s Data 
Privacy principle, which demands built-in protections and user agency. 
 
AI platforms that never train on customer data, maintain read -only access to repositories, and log 
every transaction for governance offer a solution. Such systems, designed with privacy -by-
default features and enhanced protections for sensitive domains e.g ., health, education, ensure 
privacy and security throughout their lifecycle. This aligns with the Select Committee’s Strategy 3, ethical and legal implications , and EO 14179’s emphasis on sovereignty. 
 VII. Risks, Regulation, and Governance 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Artificial Intelligence Risk Management 
Framework (AI RMF 1.0) highlights that AI’s rapid evolution outpaces regulatory frameworks, 
leading to inconsistent standards. Risks like bias, hallucination, and unintended outputs persist, 
while overregulation, such as the repealed EO 14110, stifles innovation. Governance str uggles to 
balance accountability with agility, particularly in federal contexts requiring transparency and compliance, echoing the Blueprint’s call for Algorithmic Discrimination Protections  and Human 
Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback . 
 
Flexible, risk-mitigating AI frameworks that ground responses in authoritative content, provide 
dashboards for usage oversight, and ensure human escalation options can address these 
challenges. Lightweight regulation that encourages innovation while enforcing security  and 
accuracy via proactive disparity testing and plain language reporting  aligns with the Select 
Committee’s Strategy 6, standards and benchmarks, and EO 14179’s deregulatory stance. 
 
VIII. Policy Recommendations 
The following policy actions address the current state of AI and position the U.S. as the global 
leader, integrating the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights  to ensure responsible innovation: 
1. Accelerate Workforce Efficiency with Rapid -Deployment AI
