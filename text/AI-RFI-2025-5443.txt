General Comment
AI is nothing but vague prom ises that som ething that has no actual use to the com m on person will m iraculously becom e the m ost im portant
thing ever and create all the m oney possible if it's sim ply allowed to break the law. If any other industry cam e crawling to the governm ent
and begged for this kind of special treatm ent it would be laughed out of the room  and given a kick in the butt for its troubles. AI is a
com plete fad industry that silicone valley will drop in three years if even then and I will not stand for it to be given these exem ptions from
the law because it prom ises everything while having delivered nothing for over a year. Do not give AI exem ption from  copyright law. It
should have to pay for using other people's works just like film s pay actors and anim ators.
