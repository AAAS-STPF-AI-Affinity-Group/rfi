General Comment
Hum ans will forever be m ore creative and freer-thinking than AI will ever be. AI does not hold a place in the future of our country, and it
would be utterly dam aging to hum anity to allow it to grow in the way that it has been. It profits off of theft and hurts the livelihood of
hum ans who deserve to celebrate their own intelligence.
