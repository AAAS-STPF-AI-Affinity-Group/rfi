General Comment
I see that this request for inform ation seeks to elim inate "unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents" from  private sector AI innovation. I find
this perfectly ridiculous. 
Do NOT allow AI to use copyrighted works without levying the appropriate fees. Even libraries, with all the leniecies given to them  in the
nam e of free use, cannot rem ix and distribute copyrighted works without significant lim itations and costs. Why should generative AI slop
m achines be allowed to m aterially benefit off of work it does not own, just because it uses a volum e of copyrighted works beyond the
realm  of hum an im agination? Frankly that m akes it worse. 
AI and its private owners are bound to the law the sam e as anyone else. Copyright infringem ent is copyright infringem ent-- particularly
when used for com m ercial ends. Don't let the AI bubble industry break the law just to m ake a quick buck.
