General Comment
A com pletely foolish idea. Giving AI com panies free reign to train on stolen data and shielding them  from  any punishm ent for doing so is
disgusting. All of the AI com panies are full of thieves, swindlers and crooks. AI like this should have no place in the governm ent of the
US, but really not anywhere at all considering it sucks so bad. It's a scam  that's burning up what's left of the environm ent, to m ake
products off of STOLEN data that aren't even good, on top of threatening the livelihood of Am ericans like m yself. Only som eone as
foolish as the goons who are currently steering the ship that is our country would think this a good idea, being them selves thieves,
swindlers and crooks. I strongly encourage anyone who's left with a m odicum  of sense and a spine to stand up and not let this happen.
