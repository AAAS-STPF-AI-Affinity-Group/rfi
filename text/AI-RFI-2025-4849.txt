General Comment
I do not believe we should rem ove the proposed guardrails that lim it the developm ent of AI, as the requested concessions constitute theft
from  m yself and all of our creations. AI does not present value for our nation and the theft of our work to m ake a handful of com panies
wealthy is outrageous.
