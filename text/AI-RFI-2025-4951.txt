General Comment
I don't believe AI has a place in the future of Am erica. The m ain function of AI is to collect inform ation, shred it apart, and regurgitate it in
a lesser or worse form  with little regards to factual inform ation, or who owns the original works that was put into the algorithm s.
AI by how its designed can't have an original thought, its can't com e up with new ideas, and it can't see the weaknesses in its own
functions. Only hum an thought and knowledge can do these things. And shoving them  all in a learning m achine, just for it to spit out
lackluster, flawed ideas or projects, does a disservice to every Am erican it learns off of.
There's no am ount of tim e or m oney you can put into AI for it to be better than the hum an ability of thought and reason
And this is putting aside that a lot of AI up to this point has had a lot if its data be used without creators' perm ission. Which is theft no
m atter which way you cut it.
