General Comment
By opening the floodgates for artificial intelligence to "m ake art", you are begging to be given a lawsuit by every m ajor corporation. They
will fight for their copyright protections, losing you m ore m oney than it's worth im plem enting this.
Alongside that, the United States is known worldwide for exporting its m edia to other countries. Allowing for this is tantam ount to giving
that away in exchange for allowing a constant stream  of slop nobody will watch. People prefer art that is m ade by people, not stolen by
bots.
