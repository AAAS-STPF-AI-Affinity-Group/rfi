General Comment
The whole planet is covered in plastic garbage and that's what AI is going to do to our digital environm ent in a shockingly short am ount of
tim e. And people spend a lot of tim e online. Polluting social m edia and the internet is going to have a negative effect on people that will
spill over into the real world. Burying everything useful on the internet in a bunch of fake garbage is going to drive people insane. How
m uch tim e does the average Am erican child spend connected to the internet? What's the upside here? The chance to destroy art as a
viable career for future generations? Seem s bad.
