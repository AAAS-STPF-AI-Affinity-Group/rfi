White House AI Action Plan
White House AI Action Plan-1

Re: National Science Foundation’s Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
I am an everyday American who has spent decades working hard studying design, illustration, 
and animation t o hopefully make a name for myself, but recent breakthroughs in AI threaten to 
jeopardize my ability to ever break into the already hypercompetitive industries. 
The AI systems made by Big Tech companies like OpenAI (Microsoft) and Google 
threaten to destroy thousands of American small businesses with their recent demand to 
create special carve outs in copyright law. 
AI system s can only be produced by first training on work made by people. My unique work, and 
the work of hundreds of thousands of other everyday American creators was taken and fed into 
these AI systems without our consent or any compensation. They ingest our work, reassemble 
it, and then sell it back to our clients – directly and unfairly competing with us, and also cutting 
us out of the marketplace. 
Now these Big Tech companies are asking this administration to create exceptions and 
loopholes to make this practice of stealing American creators’ copyrighted work legal precedent. 
They are suggesting that if a machine ingests and reproduces copyrighted work, it is somehow 
suddenly “fair use”.  
They seem to believe that anything and everything on the internet – regardless of who owns it – 
should be theirs for the taking. They claim that if this administration does not allow them to 
rewrite the law in this way, it will stifle American innovation. 
Instead, it will have the opposite effect. The purpose of American copyright law is to 
protect the incentive to create and innovate. AI under current regulations threatens to 
terminate that incentive. 
If we the American people do not own our creations, and everything we put online will be stolen 
by Big Tech giants, what will be the incentive to create? If everyday Americans create a new 
innovative piece of computer code, a new visual design, or a new piece of music only to have it 
immediately stolen by Google and Microsoft, why bother creating it in the first place? How will 
anyone possibly make a living doing these things? 
In order to protect American innovation, you must protect American creators. Do no t create 
new copyright exemptions that allow Big Tech companies to exploit and steal from 
creators and everyday Americans without permission, compensation, or transparency. 


 
This administration’s AI Action Plan should focus not on giving away creator content to Big Tech 
companies, but rather on ensuring a fair marketplace with competition: 
 ● First, the government should ensure that creators and everyday Americans give effective 
consent, so that we can decide when and where our work is used by AI systems. 
 
● Second, the AI Action Plan should encourage a robust licensing marketplace, so that 
the incentive to create for small businesses is preserved. Our work has immense 
economic value, so the value generated by that work should accrue to the original 
creators, not just Big Tech.  
● Finally, the AI Action Plan should require transparency from Big Tech companies, 
requiring them to disclose what material is in their training datasets, and label what 
content is AI generated.  
I am not entirely anti-AI, or anti-technology. I believe these new breakthroughs can still find a 
proper place in the modern world, but as tools for human creators, not a replacement. We 
should not sacrifice the hard work of hundreds of thousands of Americans and give it away to 
Big Tech by rewriting copyright law. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on these important issues.
