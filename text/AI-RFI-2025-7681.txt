General Comment
This is a useless last ditch effort to deregulate a series of over leveraged and bloated tech com panies that have already been beaten to the
punch by a foreign adversary in order to give them  political cover to continue to scrape public data for their own gain. It will not benefit
the Am erica people but m ore accurately a few dozen tech executives and their shareholders. It should not becom e policy.
