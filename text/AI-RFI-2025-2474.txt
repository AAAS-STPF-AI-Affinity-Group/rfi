General Comment
Artificial intelligence is built on the principle of stealing other's creative works and m eshing them  into one giant plagiarized project. I will not
stand for this breach on creative works and I ask you kindly to reconsider your decisions. There is no heart, nor soul in the idea of theft.
After all, the thief's goal is to kill and destroy, is it not? A.I. is said thief in this case. It's killing the creativity hum anity once birthed since its
inception. When everything becom es com puter-generated, nothing will have hum an thought or creativity anym ore. It will all be the sam e.
