AI will only lead to wasteful spending on not only tax payers but anyone who steps foot in the 
US and it's territories. It is a waste of everyone's time and money, and has absolutely no benefit to anyone. It will only give biased or completely wrong information as it is an unreliable source and should be nowhere nea r any official position. It will only harm America and our Allies, 
because that is what Gen AI does, it will use our Natural resources faster, making us (government and citizen alike) spend more especially with the tariffs that are being put on other count ries. To restate, This will never help any citizen and will only harm them, if Republicans 
truly care about us (citizens) then this should be stricken down and never looked at again.
