General Comment
AI steals the work of artists by scraping the data from  their art in order to train itself. This does not just affect independent artists; this also
affects the art of m ajor com panies (i.e. Disney, Marvel, etc.) and will m ake it harder for them  to prosecute copyright infringem ent as well.
AI should be used to m ake m enial tasks obsolete so hum ans can create m ore art, not be used to create art so hum ans can do m ore m enial
tasks.
