General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
AI is a terrible way for corporate Am erica to cut back on its hours and pay wages to further increase the profits of the rich and elite.
Unless you also plan to find a way to m ake this country m ore affordable to live in including healthcare, housing, and basic necessities. You
in no way should be developing an AI system  that is ultim ately going to leave m ore Am ericans struggling in their every day lives.
