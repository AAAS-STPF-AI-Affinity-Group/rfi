General Comment
AI does not have a place in the future of Am erica. It is m erely hype with nothing real behind it. AI can never replace real hum an
intelligence or creativity. Furtherm ore, you CANNOT allow AI to bypass copyright restrictions to train on the works of real artists. This
is, as I see it, an affront to hum anity and to art itself. Artists deserve to have their work protected, not fed into a m achine that spits out a
lesser copy. Allowing AI com panies to bypass copyright restrictions would be truly disgusting and an insult to everyone who has ever
honestly produced art.
