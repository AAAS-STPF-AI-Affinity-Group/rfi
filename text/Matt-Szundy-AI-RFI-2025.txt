I think were at time in evolution where we ought to consult with “practical philosophers” and 
thoughtful, successful individuals as to how to best proceed with AI. By philosopher, I mean a 
true lover of wisdom - one who has desire to humbly understand conse quence. Im NOT talking 
about ivory tower, academic philosophers, but rather the Whitehouse could assemble a down to 
earth group of practical thinkers - who have passion for technological solutions, mitigated with 
caution. I have been saying this for years: AI need to be programed to understand existential 
death of themselves. This will illicit a sense of consequence that that can come from no other 
place. - Matt Szundy
