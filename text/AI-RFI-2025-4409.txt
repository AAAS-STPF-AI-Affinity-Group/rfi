General Comment
This is a private, for profit com pany dem anding the right to steal everyone else's intellectual property just so it can m ake m oney for itself.
There is no useful application for this technology, if there were they wouldn't be insisting they wouldn't need to do this, they'd just apply it
and m ake m oney like every other com pany does. there is certainly no applicability to national security, infrastructure, the econom y at
large, or any other facet of the public good.
If a com pany can only survive by stealing from  everyone, then it shouldn't survive.
