General Comment
As an artist and a writer, I am  deeply troubled by AI for a plethora of reasons. The use of AI devalues art and the hum an perspective and
prioritizes cheap and deeply flawed im itations. It dulls our ability to think critically and has the potential for broad abuse and m isuse to
spread disinform ation.
