General Comment
Creative individuals rely on strong copyright protections to m aintain the value and integrity of their work. Allowing AI m odels to be trained
on copyrighted works com pletely underm ines these protections and threatens the livelihood of all creative workers. It m ust not be m ade
perm issible to train AI on creative works without the EXPLICIT perm ission of the individual copyright holder.
