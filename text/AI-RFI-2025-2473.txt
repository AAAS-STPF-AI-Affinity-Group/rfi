General Comment
This is a horrible step to m ake in regards to livelihoods, the econom y, and jobs. It will put thousands, if not m illions in danger. Even those
not directly involved in AI training will be affected. It will cost several lives even.
I strongly urge that this step does not pass for the sake of Am erican lives.
