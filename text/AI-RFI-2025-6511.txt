General Comment
I absolutely do not support the rem oval of safeguards on AI nor do I support the speed at which the Executive Office is m oving to institute
such policies. The rem oval of regulation on such pivotal software m odels only serves to both build flawed future m odels while also not
protecting the m ost vulnerable in society.
