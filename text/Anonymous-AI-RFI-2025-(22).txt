The USA does not need to be the leader of a technology that only functions through infinite 
amounts of theft and copyright infringement, massive use of water, and billions of dollars to keep the stupid things running. Nevermind the electricity needed for t hem to run in the first 
place. That money and energy could be put into more important things like our roads, infrastructure, education, and housing, which would all create a healthier and better workforce. AI will not promote any of the things this initiative claims to do (human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security). It compromises those things entirely. AI hallucinates data. It isn't intelligent. The only thing the support of AI will do is take away American jobs, render thousands of people homeless, and thus, dead. That doesn't sound like flourishing to me. People are already losing jobs to AI after their bosses fed their work to AI without their consent. The ability to, without any consent given or prior warning, one can be rendere d irrelevant like 
that without another dime to spare for work they contributed, is an extremely dangerous one. And it will be relentlessly abused unless protections are put in place.
