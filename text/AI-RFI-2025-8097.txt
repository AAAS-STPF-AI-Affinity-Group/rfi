General Comment
Unpaid AI training is plagiarism . These interests are supported by alm ost unm atched speculative capital, and yet they dem and the right to
plagiarize the country's (and the world's) artists with no com pensation.
It is an unthinkable precedent to set, that even som e of the m ost skilled workers will have no defense against their work being stolen
without pay.
These com panies can easily afford to purchase works from  artists, should they want. If the governm ent gave away the right to
corporations to take m illions of hours of labor for no pay in any other industry, it would be slavery. The only difference in this case is
perspective.
