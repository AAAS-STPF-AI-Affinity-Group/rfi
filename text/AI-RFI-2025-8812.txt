General Comment
AI technologies were developed through the theft of intellectual property. To allow the unfettered developm ent of AI without intense
oversight, regulation, and ethical guardrails would add peril to injury. 
The environm ental and hum an cost of AI, both now and in the future, necessitates responsible governm ent oversightâ€” not a corrupt
power-grab.
