General Comment
Generative AI, as it exists currently, can only be explained as a ram pant "plagiarism  m achine." A m achine that steals, copies, and
regurgitates ideas, im ages, and text that are presented to it. It does not give credit to the artists it takes from , and it does not even yield a
sustainable product, m uch less a quality product. Im ages and other products created by current Generative AI is subpar in m any respects.
Im ages have too m any fingers, eyes are unfocused, m etal m elds with wood. Beyond the sim ple shoddy nature of these "products," this
also takes REAL work, m oney, and tim e away from  authors, artists, and other creatives, that can be m aking revenue and stim ulating the
econom y, whereas Generative AI has exorbitant energy costs that so far have ONLY outweighed its supposed usefulness. Vote for the
econom y and vote AGAINST Generative AI.
