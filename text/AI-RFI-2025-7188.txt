General Comment
This is the situation that science fiction stories have warned us about for decades. Do not allow AI com panies to steal unim peded from
hum an creators. AI is ruining m ultiple industries, Microsoft itself perform ed a study that proved it was destroying our brains and ability to
think critically, and we should not allow tech com panies to continue to tram ple real hum an creativity in the nam e of profit. This is a
dangerous precedent to set and I wholeheartedly encourage our governm ent to block any further theft from  AI com panies.
