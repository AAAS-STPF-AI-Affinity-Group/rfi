General Comment
Do not let OpenAI use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI, that is theft. I don't think AI has a place in the future of the U.S but rather
that it is an exploitable threat. It steals jobs, it steals m aterial, and it consum es a needlessly excessive am ount energy. Again, it steals from
the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off theft. You cannot possibly support that.
