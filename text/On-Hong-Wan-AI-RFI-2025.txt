Good evening.
I have nothing more to say except that AI should not be strengthened but instead further
regulated and even reduced. Too many Americans are already losing their jobs and livelihoodsto AI, with even more to come. It already is a gigantic central point of knowledge as well thatpresents a gigantic national security risk should it be hacked, and the methods of AI violateevery privacy or plagiarism ruling that exists. This bill must NOT pass.
Thank you for your time.
