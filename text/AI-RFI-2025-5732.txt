General Comment
The training of LLMs or other AI m odels m ust not be allowed to violate copyright sim ply because "if we needed to pay to license all of
this m aterial, we couldn't stay in business." A com pany that cannot afford to pay for the raw m aterials it needs in order to exist need not
exist, and "stealing these m aterials because we cannot pay for them " is essentially a crim inal enterprise. We've seen num erous exam ples of
AI com panies licensing content on the internet (e.g. OpenAI is paying Reddit for the use of their web content as its corpus) so com panies
should never receive a pass for effectively pirating content in the pursuit of "training AI". This is essentially "robbing Peter to pay Paul" and
the entire creative enterprise of hum anity is m ore valuable than whatever nebulous value AI would bring in the future.
