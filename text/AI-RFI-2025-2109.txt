General Comment
Like NFTs and "the m etaverse" before them , LLMs and GenAI are another worthless big tech grift. The current adm inistration knows it,
and everyone knows you know it. These m inisform ation vom it m achines are creating a bubble that will burst, likely to hilarious econom ic
consequences for the very sam e corporations pushing them  upon the m asses. Additionally, though these things can't reliably replace hum an
em ployees, m any Am ericans have lost jobs to AI already. This will only get worse without strict regulations on how com panies are
perm itted to use AI. If I'm  wrong, and it actually is a profitable technology fit to replace hum an workers, then how about you buck up and
provide Am ericans who lose their jobs with universal basic incom e, using the surplus profit generated by AI. Otherwise, tell Elon and his
buddies to quit trying to scam  us.
