General Comment
AI is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and huge legal problem s by enabling
them . It is stealing from  the livelihood of Am ericans, and should under no circum stances be encouraged to do so even m ore easily by
m aking it im m une to the regulations that it already heartily ignores.
AI needs to be m ore controlled, not less so. Investing in it is a m istake that will set Am erica back further. Nothing can replace the
innovation of a hum an m ind, and relying on AI to do so is relying on ideas that already exist, not new ones. AI cannot, and will never,
further our understanding of a single subject. All it will ever be able to do is m ore efficiently draw incorrect conclusions that will have to be
reviewed by som eone that could have just done the work itself. "AI" does not think. "AI" is a buzzword that continues to fool the
Am erican public. "AI" is theft.
Nvidia’s $600B m arket cap drop was not an accident, AI is a speculative bubble waiting to pop. (It’s like Nortel!)
