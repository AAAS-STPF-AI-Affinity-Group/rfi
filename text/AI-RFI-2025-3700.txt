General Comment
I am  asking you to not let OpenAI to use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI. It is theft and should be treated as such. AI has no place in
the future of the US—in fact, it will only m ake things worse. It steals jobs, it takes up precious resources, and consum es so m uch energy.
All generative AI and sim ilar things do is ruin what m akes the US good—it’s opportunity and resources, the things that people and
countries look up to the US for. It does nothing but hurt national security, too, when it’s expected to m anage sensitive sectors. You cannot
possibly want to side with som ething that is blatant theft and an irreversible act that can ruin the integrity of the entire nation.
Please stop OpenAI from  doing this. No one wants this. No one wants to support theft. No one wants to so blatantly steal the jobs of
hard working and honest Am ericans. No one wants to be a part of taking up resources and doing even worse things for the environm ent.
And I hope you don’t either, and instead choose to STOP THIS and—even better—BAN the use of generative AI in ANY
GOVERNMENT CAPACITY, hopefully even ban it on a NATIONAL level.
