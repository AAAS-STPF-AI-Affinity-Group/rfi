General Comment
AI is theft. Full stop. It is a lazy person's way of doing a job they have not trained, nor understand how, to do. And the only people who
keep pushing it are people who sit around doing shareholder m eetings. Maybe they should learn a skill rather than steal it from  us who
learned how to perform . No to AI.
