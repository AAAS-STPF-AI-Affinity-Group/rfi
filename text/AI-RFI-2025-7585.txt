General Comment
Generative AI has no place in governm ent functioning, nor anywhere else except a curiosity. Generative AI does not "think," it is
essentially a slightly m ore sophisticated form  of predictive text in your phone keyboard, and should not be trusted to provide anything
m ore com plex than a joke. All current gen AI was built by stealing content from  people who did NOT agree to have their work utilized
for other people to m ake m oney from  in boom -bust vulture capitalism  m arkets. Gen AI steals the livelihoods of US citizens in nearly every
creative field and in num erous other fields as well. It is sim ply a flash-in-the-pan tech-bro obsession of the day that will collapse just as
quickly as its predecessors like NFTs did before it, and circum venting our current laws to m ake exceptions for it would be an insane and
ill-advised course of action that would be looked on historically as a joke.
