General Comment
As a soon to be Com puter Science graduate I can say that AI has destroyed m y future as there arenâ€™t any jobs in m y field anym ore and
the facts point at AI com pletely replacing us soon. Besides that it is highly unfair to creatives that this m odels are being trained on their
work without their consent . If the governm ent cares so m uch about protecting the interests of corporations ,then they should show the
sam e em pathy towards their citizens . AI and com panies pushing it m ust be regulated, and copyright m ust be protected.
