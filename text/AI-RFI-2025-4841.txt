General Comment
It is a horrible idea to give OpenAI and other such glorified content scrapers free reign to steal copyrighted m aterial to train their useless
AI program s. It does not fall under fair use and it is a gross overreach of copyright law and legal precedent if this change were to take
place. It also threatens the livelihoods of people across vast swathes of the econom y, which is already teetering due to the Trum p
adm inistrationâ€™s prior horrendous econom ic policy and personnel decisions. Reconsider this.
