General Comment
AI, and technologies purporting to be AI, m ust be developed carefully and with attention to consequences for any choices m ade now.
Especially im portant at this stage are ensuring that all creators of existing works are given the chance to opt in or out of having their
intellectual property included in training m odels, considerations about resource use (especially power and water) to support the com pute,
false narratives and hype regarding the sophistication of particular m odels, the effects of culling harm ful m aterials on the people doing such
work, and consequences of believing technologies can m ake decisions that require a hum an m ind.
