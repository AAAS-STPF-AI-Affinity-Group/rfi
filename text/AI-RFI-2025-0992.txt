General Comment
One barrier to Am erican leadership in AI that I foresee is a population that has no idea how it works but still believes everything it says.
This plan should include an education aspect. If not directly funded with federal dollars, the adm inistration should do as m uch as possible
to incentivize states to educate our children on how AI works. Bring in experts. Develop a curriculum  that breaks things like large
language m odels and neural networks down to term s sim ple enough for first-graders to understand. This needs to be learned well before
college and m aybe even before high school.
High schools used to have auto-shop as a class. Kids would graduate knowing the basics of how their car works and how to m aintain it.
Back then, a car was a dangerous thing in the hands of a high-school kid until they knew how to use it. AI needs to be treated in a sim ilar
m anner. I'd say it's an even m ore dangerous thing to a 13 year old with an iPhone unless they understand how the inform ation they receive
from  AI is being generated.
It's one im portant aspect to build out infrastructure and concentrated industry expertise now, but if a generation of Am erican kids grow
into that infrastructure and aren't educated on at least the basics then it won't be "Am erican Leadership" in AI... it will be "A few Am erican
corporations and their cronies" leading AI.
