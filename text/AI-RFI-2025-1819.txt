General Comment
As a cybersecurity m ajor m yself, AI regulations are a m ust when people use their devices on a daily basis. These regulations protect
people from  predatory AI behavior, such as being used to harvest m ore data than what is stated on privacy policies for the sake of 'AI.'
Despite this, we've seen m ultiple apps incorporate AI using data in ways unstated in the privacy policy of the app itself (Discord,
Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Executive Order 14110 should have its wording im proved to be m ore concise and specific about its own
regulations, as rem oving them  can put the public at risk of larger com panies harvesting data with AI as an excuse.
