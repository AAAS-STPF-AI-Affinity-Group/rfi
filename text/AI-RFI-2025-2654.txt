General Comment
From  m y perspective, generative AI as it is progressing has no place in The United States. It is a violation to Am erican rights to their own
intellectual property, and allows foreign actors to spread m isinform ation m uch m ore easily. I believe generative AI WILL harm  Am erican
people if it is allowed to profress without lim itations.
