General Comment
I dislike this action plan solely because of Google having too m uch power to be able to use AI to censor publishers it doesn't coincide
with its values. This is an extrem e conflict of interest for those who are enacting their right for freedom  of speech. Secondly, having AI
train on intellectual property and having dim inished copyright laws is a detrim ent to all com panies and sm all creators businesses as it will
create endlessly confusing brands for any third-party. Even China has copyright laws and we should m aintain ours. I am  overall against this
plan and there are better ways to im prove this technology without dim inishing our intellectual property rights.
