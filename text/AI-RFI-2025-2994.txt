General Comment
I am  a writer, and AI represents an existential threat to m y livelihood. I've already been dism issed from  one job, not because of a lack of
perform ance, but because m y em ployer decided using ChatGPT was cheaper than paying a hum an being.
AI will destroy the workforce and put m illions out of work, while sim ultaneously leading to a glut of inaccurate, low-quality content and
inform ation.
