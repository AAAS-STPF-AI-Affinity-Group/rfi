General Comment
Giving these com panies a way to legally scrape inform ation that doesn't belong to them  opens an extrem ely dangerous precedent. This
doesn't just hurt artists that take tim e and effort on their work. This can also open other com panies to problem s too. If OpenAI does this
it's going to hurt every single public facing com pany or creator.
