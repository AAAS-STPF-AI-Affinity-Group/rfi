General Comment
Artificial Intelligence on a grand scale will only do m ore harm  than good for this planet. We will speed up global warm ing and m ake the
world a worse place for our children and those who already live here. It will be nothing but a hassle as no one can work, and we will all
be out of house and hom e due to corporate GREED and nothing m ore. Do not let this in, Do no let AI take over our planet and drain our
only hom e we have in this galaxy.
