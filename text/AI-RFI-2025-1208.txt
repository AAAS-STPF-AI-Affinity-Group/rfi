General Comment
Tech com panies should have to pay to license the data they train on. They have the m eans and the m oney to do so. A num ber of
com panies have already struck deals so the proposal that it’s too expensive an option is false. They essentially are afraid of being
inconvenienced not disadvantaged. Let’s not let the these com panies get lazy and destroy entire econom ic ecosystem s on prom ises they
m ay not even be able to fulfill. Keep in m ind, people like Sam  Altm an don’t have to live with their m istakes. The rest of us do. Don’t let
Silicon Valley determ ine what other people’s property should be used for.
