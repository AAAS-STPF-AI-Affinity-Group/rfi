To whom it may concern,
I am greatly concerned about the growth and spread of Artificial Intelligence with respect to
the arts.
As a musician and composer, it threatens my future and livelihood.  I do not see any benefit to
the arts nor does it bode well for human creativity.  It cannot cry or rage, only mimic.
The energy and resource consumption is also unsustainable.Do not steal from true creators.“This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-
