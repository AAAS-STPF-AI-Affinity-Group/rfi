General Comment
My nam e is Scott Kolp, and I am  a writer from  Studio City, CA. I’m  writing to express m y firm  conviction that any executive action
regarding artificial intelligence should safeguard the culture of innovation that has m ade Am erica great. Am erican creators of all stripes —
from  scientists to painters — are able to be the best in the world because of their access to free m arkets. Giving big tech com panies
unfettered access to the m aterial these creators produce, without due com pensation, will chill the creativity of Am erica. In doing so, the
United States could quickly cede its worldwide lead in the arts, sciences and letters. You would not give the natural resources of the
United States to som e com pany to use for their own exclusive use; why would you do the sam e for tech com panies looking to exploit the
United States’ m ost valuable resource: it’s citizens. Thank you for the opportunity to com m ent.
