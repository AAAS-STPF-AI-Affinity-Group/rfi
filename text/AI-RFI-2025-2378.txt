General Comment
The idea of using artificial intelligence to bypass copyright laws and use other people's original works and intellectual properties is nothing
m ore than an illegal crim inal offense to train their AI to steal im ages, videos, writing m aterials, and other form s of m edia and claim  it as
their own. Please reconsider and have AI not to be used by anyone in politics, including Elon Musk, DOGE, and the Trum p
adm inistration. Thank you.
