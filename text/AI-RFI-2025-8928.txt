General Comment
AI has no place in any creative field. It creates nothing and steals everything. It can only exist to tear down the people actually creating
things, while failing to ever m ake anything with any actual m erit itself.
It needs to be STOPPED not enabled. Even if it's given all the control in the world it's still a dead end bubble soon to pop, but the
dam age along the way is unacceptable.
