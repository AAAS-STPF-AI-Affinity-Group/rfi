General Comment
Giving AI free reign would heavily stifle Am erican creative industry, leaving thousands of hard working Am erican creators struggling at the
whim s of big AI tech com panies seeking to pad their profits. The governm ent needs to take a stand to protect individual copyright
holders, and say NO to expanding the ability of AI com panies to use creative works to which they have no right or entitlem ent. Stand with
Am erican creators, and say NO to expanding AI plundering!
