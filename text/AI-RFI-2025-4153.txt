General Comment
These supposedly "burdensom e requirem ents" are necessary as they protect the work of Am ericans who have produced and continue to
pursue creative endeavors in art, writing, etc that have been hand crafted by the hard work and effort of Am erican artists, writers, etc
whose livelihoods rely on owning the m aterial and Intellectual property that they produce. AI has been found over and over to only be
able to function through the theft of an astronom ical am ount of already owned works. I am  a graphic designer, and AI steals both from  m y
livelihood and other creative Am ericans' livelihoods and profits off of theft and these com panies pushing so hard to rem ove copyright and
other essential protections from  artists/creatives do so without a care for the Am ericans' lives that they risk. I do not believe AI holds a
place in the future of the US. Thank you for your tim e.
