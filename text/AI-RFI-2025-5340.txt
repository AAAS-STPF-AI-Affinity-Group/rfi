General Comment
AI steals from  m y work as an academ ic and as a creative writer. AI m ust com pensate people for any use of copyrighted training m aterial,
and AI-generated m aterials m ust not be copyrightable. The current m ethods of obtaining and using training data are in breach of copyright
law. In addition, repeated investigations show AI to be inefficient and expensive, particularly in term s of water and energy. I am  opposed
to any m easures m aking it easier for com panies or the governm ent to violate copyright law, put writers out of work, and dam age the
environm ent.
