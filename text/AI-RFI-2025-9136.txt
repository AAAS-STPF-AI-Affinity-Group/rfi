General Comment
AI shouldn't be allowed to steal people's art or data or whatever:( No one should be allowed to legally steal things:( Not cool:( If they
want stuff to train stuff off of,then they should legally be required to use either public dom ain/fair use stuff or get people to agree to using
their data for the purpose of training AI:) Legalizing the theft of everyone's data online hurts those that put tim e and effort that created it in
the first place and really doesn't actually benefit anyone:(
