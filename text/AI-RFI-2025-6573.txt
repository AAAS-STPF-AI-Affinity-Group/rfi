General Comment
Generative AI is a threat to m y career, and to the careers of m any others in a vast swath of the Am erican jobs sector. Furtherm ore, the
engines that run generative AI have been developed by the use of unlicensed im ages and written m aterials swept up by com panies
counting on the bill never com ing due, and the US governm ent and legal system  not keeping up with their grift. Please, prove them  wrong,
and defend Am erican creators.
