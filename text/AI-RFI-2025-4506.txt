General Comment
I do not want corporations to have the ability to steal m y work to fund their AI m odels. If they want to use work, they can ask to use it
and pay a license fee like anyone else would be expected to. Either copyright is a thing or it isn't but we cannot allow AI com panies a free
pass just because they want it.
