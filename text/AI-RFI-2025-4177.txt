General Comment
Allowing AI to train on creative m aterials without approval or com pensation from  the copyright holders is a form  of theft that underm ines
the very foundation of artistic and intellectual labor. Authors, designers, and other creators invest tim e, skill, and originality into their work,
expecting recognition and fair com pensation for their efforts. When AI m odels ingest these works without perm ission, they strip creators
of control over their own intellectual property, exploiting their labor without providing anything in return. This not only devalues individual
contributions but also discourages future creativity, as artists and writers m ay find it increasingly difficult to sustain them selves in a system
that freely extracts their work for profit. Ultim ately, unchecked AI training erodes the incentives for original creation, leading to a cultural
landscape where innovation is stifled, and authentic voices are drowned out by m achine-generated im itations.
