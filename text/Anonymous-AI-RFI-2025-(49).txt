Revocation of the Biden-Harris AI Executive Order 14110 of October 30, 2023 (Safe, Secure,
and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence), has the opposite effect ofstated Trump goals, is short sided, and violates copyright laws.
The revocation of Executive Order 14110, which emphasized the "Safe, Secure, and
Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence," could hamper private sector AIinnovation in several ways:
1. **Loss of Safety and Transparency Frameworks**: EO 14110 required private companies
to share results of safety tests (e.g., red-teaming) for high-risk AI models. This encouragedtransparency and collaboration between the government and private sector, fostering trust inAI systems. Its removal may lead to inconsistent safety practices across the industry[1][2][3].
2. **Disruption of Regulatory Certainty**: The Biden EO laid out clear guidelines for AI
development, including frameworks for algorithm transparency and data interoperability.Revoking these efforts creates uncertainty for businesses, potentially delaying investments orproduct launches due to unclear regulatory expectations[1][4].
3. **Paused Federal Initiatives**: Several initiatives inspired by EO 14110, such as the
Department of Commerce's rulemaking on dual-use AI models and the U.S. AI SafetyInstitute, are now under review or halted. These initiatives provided critical support forinnovation while addressing risks like misuse of foundation models[2][5].
4. **Shift in Priorities**: The replacement Trump EO focuses on enhancing U.S. global AI
dominance but is relatively light on specific policy directives. This shift may deprioritizesafeguards that balance innovation with ethical considerations, leaving gaps in areas likeconsumer protection and equity[4][7].
While the Trump Administration's new policies aim to reduce barriers to innovation, the
absence of structured safety protocols and regulatory clarity could hinder long-term privatesector growth in AI.
