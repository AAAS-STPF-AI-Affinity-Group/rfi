General Comment
I oppose this Action Plan on the base that it requires that copyrighted works and private inform ation be used to train AI system s. This is a
huge infringem ent on copyright law, both for corporations and private individuals. It will allow AI tools to directly steal from  these entities
and will lead to a collapse of the econom y. Current AI tools are not m eeting the expectations of consum ers and governm ent investm ent in
these AI system s through public funds is not in our interest when m uch of our public infrastructure is worthy of m ore critical investm ent.
