General Comment
The AI system s m ade by Big Tech com panies like OpenAI (Microsoft) and Google threaten to destroy thousands of Am erican sm all
businesses like m ine with their recent dem and to create special carve outs in copyright law.
I've seen this all over Birm ingham - from  Show Posters to m y own boss using it to write scripts to autom ate spreadsheets. While i have no
doubt there m ay be som e sundry use for autom ation, we m ust ask ourselves as artists, "Where does the buck stop?" 
I am  a painter, I arrange m usic for m y friends to read poetry to, I love art and artists all over Am erica and the world. How are they
supposed to continue to m ake a living in the arts? What will the governm ent do to ensure they can survive if not by the fruits of their labor?
We cannot have an exception for a corporate entity to dodge scrutiny on theft of people's art. 
I have no doubt there will com e a tim e where we wield these tools with respect for the crafts that they purport to autom ate, but as they
stand now? They are by and large being used to threaten working Am ericans. 
Take two seconds and consider that being "good for business" is not, nor has ever been, good for people.
