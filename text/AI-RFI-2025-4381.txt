General Comment
AI (which is not even true Artificial Intelligence, it is Machine Learning) requires the creative labor of actual people in order to function. It
is wholly unethical to allow m achine generated applications to scrape the work of others who did not consent to their work being utilized
for this purpose, in order for those who did not put in any of the work to profit. This exists solely to devalue the skills of real people who
deserve to have their work retain its integrity. AI cannot function on its own to create, it can only copy and steal the work that already
exists. It will never m ake som ething new, and the push for AI in so m uch of the current zeitgeist is disingenuous in its intentions. The
people pushing AI want to m ake actual creatives obsolete, while still profiting off their work. It is a blatant attem pt to avoid giving credit,
both in nam e recognition and m onetarily. AI doesn't take into consideration the quality and m eaning of the work it scrapes. It consum es an
excessive am ount of electricity just to run as well, draining our country of its water resources in the process. AI is soulless, exploitive, and
wasteful. It will never m ake real art. The Am erican public does not favor AI, and public interest has drastically declined since it becam e
culturally relevant in the past few years. It is, at its core, a scam , and does exponentially m ore harm  to US citizens and our environm ent.
Anyone who cares about those two things will not less this continue.
