General Comment
I am  a US citizen and a 28 year old professional artist, author, and researcher in biological sciences. I am  astounded that this is even a
discussion and that there was NO announcem ents regarding this disgusting overstep of AI's abilities, yet I m ust spend tim e voicing m y
strong opposition to any leeway given to OpenAI. I am  fully against OpenAI having any im m unity, protection, or any other form s of
special treatm ent in regard to copyright violation. As it stands, OpenAI's current practices am ount to theft of intellectual properties owned
by real artists, writers, and other IPs. If the governm ent further em powers OpenAI to steal m ore data with this proposed resolution and
act by Sam  Alton and his com pany, then there is no longer any protection for creators and creative works such as art, writing, and so on. 
OpenAI should not be allowed to further operate in this m anner and should NOT be further em powered to fuel the greed of those it will
never benefit. They m ust be regulated or rem oved entirely. To whom ever reads this, let it be known that I am  a US tax paying and law
abiding citizen who had always stood, and will always stand, against the corrupt overstepping of AI com panies, both private and federally
funded. The abuse of artists, authors, researches in not only the arts but also the sciences can no longer stand and m ust end im m ediately.
