Innovation Recommendations  
Summary of Key Challenges  
• A multi -faceted AI action plan . An AI action plan needs to be multi -faceted to be 
eGective. Leadership in AI in the U.S. can be attributed to many features of the U.S. 
and global scientiﬁc enterprise, including  
o open global dissemination of ideas through scientiﬁc publications and 
computer code sharing.  
o the dominance of U.S. institutions of higher education in computer science 
and STEM ﬁelds in general, which owes a lot to strong federal funding and 
their openness and ability to recruit the best talent from across the world;  
o private funding, a healthy start -up ecosystem, a light regulatory framework, 
and ﬁnancial markets that funded the translation of basic research into 
products and powerful AI models; and  
o dominance in compute infrastructure that can be attributed to scientiﬁc 
research in chip design and manufacturing and a powerful, government 
funded compute infrastructure at the various national labs.  
For the U.S. to maintain its leading role, particular care is needed to avoid breaking 
any aspect of the system that led us to a dominant position in AI. The lack of a very 
stringent regulatory framework can be useful, and it has enhanced all features 
high lighted above, but, on its own, it cannot prevent the erosion of the U.S. 
dominant position in AI. For example, curtailing research funding will  jeopardize 
future scientiﬁc discoveries and  greatly diminish the workforce development that 
Universities provide for the U.S. to maintain its leadership position in AI.

• Transparency, explainability, privacy, and accountability . AI is increasingly 
aGecting and relied upon for many labor - and thought -intensive tasks, from enabling 
increased automation in manufacturing, automating many business functions and 
oGice work, and even performing advanced reasoning for scientiﬁc disco very, health 
care diagnostics, and decision making. Because many decisions made by AI 
systems aGect humans, transparency and accountability is crucial. Incentives 
and/or mandates are needed to ensur e that an AI system can explain/justify a 
decision or recommendation to any human who is on the receiving end. Similarly, 
mandates may be needed for companies that oGer AI products to disclose 
processes, what they do with data users contribute (e.g., in A I chatbox interactions), 
what data have been used for training their models, and what forms of testing their 
models undertake before they are released to the general public. In general, issues 
of data provenance, governance, and privacy are critical and so  is the ability of users 
to opt -out of any product features that may infringe on data privacy.  
 
• Cost of compute and imbalance in computing resources between academia 
and industry . Increasingly, there is a large imbalance in the quantity and type of 
computing resources available at academic institutions compared to the ample 
resources available in industry. With industry being focused on shorter -term goals, 
this imbalance can aGec t future scientiﬁc innovation. A robust federally funded 
computing infrastructure is needed, at the national labs, through equipment grants 
to academia, and also through eG orts like the NAIRR program  being piloted b y NSF  
that needs to be maintained and signiﬁcantly expanded.  
 
Examples of Success and Speciﬁc Initiatives to Leverage  
1.1 AI Research Infrastructure  
• Expand funding for AI research hubs  leveraging the example of BU’s Hariri Institute 
for Computing and Computational Science & Engineering   
(https://www.bu.edu/hic/  ), which drives interdisciplinary AI research and policy 
development.  
• Strengthen university -industry collaborations through models like BU’s partnership 
with MassMutual  (BU-MassMutual ), advancing AI -driven ﬁnancial modeling and 
risk assessment.  
• Support initiatives like the Massachusetts AI Hub  at the Federal level , integrating 
research leadership in AI governance and responsible innovation.  
• Invest in high -performance computing resources  at facilities like the 
Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) , which 
contributes to scalable AI research and sustainability -focused AI applications.

• Promote open -source AI development and ethical AI frameworks as we do in  BU’s AI 
& Data Science initiatives,  ensuring broader accessibility and transparency.  
1.2 Interdisciplinary AI Applications  
• AI for Public Health & Medicine : Expand AI -driven disease detection, personalized 
medicine, and computational drug discovery, leveraging BU’s research in 
biomedical engineering , clinical translation,  and public health.  
• AI for Climate & Environmental Science : Support AI applications in climate 
modeling, biodiversity tracking, and environmental policy, aligning with BU’s 
sustainability and urban planning research.  and global sustainability . 
• AI & Social Sciences : Invest in AI -driven policy analysis, misinformation tracking, 
and ethical AI frameworks, integrating law, political science, and communication 
studies.  
• Creative & Computational AI : Enhance research on AI -generated art, media 
studies, and human -AI collaboration,  e.g.,  BU’s eGort  in digital humanities  and 
computational design.  
• Robotics & Autonomous Systems : Expand applications in smart transportation, 
soft robotics, and autonomous decision -making, building on BU’s interdisciplinary 
robotics  initiatives   
 
2. Education Recommendations  
BU’s AI stance emphasizes the need for all higher education programs to “critical ly 
embrace”  AI, thereby  embracing its transformative potential in every discipline, but also 
adopting processes that help educate faculty and students in this critical technology, 
democratizing access, and that seek to understand and mitigate some of the negative 
impacts. Negative AI impacts include over -reliance, which can lead to atrophy of human 
skills, sustainability of the compute infrastructure to support AI model training, and ethical 
implications, such as its potential to be used for harm, accentuating biases, and sp reading 
misinformation. Federal policies need to be informed by such negative impacts, fund 
research in a restrictive regulatory framework that prevents large excesses and ensures 
human control of AI systems.  
A massive swarth of our future workforce will require generative AI literacy from basic use 
to its impact on speciﬁc ﬁelds or applications. The federal government can catalyze a new 
generation of industry -academic partnerships to ensure that the students  graduating from 
any ﬁeld ha ve the commensurate AI skills needed to immediately be of value to 
companies. Examples of this in other domains have recently been described in Harvard 
Business Review  and other places.

Key Areas of Emphasis Recommended Include:  
2.1 AI Literacy Across Disciplines  
•Integrate AI education across all disciplines , ensuring non -STEM students develop
AI literacy.
•Encourage prompt engineering and GenAI best practices  in higher education
curricula.
•Establish Nationally r ecognized  certiﬁcation programs  for AI competency.
2.2 Faculty & Student AI Training  
•Support faculty professional development  in AI -driven pedagogy, as we are doing
based on the recommend ations of  BU’s AI Task Force .
•Provide support   for universities to develop AI -focused courses and workshops.
•Develop centralized repositories of AI teaching materials , ensuring equitable
access to high -quality learning resources.
2.3 AI Policy & Classroom Implementation  
•Deﬁne national guidelines for AI in coursework .
•Promote equitable access  to AI -assisted learning tools through partnerships with
public and  private institutions  and Federal initiatives such as NAIRR .
•Fund research into AI’s role in student learning , emphasizing ethical AI use and
critical engagement .
Conclusion  
These recommendations support a nationally coordinated AI strategy that fosters ethical 
innovation and AI literacy in education. By investing in research infrastructure, interdisciplinary collaboration, and AI education, we can position the U.S. as a global leader in responsible AI development.
