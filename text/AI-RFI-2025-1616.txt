General Comment
Quick question: Does our presidential adm inistration EVER get tired of lying through their teeth??
I m ean, having generative AI to, "prom ote hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness, and national security"? This is the sam e
technology infam ous for m isinform ation, scam s, plagiarizing decades of digital m edia, overcrowding genuine entertainm ent like a m alignant
tum or, and falsifying your own president's voice on YouTube videos too m any tim es to count. On the point of m isinform ation, that sam e
POTUS posted a generated im age about Candada FEATURING THE MATTERHORN to his social m edia. This was from  a person's
whose job is literally international diplom acy, and generative AI has him  knowing what he's saying even less than usual.
The Am erican public doesn't want this useless counterfeiting technology in the sam e way they didn't want Orange Bin Laden supervising
plane crashes (No wonder New York tried to vote him  out).
