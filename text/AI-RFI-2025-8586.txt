General Comment
As an artist, "generative artificial intelligence" m achine learning m odels have no use or purpose in either the governm ent or entertainm ent as
a whole. These com panies are taking away from  artists, and from  activities used relatively as leisure, instead of focusing on utilizing
m achine learning m odels to take away from  the m ore tedious and undesirable tasks of life. These m assive corporations should not be
allowed to steal from  artists countless hours and hard work for the sake of corporate greed and investor profits.
