General Comment
I ardently oppose this proposed rule. Intellectual work is the property of the person(s) who create it alone, unless they knowingly choose
to share their ownership rights. Allowing AI program s to profit off of Am ericans is unethical and dangerous. We need to protect the
intellectual and artistic output of Am ericans, which is far and away the m ost valuable asset of our country
