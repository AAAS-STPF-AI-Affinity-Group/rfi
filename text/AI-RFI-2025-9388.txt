General Comment
Hello, I firm ly believe that AI does NOT hold a future in the US. Every day, I have friends, fam ily, and loved ones who are losing their
jobs due to being replaced by AI technologies that do their jobs worse. My m other, while she still holds her career, has found AI to be
nothing but a hurdle for workplace productivity, as the sudden enforcem ent of AI tools have caused num erous errors in im portant
docum ents that im pede workflow rather than help it. I am  certain that m ore m oney and productivity has been lost trying to im plem ent
these tools than it has saved businesses any.
Widespread use of these tools hasn't been helping us, it has been hurting us Am ericans. We don't want big tech to force AI down their
throats, m uch less allow them  to steal our hard work for use in their m achines. Giving them  less copyright protections will only hurt those
who create and work hard. We deserve to be able to have the right to not want anything to do with these system s, we should have the
freedom  to choose whether or not we want our work to be in AI algorithm s, and we want transparency and clarity from  big tech in their
use, intention, and im plem entation of these system s. 
Art, writing, and m usic m atter just as m uch as anything else. Do not give robots and big tech the ability to supersede hum an creation.
