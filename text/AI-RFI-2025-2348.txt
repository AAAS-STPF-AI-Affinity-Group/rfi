General Comment
Copyright is im portant for not only artists and illustrators, but m arketing and businesses in general. To release copyrighted m aterial to the
private Artificial Intelligence sector is not only a violation of an individual's right to own their own creative work, but continues to allow
large AI sectors to work above the law and take m aterial from  other businesses with those businesses having no recourse. I believe this
gives AI sectors an unfair business advantage over any sort of com pany that does not have the resources to invest in large-scale AI
generation and scrapers. This can enforce current tech m onopolies and is unhealthy not only for the individual citizen but for businesses in
general.
