General Comment
AI com panies should not have exem ptions from  this land's rules on copyright. If we are aim ing to m ake these m achines as capable of
assisting hum ans as possible, they should be held up to the sam e rules as hum ans. To claim  otherwise is to not only harm  the livelihood of
artists everywhere, but also set extrem ely dangerous precedents for AI going forward.
