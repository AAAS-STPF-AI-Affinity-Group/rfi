General Comment
Please DO NOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE!
I do not want m y artwork to be stolen and used in such a m anner! I have been creating work for over 20 years and feel like this "AI" is a
push to cut out the entirety of m y life from  the world and for clueless tech bros to bypass the hard work, creative soul, and long am ounts
of tim e it has taken m yself and thousands of other artists to create their worlds, build their styles, and justify their existences to the world.
Allowing AI to blindly scoop up all of our work and blend it all into soulless slop is beyond chilling for the future and would NOT create a
better world for anyone looking to brighten the world with their own unexpected and unique art. PLEASE DO NOT let them  com e even
>close< to stealing m y future for profit! I do not want to be cast aside like thousands of other artists and deem ed 'useless' to people
without creativity, it would be worse than any anim ated cartoon villain ever m ade!
Do not let our work be stolen for profit!
