As we develop the next AI Action Plan, I think the following will be crucial components: * 
making our data centers energy -efficient and water -efficient * protecting artists' and writers' and 
scientists' intellectual property * protecting individuals' priva cy, by not having their data used 
without their informed consent * funding the development of both new algorithms and new 
science that uses them * allowing international collaboration to make these advances * educating 
the public about the benefits and dan gers of AI
