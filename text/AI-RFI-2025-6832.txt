General Comment
I don't even know where to start. 
I work in the tech space, for a m ajor tech com pany with lots of investm ents in the AI space and I can tell you three things, with absolute
certainty:
1) AI does not work as advertised. It's output is flawed 60%+ of the tim e according to recent studies.
2) It is a tech bubble scam , it is the next evolution of Crypto and NFTs. All designed and pushed to sell the hardware necessary to run it.
3) Generative AI, and the com panies that push it, can only survive on the outright theft of other people's hard work.
Em bracing this technology is foolish at best, but allowing com panies to steal Intellectual Property to train their m odels on and, ultim ately,
profit off of those m odels with no protections or renum erations for the creators whose IP was stolen, is yet another way this country is
failing its citizens.
