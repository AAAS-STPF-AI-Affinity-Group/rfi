To all lawmakers and law enforcement officers of the federal government of the United States of 
America, I am interested in the development of Generative Artificial Intelligence. I want to make 
sure that lawmakers and law enforcement understand that Genera tive AI should not be trained 
using unlicensed intellectual property that is not in the public domain. Unrestricted use of 
intellectual property will hurt creators of intellectual property, both economically and 
motivationally, weakening the foundations of  intellectual property in the USA and having a 
chilling effect on the creation of intellectual property by US citizens. This will result in economic 
weakening of the USA. Any use of copyrighted intellectual property by Generative AI needs to 
be licensed fr om the IPâ€™s creators. I also want to make sure that lawmakers and law enforcement 
understands that under US law, US copyright is limited to works of human creation. Works 
generated by Generative AI are not eligible for copyright. Any change to US law to gr ant any 
sort of copyright to works generated by Generative AI will help to weaken US economy and 
have a chilling effect on the creation of intellectual property by US citizens. Sincerely, Eric 
Shanower
