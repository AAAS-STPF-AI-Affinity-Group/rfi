General Comment
The current "policies and directives that act as barriers" to GenAI have largely com e because of wronged parties asserting their rights to
their work and words.
Large swathes of the training data for AI have com e from  scraping copywritten inform ation that can be rem ade by AI in an attem pt to
skirt paying licenses to the original creators. For visual art and im ages especially, it's well-known that various artists nam es have becom e
frequently used "prom pts" to generate work sim ilar in style and com position to their existing works.
Actors and m usicians have found their voices and features being trained to create AI duplicates to steal their voices and likenesses.
Reporters and researchers have their articles and books fed into the algorithm s, and now when people search for inform ation, instead of
finding the original writings, it's paraphrased by the search engine AI, with no reference to the original sources.
There are som e wonderful applications for specialized AI in science and engineering, doing public good that justifies using copywritten
datasets as they were intended, but m y experiences with GenAI, and seem ingly m ost of their m oney, doesn't com e from  these
applications. Instead, these com panies are looking to m ake a quick buck by finding ways to steal the work of others and try to sell it back
to us at a prem ium .
