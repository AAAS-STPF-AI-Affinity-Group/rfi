General Comment
Allowing OpenAi to use copyrighted works without consent or com pensation will be the death of Am erican innovation. It will strip any
and all incentive to develop new IP, inventions or technologies if works that under other circum stances would be forced to be licensed or
not allowed to m ake m oney with go to an AI com pany and added to their dataset. Why would a sm all business like a publisher, m usic
studio or advertising firm  create anything if there'd be no way for them  to m onetize it because as soon as it's forward facing in any m anner,
OpenAi will sim ply generate inferior copies instantly. Custom s and Border control spend huge am ounts of capital every year to intercept
bootleg m aterials because of its dam age to brands and the overarching econom y, and yet give a free pass to a com pany that has shown no
dem onstrable way to turn a profit with their product as their services are largely unpopular and unwanted. Do not change copyright on
this, what OpenAi is planning to do goes against Fair Use in every definition: using artists own work to push them  out of their livelihood
