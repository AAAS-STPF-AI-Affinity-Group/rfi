General Comment
I do not see how allowing generative AI program s would benefit the nation by stealing from  tax paying Am ericans like m yself. All it will do
is disenfranchise com m on Am ericans by stealing their works. Surely weakening the livelihoods of the com m on Am erican will do nothing
but weaken the country as a whole.
