General Comment
I am  a student of the arts, currently earning m y bachelors in studio arts; I'm  an illustrator and painter (digitally and traditionally), a
seam stress, a sculptor and an author. The artwork m e and m y peers create should be protected from  AI's grasp. 
Generative AI m odels are built on theft, disregarding artists copyright, then butchering the fruits of their labor and stitching the corpses
back together into soulless digital im age. Artists receive no com pensation for their contributions to the m odels, these contributions often
include their entire library of work, personal and com m issioned for larger productions. When an AI m odel trained on an artists work is
chosen over the artist, Am erica looses iteration, creativity, and progress of any kind. If AI is allowed to becom e the dom inant tool of
creation over our own two hands we will stagnate.
DO NOT, loosen AI com panies responsibility to source perm ission to use copyrighted m aterials to train their m odels. Artists deserve
com pensation for their contributions to society at large. 
Protect Am erican artists and Am erican art.
