General Comment
As an artist who's work has been scraped to train AI without perm ission or recom pense I find it deeply insulting that the governm ent
would consider eroding copyright further. This technology was built on the theft of our hard work. Why should AI com panies be exem pt
from  paying for the works they are using? I'm  not. I can't just use another artists' work without perm ission and/or paym ent. If AI is Trident
as powerful and beneficial as they claim  they can do the m oral and legally right thing and pay for content like everyone else. 
To underm ine artists' rights is to attack their work, their livelihood, and the future of art and culture. Why would anyone create anything if
it can be legally stolen by a com pany? 
Please, be the voice of all the artists not represented by trem endous wealth. We just want to be able to create without being robbed.
