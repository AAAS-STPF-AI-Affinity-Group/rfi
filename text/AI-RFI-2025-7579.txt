General Comment
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is trained off of data that has been collected off the works of
people who have not been com pensated for their contribution and then seeks to replace those sam e people. The am ount of resources AI
uses up is not worth the content it generates and is not worth the num ber of lives that it will negatively im pact.
