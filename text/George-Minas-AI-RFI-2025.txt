1. Hardware and Chips: Strengthen Domestic Supply Chains Policy Action: Accelerate
investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing through targeted tax incentives and public -
private partnerships, building on the CHIPS and Science Act framework. Prioriti ze production of
next-generation chips optimized for AI workloads (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) to ensure U.S. companies
have a competitive edge. Policy Action: Streamline export control policies to focus on genuine
national security risks while avoiding blanket rest rictions that inadvertently weaken U.S. firms’
global market position. Reconsider partnerships with countries that might give away our tech to
our adversaries (China, Russia, Iran, DPRK, terrorist groups). Conduct a 90 -day review to assess
the efficacy of current controls in light of foreign AI breakthroughs. 2. Energy Consumption and
Efficiency: Power AI Growth Sustainably Policy Action: Establish a federal task force within
120 days to identify and designate “AI Energy Zones” on federal lands with access to abundant
clean energy (e.g., nuclear, geothermal). Pair this with expedited permitting processes to
operationalize data centers by mid -2027, reducing regulatory delays. Policy Action: Offer grants
or low-interest loans to private entities developing ene rgy-efficient AI hardware and cooling
technologies, with a goal of reducing data center energy consumption by 20% within five years.
3. Innovation and Competition: Foster a Free -Market AI Ecosystem Policy Action: Create an “AI
Innovation Sandbox” program w ithin 180 days, allowing startups and small businesses to test AI
models and applications with temporary exemptions from select regulatory requirements (e.g.,
data reporting). This would lower barriers to entry and accelerate market -ready solutions. Policy
Action: Direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue guidance within 120 days
clarifying that antitrust enforcement will not penalize collaborative AI research among U.S.
firms, provided it strengthens domestic competitiveness against foreign rivals . 4. National
Security and Defense: Safeguard AI Leadership Policy Action: Mandate a joint Department of
Defense (DoD) and intelligence community assessment within 150 days to identify critical AI
technologies requiring enhanced protection (e.g., model wei ghts, training datasets). Implement
lightweight security protocols that safeguard these assets without hindering private sector
collaboration. Policy Action: Increase funding for the DoD's AI programs by 25% in the FY2026
budget, focusing on autonomous sys tems and cybersecurity defenses against AI model attacks,
ensuring the U.S. military remains ahead of strategic competitors.
