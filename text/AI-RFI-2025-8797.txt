General Comment
As a professional artist for 25 years, please listen. Ai steals from  copyrighted art and writing and will destroy m ultiple industries and
econom ies. It appears to be and easy cheap fix but with no new art to feed on it will becom e the snake eating its tail of m ythology. If
artists cannot be paid for art then no art will be m ade. Please do not allow this to happen.
