General Comment
The current policies and practices of AI related com panies allow them  to take copyrighted works and repurpose them  with no regard for
the original creators. This needs to change. There needs to be an overhaul on the use of personal and copyrighted m aterial to train AI
m odels. These com panies steal hard work from  artists and offer cheap replacem ents, taking jobs, opportunities, and work from  artists and
using their own m aterial to do so. AI is not like hum an intelligence, it cannot discern what is appropriate or not, it cannot offer the sam e
value or quality of hum an work. In this m arket and econom y AI threatens to steal and replace from  m illions of creatives using the very
work they have created for decades. Consider the hum an dam age this will have years down the line when our children cannot produce
their own art or use their im aginations because AI com panies have lead them  to believe that they are suitable replacem ents for hum an
expression.
