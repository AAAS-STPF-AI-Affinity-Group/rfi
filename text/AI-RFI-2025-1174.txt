General Comment
My nam e is Julianne Knable and I am  a graduating senior from  Avonworth High School. I researched the im pact of generative AI on
cybersecurity for a sem ester course, and recently studied this adm inistration's viewpoint on AI regulation. Based on m y two m onths of
student research, I think that regulation of AI is necessary as it grows within Am erica and around the world. There is a constant need for
security m easures to protect the country as m ore AI is involved, without replacing hum ans. AI in cybersecurity has created new
possibilities to easily detect and prevent threats. However as AI continues to grow and strengthen, the potential loss of security and
privacy does too. Com m unities have already grown for the better with the help of AI and advancem ents in technology but in order to stay
a healthy com m unity, not all form s of AI should be available to everyone. As cybersecurity works with the growing workings of
technology, there will be a stronger need for a balance between technology and hum an resources.
