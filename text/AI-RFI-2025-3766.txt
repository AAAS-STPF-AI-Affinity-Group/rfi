General Comment
Machine learning, which falsely brands itself as artificial intelligence when it is no such thing, is an active threat not only to the livelihoods of
creatives across the country but also to the inform ation Am ericans rely on every day.
A data set forever devouring itself will eventually only churn out garbage and that is already incredibly evident in how sim ple internet
searches have becom e fraught with inform ation that is m isleading at best and actively harm ful at worst.
Machine learning has its place. That place is doing things like identifying cancer cells, not 'writing' books it wholesale stole or creating art
with chopped up pieces it had no right to. 
Do not let silicone valley shill you into being their fall guy for yet another attem pt at reinventing the wheel for profit. It didn't work with
bitcoin, it didn't work with NFTs, it will not work with AI.
