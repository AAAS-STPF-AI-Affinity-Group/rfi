Hello OSTP,
Please consider the following: AI consumes human output to develop the algorithms they
claim mimic human creativity and craft. If you have no taste, it is possible that you may befooled by this argument. But people with classical training and a deep connection to the bestof the arts will instinctively understand that the "AI"
  champions of this age are simply to poor
to appropriately compensate exceptional artists to inform their models (and too uncultured torecognize these artists in the first place!) This is why they are asking the government to footthe bill and destroy copyright. They cannot afford it.
 
In short, I urge you to maintain copyright rules in favor of humans. The financial poverty andpoverty of culture experienced by so called "AI" companies is not a problem the governmentneeds to solve.
 
With all due respect,Keira Havens
