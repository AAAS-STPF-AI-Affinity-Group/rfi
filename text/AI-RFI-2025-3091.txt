General Comment
Generative AI and the AI industry both in our country and the world at large seek to underm ine Am erican values and exploit Am erican
workers.
Generative AI grossly m isuses natural resources, including large quantities of valuable electricity and water that would be put to m uch
better use serving the Am erican public. The AI industry is unprofitable and has been steadily costing m uch m ore m oney for years than it
has any hope of ever earning. 
Generative AI specifically and the AI industry as a whole are profoundly un-Am erican and seek to flagrantly violate any and all copyright
law to "im prove" their algorithm s. If the federal governm ent truly seeks to allow AI com panies and private corporations to act above the
law, it m akes this citizen wonder how m uch the adm inistration is directly benefitting from  doing so.
