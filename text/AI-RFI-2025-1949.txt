General Comment
Machine learning done in restricted, tight, non-creative areas? Maybe. Though it still too-often outputs dangerous and incorrect
inform ation, having it strictly m onitored is the only way we can prevent our capability as a nation from  falling for pleasant lies like sheepish
fools.
We can all agree - theft should not be legal. Yes? Then Generative AI (and any com pany or person using it) should never have been
allowed to illegally disregard the copyrights already granted to every person who creates a work. A m etal box with a screen is not hum an,
so don't fall for that particular ruse.
It's theft. It's not a valuable tool in the slightest. It's destroying the United States of Am erica's reputation, strength, and dignity. It's
em barrassing.
Generative AI 'outputs' uncerem oniously stealing from  billions of creative laborers and intellectual properties is, and always has been,
wrong. And you know it - because it is, in its entirety, anti-hum anity. If we let this blatant plagiarism  toy control us, say goodbye to a
bright future.
Do you want a bright future for you and your loved ones? Or do you want a m etal box soldered to your face that dem ands your wallet
until you've nothing left but fleshless bones?
