General Comment
Hello, I would like to express m y concerns about AI developm ent. I am  unsure how far it has progressed, but I have heard discussion of
how uncontrolled AI could potentially result in the extinction of hum anity. I would like for AI developm ent to focus on safety and hum an
protection over speed or ability.
