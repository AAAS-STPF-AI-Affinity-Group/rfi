General Comment
This docum ent is approved for public dissem ination. The docum ent contains no business-proprietary or confidential inform ation.
Docum ent contents m ay be reused by the governm ent in developing the AI Action Plan and associated docum ents without attribution.
AI is a rem arkably nebulous term  still. As such, it is difficult to call superiority, or even really cite truly ethical use, of AI as a whole. What
we do know of AI currently is that it swept the internet, taking in copyrighted data and built itself up illegally using that inform ation for
profit. As such, until such a tim e that all AI is put through rigorous exam ination to rem ove all of the data that isn't used with perm ission, this
executive order is pushing technically illegal activity.
In order to push this part through, AI has to be defined better, and refined to be fully legal and ethical.
