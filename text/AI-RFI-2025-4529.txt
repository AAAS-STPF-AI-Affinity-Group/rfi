General Comment
AI is horribly wasteful. It has been illegally benefiting from  stolen copyrighted m aterials for years and is not seeking the laws of the United
States be bent to allow them  to continue in their wholesale intellectual property theft. This m ust not be allowed. Artists and creators should
be entitled to their own creations or the dam age to som e of the m ost im portant industries in the country will be im m easurable.
