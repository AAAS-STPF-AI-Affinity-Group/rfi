General Comment
Generative "AI" steals from  m y livelihood and the livelihoods of m illions of Am ericans. It is not true artificial intelligence; it is a plagiarism
engine. It will ultim ately undercut its own existence, as it cannot function without hum an ingenuity to steal, but it will bring us down in the
process. 
This is not m erely about a new industry. This is about the future of hum an culture and creativity. Do not let this rot flourish without
consequence here in Am erica, or history will not rem em ber us fondly.
