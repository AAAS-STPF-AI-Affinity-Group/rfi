General Comment
I am  a com putational physicist who has used m achine learning in m y professional career for m any years. Machine learning, which covers
everything from  hidden Markov m odels to m ultilayer perceptrons to today's large language m odels, has been a very useful tool for pattern
recognition and especially for processing and interpolating large, m ultidim ensional datasets.
However, there is no reasonable interpretation of the law that should allow the storage and usage of copyrighted m aterial for "training"
m odels referred to as "artificial intelligence." The propensity of such m odels to "m em orize" their training data is sufficient to determ ine that
"training" cannot be considered fair use.
Com panies m ust not be allowed to use illegally downloaded, stored, and processed data in their m achine learning m odels for profit. This
would have severe and negative consequences for copyright holders whose data has been stolen and for com panies that have paid
copyright holders for appropriate licenses to do so.
