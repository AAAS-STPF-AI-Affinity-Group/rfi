General Comment
You are legalizing plagiarism . Sim ple as that. Actual artists and program m ers (both of these fields will be affected) put in hours of work to
create som ething they think is beautiful. Scraping it off the internet to train "AI m odels", which is great code for "pile of slop" is a slap in the
face to people like them .
