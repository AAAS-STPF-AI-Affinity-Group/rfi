General Comment
I’m  strongly urging that while innovation shouldn’t be tethered that copyright holders should still be protected under law. Are we not
entitled to keep ownership of our property? Our copyright? 
If ai is given free rein we will see consequences beyond our im agination unfold. I voted for you Mr. President, to keep Am ericans first.
Am erican jobs first. By giving control to these ai com panies, m illions of jobs will be lost. Please keep us, the Am erican people, in m ind
and continue to uphold the copyright law that protects our works. 
Thank you.
