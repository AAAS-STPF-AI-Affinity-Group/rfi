To allow unrestricted use/fund and support the use of AI in the US is both dangerous and a
waste of time. Not only does AI have a terrible return on investment, generating too littlerevenue to offset its cost, it also seriously harms all creatives due to it stealing their art, music,and voice. If you spoke to the average American, you'd know that they neither enjoy using AInor support it.
