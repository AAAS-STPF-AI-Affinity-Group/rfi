General Comment
AI technology is based on theft from  how it works to how it is used. It is theft when com panies train their AI on data that is being used
without perm ission, paym ent, contract, or even knowledge, and it is theft when the trained AI m odel is used to replicate that stolen work
to avoid having to pay the trained data's originators for the end product.
The idea that this com pany should be exem pt from  copyright law just because their com pany depends on theft to function is sickening.
Should a would-be hitm an be exem pt from  hom icide laws because the hitm an business m odel relies on hom icide?
