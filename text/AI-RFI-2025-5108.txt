General Comment
Large language m odels (which are not intelligent) and other versions of AI should not be allowed to use copyrighted m aterial for training
without the copyright holder's consent. These m odels basically use copy and paste to put their training data into "new" form s and call it
original. It's not original. Copyright infringem ent is a serious issue that affects the ability of actual creators to sell their work and thus
survive in our current environm ent.
