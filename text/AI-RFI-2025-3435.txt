General Comment
To whom  it m ay concern.
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States.
* AI steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off of theft.
* AI is overhyped, a scam  to rob people of their privacy, and has done nothing to create jobs or benefit the Am erican people.
Please reconsider this. Listen to to public and their valid concerns.
Thank you.
