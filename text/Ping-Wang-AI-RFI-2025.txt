My colleagues, students, and I applaud the President's executive order to remove the barriers to 
American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI). We do need a national AI action plan and 
start the actions soon to maintain American leadership in AI. The  recent DeepSeek surprise is a 
wake-up call for our urgent actions. Here are the essential components of the AI action plan: 1. 
Stable funding for talent development: Sustainable talent development is the key to maintaining 
long-term US leadership in AI. T he US must increase and maintain stable federal investment in 
AI research and education to motivate, nurture, and support AI talent selection and development 
on a national scale. 2. Integrate AI with Cybersecurity: AI is increasingly important and used in 
Cybersecurity defense and offense, which is critical to our national security and economic 
prosperity in the digital age. In addition, American AI innovations and trade secrets must be 
secured to maintain our leadership and competitiveness around the world . AI action plans must 
work in tandem with cybersecurity. 3. Leadership role of NSF: The US National Science 
Foundation CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (NSF SFS) program has proven successful in 
leading and organizing cyber talent development with stabl e funding from Congress. NSF should 
continue its leadership in AI actions using the tested CyberCorps SFS program model for talent 
development and is in the best position to integrate AI and Cybersecurity. It would be redundant 
and not cost -effective to cr eate a new and separate government agency to lead AI actions.
