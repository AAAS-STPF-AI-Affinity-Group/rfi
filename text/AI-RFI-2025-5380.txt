General Comment
The current m ethods of obtaining training data are im m oral, if not downright illegal, due to legal precedent set in the past. Worse,
Deepseekr-1 has shown that OpenAI's m ethods are inefficient and expensive to continue. And on top of that, the ecological im pact of
training AI as it currently stands consum es ridiculous am ounts of energy and, in m any cases, precious freshwater resources to cool these
training centers.
And as if that wasn't enough, these AI businesses are trying to argue that their industry can't survive without free access to use copyrighted
m aterial for their own profit - som ething no other industry has said. The signs are clear - the AI guardrails m ust rem ain in place.
