General Comment
Training GenAI on source m aterial without consent of that sourceâ€™s creator is tantam ount to theft. Allowing its regurgitated stolen content
to proliferate will result in a substantial creative drain as an increasing num ber of users forego real creators, putting m any of them  out of
business while they turn to the resultant slop instead as it becom es the only available option.
