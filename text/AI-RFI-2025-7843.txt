General Comment
As an Am erican citizen, I am  concerned by the front running AI developers' lack of appreciation for the creators whose works are used in
the training data on which their innovations rely on. The im ages, writings and other intellectual and creative productions are the result of
creators practicing their crafts, which in turn, result in valuable intellectual properties that they profit from  and earn their livelihoods, often
by sharing publicly online. If AI developers continue to sam ple from  artists, writers, etc., without proper crediting and com pensation in
accordance to copyright, then it is likely to result in the ceasing of sharing of such m edia online, leading to the sam e problem  of no new
data to further drive AI innovations.
