I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High School. I completed a 
semester -long course on AI and ethics and studied the impacts of generative AI on home 
technology. EO 14179 will be a mix of improvement and regression for home technology and policy about open source development. I say this because with more research and effort being put into making AI better and creating more AI products, the market for home products will definitely expand and more products will roll out making life easier for more and more people which is a plus for many. This act will be very beneficial for elderly and impaired people as more research, funds and products to help them live more comfortably will come into play. I think it will be detrimental though because of the laziness that will come along with it. I research ed a study between adverse childhood experience and adult obesity ratings and there is a 
positive correleation between them. By having a wider market of AI products and more different AI tools being used to replace everyday tasks I think the risk of laziness and adult obesity will raise. Simple tasks like walking the dog or other things that keep people active will be replaced resulting in laziness across the board
