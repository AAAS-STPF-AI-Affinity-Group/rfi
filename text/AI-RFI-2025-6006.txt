General Comment
If OpenAI has its way, no one will own the things they m ake anym ore. They want the ability to use m illions or billions of pieces of
intellectual property without proper licensing, attribution, or com pensation, all so that they m ight m ake GPT 5.0 a little better at sounding
hum an. It won’t suddenly stop hallucinating, and it won’t suddenly gain reasoning skills, it will just be m arginally better at producing text
that appears sim ilar to hum an-generated texts. At the cost of the livelihoods of m illions of artists of every kind across the country and the
planet.
Furtherm ore, as can be seen by som e of Microsoft’s latest actions re: OpenAI, not even its prim ary investor believes that OpenAI will be
a truly im portant part of the world going forward - if they did, they wouldn’t have backed down on som e of the data center contracts they
have been pursuing.
The White House wants to get rid of “burdensom e” copyright laws that protect regular people, so that they can benefit a corporation that
m ight not even last 10 m ore years. Do not do this.
