General Comment
To allow Generative Artificial Intelligence to bypass copyright laws would be catastrophic to the lively-hoods to various artist, both on a
business and independent level. If A.I. is able to just take anything to learn from , m any piece of art and m edia can be taken without a care,
being basically stolen from  without som eone's m eans to protect their work. This include various businesses trying to protect an intellectual
property that gets constantly used generate som ething from  Gen AI without perm ission. Allowing this to be done without any
repercussions from  any sort of copyright law is an absolutely danger to the creative fields m any rely on and should not be allowed.
