General Comment
I do not believe AI holds any future for the United States. OpenAI steals private inform ation and copyrighted m aterial in order to train its
m odels. Its output is garbage. It does dam age to artists and presents an anti-hum an approach to creation.
AI com panies cannot be trusted to use the inform ation responsibly.
