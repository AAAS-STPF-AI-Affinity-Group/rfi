General Comment
AI takes jobs away from  the creators its stolen work is built on, and profits off their labor. It's com pletely unethical, and only serves to line
the pockets of its investors, and create a greater wealth disparity of creatives who already struggle to m ake a living. AI should be given
NO exception to existing copyright laws, and needs to be held to higher standards.
