General Comment
The increased integration of and reliance on AI has m ade navigating the internet extrem ely frustrating. There is often no option to rem ove
AI assistance. This m akes using search engines frustrating, as the AI sum m ary is often wrong, or at least m isleading, itâ€™s not always clear
where it is getting the inform ation it is attem pting to sum m arize. It also m akes using pretty m uch any social m edia extrem ely unpleasant. AI
generated content clutters feeds with visual junk and spam  accounts are created faster than I can block them . What is especially troubling
are the ones that present them selves as journalistic or scientific sources. The inform ation they provide is often blatantly false and, with
social m edia com panies reducing their fact checking and adm in team s, this is setting the stage for a dangerously m isinform ed public.
