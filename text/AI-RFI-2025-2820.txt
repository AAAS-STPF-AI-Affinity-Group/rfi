General Comment
This is incredibly stupid and incredibly dangerous. Absolving AI of copyright infringem ent is theft, pure and sim ple. And any legislation that
advocates for the prevention of regulations for and/or the deregulation of AI and its com panies has no rational foresight. AI is
environm entally wasteful, it actively steals to create, the capabilities of AI are still being studied and hum ans are bullishly pushing it forward
without the proper discussion and approval of the public for whom  it has a diversity of negative im pacts. Stop AI, the m ajority of
Am ericans donâ€™t want it and it is actively harm ing us by its very existence.
