General Comment
AI com panies should not have free reign to sim ply take whatever they want from  wherever they want and use it for their AI. If you want
to use copywrited m aterial to train AI, you MUST first ask perm ission from  the copywriter and an agreem ent MUST be m ade. If
copywrite m eans nothing, does that m ean I can use the Trum p brand how I wish? If no, then this law is redundant.
