General Comment
Copyright law is not an ‘unnecessary burden’ on private AI com panies—it’s one of very few defenses available to the m illions of people
who work to create the art, research, and com m unication that ‘generative’ AI wants to churn up and replace. Unshackling these
com panies from  any potential consequences just lets them  steal from  actual hum an beings. And no, it won’t even preserve som e Am erican
AI dom inance—it’ll just m ake som e CEOs and shareholders richer. AI with actual value to our country and our world does not need
protection from  copyright law; any com pany that claim s otherwise is peddling nothing m ore than a plagiarism  m achine.
