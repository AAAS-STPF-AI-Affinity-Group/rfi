General Comment
As an Am erican I find this to be a threat to m y ability to m ake a living as it steals from  the work of educators, artists, historians, and others
who have worked for decades to pursue their craft. AI benefits the wealthy and forces the people to interpret nonsense and watered
down narratives rather than think freely
