General Comment
AI com panies should not be allowed to steal the work of whoever they want. 
AI in its current form  only steals inform ation and will not be able to do even half of what we were originally told to do.
AI com panies should not have access to everyone's copyright and person inform ation and likenesses to use as it pleases. We, as
Am ericans, deserve for our work to be our own and not stolen to be fed into databases so an AI can poorly copy it. 
AI should actually regulated to protect people, their likenesses, and their intellectual property
