General Comment
Hi there! 
We desperately need legislation that will start lim iting what AI com panies have access to and what they can generate and give to the
public.
I don't believe that com panies will consider the ethical ram ifications of pushing AI onto the public. It's a technology built on copyright
infringem ent--on the backs of centuries of actual, unwilling hum an creators with life experience and a vision. And for what? So som eone
can rapidly generate m ore soulless slop? It benefits no one but the com panies spearheading this technology, desperate to m ake another
soulless buck.
We've also seen with social m edia com panies that they will not take responsibility for what users post on their platform s. We've seen the
rise of cyberstalking, revenge porn, alt-right thinking, conspiracy theories, and general m isinform ation. What do you think will happen
when people have free rein to generate and deepfake whatever they want? The onus cannot be on the individual to sift through the
thousands of im ages and videos they look at every day. It just isn't realistic. AI will continue to im prove and it will be increasingly difficult
to tell what's real and what's fake. 
I believe we desperately need guardrails lim iting this technology and we need it NOW.
