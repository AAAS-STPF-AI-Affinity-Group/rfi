General Comment
Generative AI is Silicon Valley's false prophet, a grift that can only exist at the expense of hard-working Am ericans and their art. Allowing
OpenAI and other genAI com panies, services and m odels to freely steal from  creators will only rob the United States of its exem plary
position in the global art and m edia landscape.
It will send our cultural exports into a downward spiral of m ediocrity, with the works of brilliant patriots drowned out by bland ripoffs.
Household nam es like Disney and Warner Bros. will only see short-term  profits from  unfettered use of the tech; before long they'll be
scram bling to cannibalize each others' properties and churn out products of rapidly-degrading quality in order to stay com petitive.
When it com es to cultural relevance, we exist in a dog-eat-dog world. By allowing AI to tram ple all over our nation's copyright law,
you're feeding our dogs chocolate: a tasty treat, but a deadly poison.
Do the right thing. Don't let the world overtake us.
