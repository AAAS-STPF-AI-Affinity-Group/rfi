General Comment
as a citizen of the United States, I do not believe AI has a place in the future of our country. The technology is overhyped and m isleading,
and built atop m assive am ounts of copyright infringem ent. AI is used to underm ine labor, and the way it is being shoved everywhere is
both unpopular and unwanted. There is not a future for AI.
