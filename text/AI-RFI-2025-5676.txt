General Comment
AI deregulation and im m unity from  copyright infringem ent will destroy the livelihoods of m illions of artists, whose work these AI m odels
could not exist without. It serves no purpose than to take m oney from  hard working individuals and line the pockets of corporations and
billionaires. To pass this would be a full adm ittance, as is the case with m ost recent legislation, that the governm ent does not care about the
people it represents, and would rather increase the wealth gap and bring all but the richest into further accelerated econom ic decline.
