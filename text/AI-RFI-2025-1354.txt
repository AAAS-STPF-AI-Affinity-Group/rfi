General Comment
I’m  a stay at hom e, hom eschooling m om  who works as a blogger to m ake this possible. My website was hit hard with Google’s AI
updates. I lost 90% of m y incom e in the last year because of it from  m y website. I don’t think allowing Google and Open AI to scrape
sites like m ine for their benefit and AI training is going to do anything to help m y website or business grow any m ore. Laws like these are
going to force sm all publishers to give up creating content. Then what will Google have left for AI training? Nothing! This whole situation
needs to be thought out in a way that doesn’t leave sm all publishers behind but puts them  first and treats them  as partners. This is our
content and it is copyrighted. It’s not fair for Google to steal all of our hard work and force us to page 100 of searches so they can rank
their AI and partners like Reddit at all the top positions. If president Trum p truly wants to put fam ilies and m om s like m e first he will put a
stop to this!
