General Comment
A.I. should never, ever take away the work of hum an beings! It shouldn't be allowed to! Not in a m illion years, not for any reason!
Whether it's drawing, anim ating, writing, voice acting, film ing, effects editing, sound designing or video gam e coding, be they am ateur
projects that took a few hours or professional level pieces of art that had days, weeks, m onths or even years spent on them , those belong
to the creatives who dedicated their lives to practicing their crafts and constructing a variety of artistic expressions, and the creatives
should have the right to report theft!
A.I. is a cheap, unreliable shortcut that produces ugly and dysfunctional results which can never truly m atch what the m ost capable of
hum an hands and m inds are able to m ake! It has no business infringing copyrights on products of legit effort!
A.I. stealing what it wants without consequence and claim ing work for itself will only lead to the certain dem ise of art, entertainm ent and
creativity as we know it!
A.I. should only exist as a tool for the absolute m ost m enial of tasks people can also easily do, not to take over the m edium s of m edia or
threaten the em ploym ent of trained, real-life individuals!
