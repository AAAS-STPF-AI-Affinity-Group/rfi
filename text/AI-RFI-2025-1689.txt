General Comment
Artificial Intelligence, as m arketed, is the biggest scam  in Am erican life. It is a dangerous tool in the wrong hands. It consum es an
incredible am ount of resources for no good purpose. AI should taken out of the hands of for-profit enterprises. This country should NOT
invest in AI in the current environm ent. The current adm inistration will not use the technology in a positive fashion. It will be a tool for
corruption and to crush opposition.
