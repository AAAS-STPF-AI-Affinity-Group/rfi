The futility of this message weighs on me, but I will not wait for a future that does not have
anything for me without at minimum making my voice heard.
All of human history and progress has been contingent upon the integrity of recorded
information.    Generative AI, as it's being used by the tech industry right now, serves to
subvert the integrity of everything human beings touch.   It swallows up years of human labor
over night and turns a substantial profit off that labor by alienating it from the very peopleresponsible.
I am not raw material to be mined. My work is not raw material to be mined.
  My thoughts are
not raw material to be mined.   If the tech industry wants more data, make them pay for it.   If
my work is going to be used to make someone else obscenely rich, even if what I contributed
was worth only fractions of a cent, I should be entitled to it and I should have a say in whethermy information is going to be used and copied in the first place.
