General Comment
Hello, it is extrem ely illegal to allow openai to jum p over copyright. I need to stress that any of these AI im age generators WILL infrige on
not just copyright, but also iin the faces of m illion of civilians and be used for nefarious purposes
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
