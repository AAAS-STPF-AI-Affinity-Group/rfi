General Comment
I truly and wholly believe that AI does not add anything of substance to Am erica or the Am erican people. Let other countries burn m oney
on this idiotic tech bubble and try to save som e of the m oney that is cried constantly about. The AI bubble will pop very soon and leave
Am erica worse than better if it is allowed to pour m oney into the AI furnace, so stop and invest in other initiatives that are actually
productive, like nationwide highspeed rail system s.
