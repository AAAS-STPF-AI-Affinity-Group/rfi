General Comment
AI im age generation is broad scale theft of copyrighted m aterials. Any policy related to AI needs to include robust protections for artists
rights and m arks related to their intellectual property. More ideally, com panies who already em ploy data sets that include stolen works
should be fined, regulated, and m ade to pay dam ages to all artists from  whom  they've stolen.
