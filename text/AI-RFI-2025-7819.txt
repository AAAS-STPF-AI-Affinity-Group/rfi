General Comment
The use of large-scale AI system s shreds intellectual property rights of Am erican citizens and com panies. These system s steal from
creators without any notice or com pensation. Allowing these organizations to train their data m odels on privately owned photos, texts, and
other ideas com pletely rem oves the incentive for Am erican individuals and com panies to produce new works.
Additionally, since the m ass adoption of this technology within the past year, it has been proven that these system s are constantly factually
inaccurate. It is a com m on sight for AI text to hallucinate wholly fictional and incorrect inform ation and present it in a convincing way.
There is no accountability for this m isinform ation.
Unless there are efforts m ade to curtail the com panies that are stealing this inform ation from  Am erican citizens and com panies, the
Am erican people will suffer. We will see less reliable inform ation, we will have m ore difficulty interacting with the system s we use daily,
and we will be punished for creating written works, m usic, and pictures.
This is foolish to pursue.
