General Comment
It is unlawful to use, in whole or in part, the artwork or intellectual property of another with out seeking perm ission or offering
com pensation for said use in alm ost any other context in our society. It should therefore be unlawful to use the works of hum an creators in
the training of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) m odels without perm ission or com pensation.
This should especially be the case as m any A.I. m odels and their creators specifically wish to use said A.I. to replace or render redundant
the very creators of who's works are being sam pled to train the A.I. in the first place.
What's m ore, the tactics used by these com panies to obtain training data from  content creators, such as using works subm itted to social
m edia platform s, with NO OPTION to opt out of such use, and past subm issions being taken as consensually subm itted even though they
PRE-DATE the program s sam pling them , are unethical use of another's works or intellectual property.
I do not approve of or condone the U.S. Governm ent's sanctioning of such unethical and unlawful corporate behavior and I urge
lawm akers to reject any notion of legalizing it in future.
