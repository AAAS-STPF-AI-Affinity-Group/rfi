General Comment
Creating content costs m oney. It takes tim e, purchasing products, som etim es hiring writers photographers graphic designers. All of these
things com e at a cost to the creator and website operator. For AI to steal that content either verbatim  or via training is absolutely stealing.
It is taking without perm ission and without com pensation. It is wrong and should not be allowed.
