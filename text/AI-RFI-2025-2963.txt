General Comment
As a concerned citizen: I take AI being given unfettered access to copywrited m aterials an offense to the Am erican public. 
Tech com panies being given rights to steal and use m aterial without com pensation is a theft of the m anpower and creativity of the citizens
of the USA.
If a private citizen were to do the sam e they would be at risk of legal problem s 
If you claim  to support jobs of the people, please stand for the rights of everyday hardworking Am erican craftsfolk and artisans. They
deserve protection from t he unhealthy overreach of big tech both in our borders and out.
