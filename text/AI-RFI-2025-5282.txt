General Comment
Artificial Intelligence, as it currently stands, holds little benefit to future endeavors and should therefore be held to all standards of ethics.
They should not be given free access or im m unity to laws (such as plagiarism ) to act with im punity to further developm ent of what they are
calling AI.
