General Comment
As an artist and a scientist the copyright protections on m y intellectual property are incredibly im portant to m e. I spend days, som etim es
m onths and som e people spend years working on research or art pieces. A little piece of m e is put into every project I do. Using m y
copyrighted projects to train AI is theft. It is no different from  if a person decided to plagiarize m y work to m ake their own. AI cannot be
allowed to steal from  m illions of artist’s, writer’s, m usician’s, and researcher’s intellectual properties. And this doesn’t just apply to sm all
artists or research team s. AI would steal from  billion dollar com panies to plagiarize their work. DO NOT GIVE AI COMPANIES AN
INCH ON THIS. THIS IS OUR PROPERTY AND WE DO NOT CONSENT TO IT BEING USED TO TRAIN AI.
