General Comment
As an artist who m akes their livelihood from  the creation of original writing and illustration I see absolutely no value in the further
developm ent of generative artificial intelligence. To take the developm ent of generative AI a step further and allow com panies such as
Open AI or Google to train their AI m odels on copyrighted m aterials would be an egregious offense that would am ount to stealing from
the artists who created the original work. This request from  Open AI only dem onstrates that the technology itself is void of any inherently
original creation and cannot exist without exploiting the work of others. They're creating a problem  where there was none to begin with,
and they seek solutions that necessitate stealing. If the business m odel of com panies such as these cannot exist without properly citing and
com pensating the creators of the original work, then perhaps the com panies should not exist at all.
