General Comment
GenAI is nothing, but a theft m achine that leads to stagnation and on top of that, letting GenAI to deliberately sidestep Copyright Laws
m eans that NO ONE can protect their own work, thought, ideas and etc as you essentially allowing anyone, who wants to cash in on our
own property then it’s legally allowed. You don’t seem  to understand the dangers that GenAI is bringing in to our sphere especially m ore
than ever as GenAI has no safeguards on them  still, which even with Copyright Laws, we see the harm  that GenAI has done by stealing
jobs of folks and the m isinform ation, but then again, given how things are going in this country; you do want m isinform ation to spread
through our country. Not to m ention, you should know that GenAI also would poison the wells of our other countries’ own laws that we
also should’ve follow given our m any collaboration with them  as well. I don’t want to see m ore people lose their jobs/ inspiration because
the tech industry has no respect for our rights, privacy, thoughts, etc for the sake of a quick buck that would no doubt be lead to ruin as
they need a m an to fix their issues as GenAI is still not perfect and will give false positives etc.
