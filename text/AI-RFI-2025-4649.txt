General Comment
Any AI Action Plan needs to include regulation of AI technology, the proper com pensation for the use of copyrighted works in training
AI, and the ability for users to opt-in to AI services. Currently, tech providers are turning on AI features and services which users then
need to opt-out of. This should be reversed, especially given the m any ethical concerns people have over AI use. Users should be able to
opt-in and otherwise use software without the AI without the need to take additional steps to protect their data and avoid using AI.
Com panies that train AI on artwork, im ages, and written works should pay for the rights to those works and creators should be
com pensated or able to refuse for their works to be used in training AI.
