General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is a stain on our ability for future developm ent. It's a technological dead end with severe hallucination issues that will
never be overcom e, and a drastic environm ental im pact that m akes the car industry blush. As som eone who works in a creative industry
full tim e, AI has been a nightm arish inclusion to have to deal with. 
We should m ake this actual waste of resources illegal, it does not serve our country nor does it serve our citizens. The united states is
weaker with artificial intelligence running. As som eone who loves our country, I am  begging you to do whatever you can to disable the tide
of this econom ic virus before it cripples our entire econom y. 
We stand at the precipice of a disastrous end to the united states' ability to function as a society, and the acceleration of that downfall is
AI's only perceivable goal.
