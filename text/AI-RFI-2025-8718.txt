General Comment
The idea that a com m ercial AI m odel trained on copyrighted data is som ehow fair use is an absolute farce. Every output of a com puter is
directly related to its source data, no m atter how convoluted the algorithm s you use get.
Com panies like Apple and Adobe have shown that using licensed data is possible. If X and OpenAI can't com pete without *m ass*
copyright infringem ent, then that's their own problem .
