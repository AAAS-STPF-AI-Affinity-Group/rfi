General Comment
There is a reason Microsoft and other com panies are backing away from  spending billions on AI.
We cannot throw away decades of work on copyright law to chase a technology that's already failing, and will fail further. Stop this
m adness; it's a dead end technology that will not pay back anyone.
I stand in opposition to these plans.
