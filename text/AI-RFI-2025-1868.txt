General Comment
AI infringes on copyright in its training data and requires greater regulation. This is very im portant. My own livelihood is at risk, and m any
of those I know of som ething is not done. 
AI should not be used so widely until its environm ental im pacts are m itigated. Right now it is bulky and inefficient and harm s both
individuals and the planet.
