General Comment
It is m y belief that it is a wildly disrespectful reach to train ai on the works of artists without their explicit perm ission. Currently certain
social m edia policies have left open too m uch room  in their agreem ents to allow for training data on im ages publically posted. Further,
even outside of this, ai com panies scraped the web for this content even when it was not posted under such m eans, from  the privately
owned websites across the internet. Please ban ai im ages from  being able to be sold or trained on this data, especially when it is so clearly
in violation of copyright and ibtained under deceptive m eans.
