General Comment
Major large language m odels (LLMs), also referred to as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to bolster their apparent futurism , depend on
unauthorized access to copyrighted m aterial to supply their training data. This is a flagrant violation of the rights of the writers and rights
owners of these stolen works. LLMs do not need governm ent protection - they need to be reined in and prevented from  unfairly profiting
off the works of Am erican authors.
