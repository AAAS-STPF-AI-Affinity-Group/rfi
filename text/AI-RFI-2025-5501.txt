General Comment
Am erica's "AI Dom inance" isn't worth destroying copyright law irrevocably even if the AI industry was capable of producing anything
m eaningful, which it isn't. It is a group of con m en and carnival barkers selling the Am erican people a Mechanical Turk that pretends to
create art.
LLMs are always prone to hallucination, and pouring billions of dollars and our entire cultural history into a m ulcher for the sake of som e
Silicon Valley snakes is an idea I reject whole-heartedly. The AI bubble is soon to burst, and if we escape with our cultural power intact,
shielded from  the grasping hands of Big Tech, that's worth celebrating. I urge all parties involved to reject this bill.
