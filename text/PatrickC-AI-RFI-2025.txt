I am messaging to list off reasons AI shouldn't be allowed to steal
- Misinformation:
AI has developed it's ability to make realistic photos, videos and audio contentOff of real people.
  People can use this to spread misinformation upon government officials,
Citizens, celebrities, branding, and more.   It would create doubt and paranoia to people and  
Cause wasteful use of time and energy such at court cases, data breaching, security and lackof control.
- It can affect jobsWhile AI can be used to help with certain utilities like data organizing, business strategies,
documentation,Medical, Law, Government records, Translation, and even Transmission.
  AI can also affect
creative works such asPhotography, writing, art and design, selling goods and services, and more.
  AI doesn't have
the ability to think creativelyBut export information that is commanded from text.
  We need to maintain that ability to use
our minds and physical skillsTo acquire better attributes to things and maintain an expansive variety of jobs!
I understand we want to thrive with new tools and tech, But we have to know the right way to
use such things,We have to use it for the impossible, not for what is already possible.
