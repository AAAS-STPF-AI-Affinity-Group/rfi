NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION  
The Copyright  Alliance  appreciates the  opportunity to submit  the following comments in response  
to the request  for information  (RFI)  published  by the Networking and Information Technology 
Research and Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office (NCO), National Science 
Foundation  on behalf of the Office  of Science  and Technology Policy (OSTP) in the Federal 
Register on February  6, 202 5, requesting input from interested parties on priority actions that 
should be included in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan .1 
The Copyright Alliance is a non-profit, non -partisan public interest and educational organization  
representing  the copyright  interests  of over 2 million  individual  creators  and over 15,000 
organizations in the United States, across the spectrum of copyright disciplines. The Copyright 
Alliance is dedicated to advocating policies that promote and preserve the value of copyright, and 
to protecting the rights of creators and innovato rs. The individual creators and organizations that 
we represent rely on copyright law to protect their crea tivity, efforts, and investments in the 
creation and distribution of new copyrighted works for the public to enjoy.  
The Copyright Alliance  commend s the National Science Foundation, the OSTP, and each federal

2 agency involved in the Administration’s coordinated effort to ensure that America’s AI dominance 
is sustained and enhanced  through the promotion of human flourishing, economic competitiveness, 
and national security. We, along with a diverse group of other stakeholders, have been actively 
involved in the U.S. Copyright Office ’s and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s (PTO)  studies on 
AI and will continue to engage with these offices as those studies progress . As the expert U.S. 
intellectual property  (IP) agen cies, we hope that both the Copyright Office’s and PTO’s  insights on 
the intersection of copyright and AI will inform the development of the AI Action Pan.  
The Copyright  Alliance  supports  the responsible,  respectful, and  ethical  development and  use of AI 
technologies and a  thriving and robust AI economy . An AI ecosystem that meets these criteria is 
one that (1) values and respects the rights of creators and copyright owners and the importance of 
the copyrighted works they create and (2) does not make those rights and works subservient to the 
interests of A I companies. Many of our members are  already using or plan to use  generative 
artificial intelligence (GAI)  to aid in the creation of a wide range of works that benefit society, and 
some are themselves developers of GAI technologies.2 We submit these comments to ensure that 
the AI Action Plan is developed with a respect for and recognition of longstanding copyright laws 
and policies that make America the global leader in the creative and digital industries . 
Respecting Established Copyright Laws Promotes Human Flourishing, Economic 
Competitiveness, and National Security  
The RFI asks for input in response to President Trump’s Executive Order “ to establish U.S. policy 
for sustaining and enhancing America's AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, 
economic competitiveness, and national security. ” (emphasis added). Promoting human flourishing, 
economic competitiveness, and national security are all objectives that run parallel to the goals of 
America’s copyright system, enshrined in Article I , Section 8 , Clause 8  of the Constitution. Known 
as the “IP Clause,” it grants Congress the power “to promote the progress of science and useful 
arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective 
writings and discoveries.”  IP laws, including copyright laws, are what enable human authors to 
2 These comments focus on how the AI Action Plan addresses issues related to generative artificial intelligence (GAI), 
the development of which often involves training models on preexisting copyright protected works and generating 
material that acts as a substitute for the ingested works. The Copyright Alliance takes no position on more traditional 
AI technologies that do not train on preexisting copyrighted works.  


3 create and innovate, and they are key to securing American sustained economic competitiveness 
and global leadership. It is essential that the AI Action Plan be developed with an appreciation for 
the Constitutional guarantees that protect copyright owners a nd the human  creators without whom 
GAI systems would not exist.  
Existing U.S. copyright laws , as detailed further below, are carefully balanced to provide essential 
protections along with important flexibilities —a deliberate rubric that must not be altered for AI.  
From broadcast content , film and TV shows,  and journalism to sound recordings, works of visual 
arts, books , and everything in between, the ingestion of copyrighted protected works for GAI 
training is one of the central controversies related to the development of GAI technologies. 
Whether the unauthorized inges tion of copyright protected works for training constitutes copyright 
infringement or whether it qualifies for U.S. copyright law’s fair use exception is an issue that has 
become the focus of nearly forty ongoing federal lawsui ts, and it’s one that will and should 
continue to be decided on a case -by-case basis. Federal courts have been applying fair use for over 
a century , over the course of  various  technological advancements like the photocopy  machine, the 
VCR, the Internet, digital music services, and many  other new technologies. Courts are capable of 
applying fair use  to novel questions surrounding disruptive technologies, and they are best 
positioned to do so with GAI. Thus, there is no need at this time to change copyright law or create a 
new AI exception in the law. This is not just the view of a broad consensus of the copyright 
industries, it is also the view of numerous  GAI companies, and the diverse industry groups that 
represent them .3 There are many areas related to AI where the Administration may feel the need to 
take action to help facilitate U.S. world dominance in AI, but copyright is not one of those areas.  
We are concerned that proposals that would alter long -standing and balanced copyright laws would 
have the effect of obligating creators to unfairly subsidize the development of GAI .

4 Promoting Economic Growth and Good Jobs  
While AI is predicted to be a significant contributor to the economy, the contributions of U.S. 
creative industries —made possible through copyright law —have been one of the most significant 
contributors to the U.S. economy and to job creation for decades. A recent report on the economic 
impact of copyright by the International Intellectual Property Alliance notes that, in 2023, the core 
copy right industries contributed more than $2 trillion to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) 
(accounting for 7.66% of the U.S. economy) and employed 11.6 million workers (or 5.43% of the 
workforce).4 In addition to growing at a rate more than three times that of the rest of the economy, 
the report notes that the core copyright industries:  
(1) make up an increasingly large percentage of value added to GDP; (2) create more and
better paying jobs than other sectors of the U.S. economy; (3) grow faster than the rest of 
the U.S. economy; (4) contribute substantially to U.S. foreign sales and exp orts, outpacing 
many industry sectors; and (5) make significantly large contributions to what the [U.S. 
Bureau of Economic Analysis] defines as the digital economy, which does not even 
encompass the full scope of the copyright industries’ digital activitie s.5 
Copyright industries are an invaluable asset to the U.S. economy because the exclusive intellectual 
property rights afforded by copyright incentivize investment in the creation and dissemination of 
new expressive works and allow copyright owners to recoup that investment. The U.S. continues to 
be the world leader in IP—an attribute that contributes significantly to this country’s vast cultural 
influence and its standing as the world’s leading economy. The AI Action Plan must take into 
account the effect pol icy actions may have on copyright’s importance to the economy and job 
creation.

5 Promoting  Free Markets Through Copyright Licensing  
Promoting  free markets and  a robust voluntary licensing  ecosystem is essential to ensuring 
American competitiveness in GAI.  Copyright law enables creators and copyright owners  to supply 
GAI companies with flexible and responsive solutions for  training  through  tailor ed licensing and 
business models for GAI development. The ability of creators and copyright owners  to create 
works and enforce their rights in those works is crucial  because it incentivizes the further creation 
and proliferation of high -quality creative w orks which form the basis for GAI development. 
Without  copyrighted works  to train GAI models , GAI technologies cannot  generate high -quality 
output s. The growing number of licensing and partnership deals between GAI companies and  rights 
holders being reached with each passing day  demonstrates these points .6 
Since the rise of GAI technologies a few years ago , the number of free-market licensing agreements 
between copyright owners and GAI companies has grown significantly . Increasing numbers of 
copyright owners, particularly news, magazine, and academic publishers and image/media licensors 
are licensing their copyrighted works to AI companies for commercia l uses and have been doing so 
for many years.7 This shows that the market is working and there does not need to be any change 
in copyright  law or policies that could disrupt that market . Copyright and GAI can continue to 
progress successfully together without changes to copyright law.   
While t he GAI-copyright licensing market has grown over time, this growth will be stunted if 
changes to copyright law were made that create new exceptions for GAI training .8 Nobody disputes 
that GAI companies and developers must pay for and invest in computer chips and cloud 
infrastructure. It is part of the cost of doing business  in a free market . So, too, is free -market

use of copyrighted works include those launched from or created by Authors Guild, Created by Humans, Dataset

Corp, The Atlantic, Vox Media, Dotdash Meredith, Fo rtune, Time, Entrepreneur, The Texas Tribune, and 
WordPress.com.  
8 Proposals to change the existing legal framework will undermine the market for responsible GAI collaborations by 
creating a  strong incentive for GAI developers to wait for a new legal environment where working in good faith with 
copyright owners  is not necessary or beneficial for their bottom line.  


6 licensing of  copyrighted works . To think otherwise would be detrimental to American economic 
competitiveness , in light of the fact that strong copyright laws can and already have been shown to 
foster AI innovation  as it form s the basis of competitive AI products , not to mention copyrighted 
work s’ own, direct benefit to the American economy and balance of trade with foreign nations.  
No policy should be adopted in response to GAI that interferes with  the free market and the 
freedom of copyright owners and GAI companies and developers  to enter into licensing 
agreements.  The marketplace should continue to properly value and incentivize creativity, and 
policies developed through the AI Action Plan  should not interfere with the right of copyright 
owners to choose whether to license, or not to license, their works for GAI purposes.  Copyrighted 
works provide immense value to GAI developers, and they can and should pay for that value —as 
many are already doing  today . In other words, copyright law sets the conditions for the market to 
prevail  and for the U.S. to maintain its posit ion as a global leader in  both the  AI and creative 
industries .  
The Trump Administration has said that it wants to approach AI regulation with a “light touch,” but 
when it comes to copyright  and GAI licensing markets , we urge a “no touch” approach.9 However, 
if the Administration does address copyright and GAI issues, the one area for a “light touch” 
approach would be transparency surrounding  what copyrighted materials are used to train publicly 
available GAI models  when those materials have not been licensed for training purposes.  
The Need for Copyright Transparency  
Developers of GAI models that are available to the public and ingest without a license the 
copyrighted works of third parties should be required to satisfy transparency standards related to 
the collection, retention, and disclosure of the copyrighted works they use to train  GAI models . 
Adequate  transparency  regarding  ingestion  of unlicensed copyrighted  works  is vital to  ensur ing that 
copyright owners’ rights are respected  alongside the advancement of GAI technologies .

regulation -emerging -tech-policy/402592/ . 


7 Best practices from corporations, research institutions, governments, and other organizations that 
encourage transparency around GAI ingestion already exist  that enable  users of AI systems or those  
affected by its outputs to know the provenance of those outputs .10 There is no reason these same 
responsibilities should not also apply to GAI ingestion of unlicensed copyrighted works.  It is vital 
that GAI developers be required to maintain adequate and proportionate records of copyrighted 
works they neither own nor license that were used to train the GAI and to make those records 
publicly accessible and searchable as appropriate . 
Adequate and appropriate ly scoped transparency and record -keeping requirements benefit 
copyright owners by enabling them to learn whether and how their works have been used to train 
AI models, and benefit AI developers in  that transparency promotes consumer trust . Consequently, 
transparency by businesses that offer  GAI systems to the public is a crucial component of any AI 
policy.   
Protecting and Promoting Copyright Is Crucial to Identifying Trade Barriers and Ensuring 
American Global Economic Competitiveness and Leadership  
The global protection of U.S. intellectual property is an imperative part of developing an AI Action 
Plan that will ensure U.S. economic competitiveness and sustained global leadership, and it’s a 
principle that the first Trump Administration championed.11 Unfortunately, the development and 
deployment of GAI in foreign markets has created barriers to trade  that put U.S. copyright owners at 
a disadvantage. These barriers have most frequently arisen in the form of broad copyright exceptions 
for GAI in some foreign countries  that fundamentally weaken copyright protection and threaten the 
sustainability and competitiveness of America’s creative sector and its ability to contribute to U.S. 
economic growth  and job creation. The Copyright Alliance and our members  oppose such broad 
exceptions .  
10 E.g., CONTENT AUTHENTICITY INITIATIVE, https://contentauthenticity.org/  (last visited July 6, 2023).  
11 For example, in 2020 the Trump Administration issued Artificial Intelligence for the American People , which 
reaffirmed the President’s commitment to protecting intellectual property  in the AI environment, stating: “[t]he United 
States has long been a champion and defender of the core values of freedom, guarantees of human rights, the rule of 
law, stability in our institutions, rights to privacy, respect for intellectual property , and opportunities to all to pursue 
their dreams. ” (emphasis added). T he first Trump Administration also rejected attempts to weaken copyright 
protections in the US -Mexico -Canada Agreement (“USMCA”).  


8 To overcome these barriers , we urge the Administration to champion the rights of American creators 
and copyright owners and support the protection of copyright globally through  bilateral and 
multilateral engagement that advances human -centric and responsible GAI, promotes free markets 
and licensing,  and ensures recordkeeping and transparency.  Particularly as the global AI race 
progresses , there will continue to be worldwide efforts  to find unethical and unfair shortcuts in the name 
of progress, including  measures which weaken and undermine copyright. If shortcuts are utilized without 
regard for IP rights , it will cause a global race to the bottom. We have already seen challenges to IP 
protection  come up in the context of newer GAI technologies being developed in China.  
America’s IP laws, including our robust protections for our creators and innovators, is what sets us apart 
from China and other countries that unfairly circumvent or weaken copyright owners’ rights. Strong IP 
and copyright protections are ultimately what give the U.S. an advantage over those countries, and if we 
neglect those principles our advantage will be lost. This is why it is crucial now more than ever for the 
Administration to have an AI Action Plan that respects and promotes intellectual property ri ghts, 
including copyright. Specifically, we urge  oppos ition to  broad copyright exceptions and support active  
engage ment  with countries and international organizations to instead promote strong copyright 
protection s.  
One such broad exception that is being considered in some countries is an “opt out” system through 
which copyright owners could exclude their works from future GAI training datasets. We urge the 
Administration to oppose any opt -out proposals, whether in the U.S. or abroad . U.S. copyright law 
is unequivocally an “ opt-in” regime , and a llowing a GAI system to use work s unless the copyright 
owner affirmatively objects (i.e., opts out) would require enactment of legislation. As noted above,  
there is a burgeoning  licensing market for AI training, which is fostered by copyright law, 
demonstrat ing that no AI exception is necessary. Thus, the copyright industries and many others  
would vehemently oppose any policy or change in the law that establishes or supports an opt -out 
regime, like the ones adopted by the EU . 
Additionally, opt -out scheme s fail to consider the practical difficulties of implementation. For 
example: (1) many copyrighted works have likely already been copied and used for training prior to 
any new  opt-out regime ; and (2) despite opting out, copies of the copyrighted works may still be 
included in GAI datasets through other means, such as when copies are scraped from other sources 
such as from a licensee of the copyright owner , a third -party platform , or a piracy site  where a copy 


9 has been posted  without authorization . The practical effects of opt -out, particularly with regard to 
works already used to train GAI, are also negligible given that it is challenging to remove entire 
works at scale from a GAI model.  
While some proponents claim that existing technical solutions may assist with opt -out, these tools 
typically have significant limitations because they are only effective to the extent the opt-out 
mechanism  is recognized and respected, and because these tools are often not designed to be 
targeted to address scraping for GAI ingestion.12 Copyrighted works also often exist in multiple 
places  on the internet that make it near ly impossible for a copyright owner  to apply  the opt -out 
indicator to every copy of a work. For example, a single song can be streamed on a digital 
streaming platform, played as the background music of a user uploaded video on a social media 
platform or in advertisements, or displayed as notes or lyrics on a website. It is impossible for th e 
copyright owner  to successfully opt out in a way where every single downstream use would be 
tagged with the proper  recognized an d respected  opt-out signal to prevent GAI scraping and use.  
The current discussions on this issue in the context of the EU AI Act clearly demonstrate that no 
workable opt -out mechanism currently exists or is likely to exist in the future.   
Moreover, copies of works that are available on pirate sites are even further removed from the 
copyright owner’s control, and it is well -known that some G AI companies have used pirated copies 
of creative works to train their AI models and have even proliferated pirated copies themselves 
during the GAI development process.13 An opt -out regime fails to address or ameliorate any of 
these problems and certainly does not afford the copyright owner  any semblance of control. For 
these same reasons, there is currently a high level of uncertainty over what constitutes an effective 
opt-out,14 and as time passes this uncertainty is being exploited by some G AI developers who 
12 Robots.txt protocol is one example. While robots.txt does alert scraping tools not to ingest the associated copyrighted 
work, it has significant limitations because it is only effective to the extent it is recognized and respected, and it was no t 
designed  to be targeted to scraping for generative AI ingestion. Robots.txt may also prevent a search engine from 
indexing the work. A copyright owner may want their work to be scraped for search engine purposes —so they can be 
found on the internet —but not for AI ingestion. Even if robots.txt is used, it does not attach to the copyrighted work 
itself but will operate at the URL or website level.

in sum, opt -out does not and will not wor k.  
Conclusion  
When  formulating a new AI Action Plan , it is essential to respect the rights of creators  and 
copyright  owners  and whether  and how they  choose  to exercise  their intellectual property rights.  
Likewise, the Action Plan should acknowledge the adequacy of existing copyright laws, respect and 
support the  flourishing free market for licensing , and require transparency for commercial GAI 
developers  that used unlicensed materials to train their models . Finally, the U.S. economy, to which 
the creative industries are integral contributor s, should be secured by the promotion, protection , and 
enforcement of copyright glo bally.  
We appreciate  the opportunity to  submit  these  comments , and we are happy to  answer  any 
additional questions.
