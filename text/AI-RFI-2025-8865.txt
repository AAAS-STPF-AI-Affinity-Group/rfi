General Comment
“Generative AI” is an overhyped dead-end of a technology that steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. If your
business can’t function without stealing from  the Am erican public, you don’t have a business. You have an illegal operation begging the
governm ent to allow it to steal. If OpenAI and other AI com panies can m ake m oney by stealing copyrighted m aterial, why can’t I?
Where’s m y right to break the law?
Add to this the fact that there is no proof that AI will ever reach the m agical heights that com panies like OpenAI prom ise are around the
corner — seem ingly just a bit further around the corner year by year. In fact, exponentially increasing costs and am ounts of data are
leading to dim inishing returns in the im provem ent of this technology and any sort of usable results. There is no gold at the end of the
rainbow. It’s a scam .
Generative AI has no place in Am erica’s future. It will be abandoned as an overhyped dead-end technology within a few years, and its
purveyors are lying to the Am erican public. Do not give these com panies perm ission to scam  the Am erican people.
