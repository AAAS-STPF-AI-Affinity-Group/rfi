General Comment
Literally nobody wants AI. People put their hearts and souls into creating works of art, into literature and graphic design, they put in sweat
and tears and feelings and effort. Things are already bad enough for artists, especially the ones who rely on paid com m issions for
necessities. Letting AI steal everything, chew it up and spit it back out in a m ishm ash of worthless nonsense is only going to m ake things
worse. It will flood the m arket with garbage, and it will convince people that effort and passion and hard work don't m ean anything. I am
an artist m yself, I draw as a hobby for m yself and m y close friends because it m akes m e happy. And seeing these worthless com puter
program s that LITERALLY NOBODY WANTS is tainting that. It's tainting a hobby that's helped m e form  real personal connections
with people, sharing our work and spreading joy. AI is the com plete antithesis of creativity, anyone can pick up a pencil and learn to
draw. AI is theft, plain and sim ple, and it's a tax on the world's resources that hum anity cannot pay. Nobody wants AI. nobody wants
their hours, days, weeks, years of hard work and practice and effort and love for their projects to becom e m eaningless and cheap and
exploitable. Nobody wants AI.
