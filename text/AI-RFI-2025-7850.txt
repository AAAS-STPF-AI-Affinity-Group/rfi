General Comment
I teach university students and write peer-reviewed scientific papers. Both of these fields have suffered im m easurable harm , degradation,
and pollution from  generative AI.
I have had to adapt m y assignm ents to work around the pervasive “cheating m achine” created by widely available AI text generation, and
I see younger students struggling to write and feeling pressure to let AI do the thinking for them .
As an academ ic, I see the m anuscript subm ission and peer-review process harm ed by m eaningless, worthless, but plausible-sounding slop
churned out by AI. This wastes the tim e of reviewers and editors, and is already sneaking into som e journals at an alarm ing rate.
Add in the fact that m ost of the content used to train genAI is stolen/copied without perm ission, and it becom es clear that there is no good
justification for allowing these com panies to continue their project of theft in order to sell valueless, thoughtless slop to consum ers who
can’t be bothered to think for them selves.
