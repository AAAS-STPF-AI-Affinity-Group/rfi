General Comment
AI is absolutely useless. It's a waste of energy. Have you all never used a chatbot and noticed how it's just an am algam ation of the
inform ation that's fed into it. We already have the internet and hum an experts that can give actually useful answers. To replace them  with a
chatbot is utterly destructive to the United States. In fact it would seem  that nearly all federal initiatives lately are aim ed to weaken and
destroy the United States, m y hom eland.
