General Comment
I believe the harm  that would be done to Am ericans by weakening the rights they have to their own intellectual property would be m uch
greater than any good that could com e out of the developm ent of generative AI products. This technology is experim ental at best and I do
not see a future in which it will becom e m ore crucial to our society than the right of a creator to decide who can or cannot use their work.
Please reconsider the execution of this decision so that legal protection of intellectual property is not infringed upon.
