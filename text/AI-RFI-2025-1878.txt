General Comment
I am  strongly opposed to the technology currently referred to as generative "AI" because it is not intelligent or useful in any way; it is a
process for creating sentences that don't m ake sense and have no concept of accuracy, polluting the internet with m isinform ation, and
polluting the planet by wasting disproportionate quantities of resources. While sim ilar technologies that use specific datasets to narrow
down efforts m ade by actual hum ans can be extrem ely helpful and even life-saving, there is no place for generative form s iterating poor-
quality "content" from  stolen data. As a writer and artist, I find it offensive that this is still being m arketed as a useful technology.
