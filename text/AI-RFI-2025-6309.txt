General Comment
I do not want random  ass people to scrape our world for the beautiful art to m ake garbage that benefits no one and m assively harm s those
around the plants where they churn out this slop. It harm s the environm ent and the people by forcing the local power plants to over supply
just so it can function. It takes power away from  people who m ay need it and harm s the nature around us.
