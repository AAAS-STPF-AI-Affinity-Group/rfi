General Comment
Please do not allow OpenAI to train on copyrighted work. This is essentially theft. OpenAI does not have a good track record for honest
actions.
They didn't create this value and they should not get such a m assive free handout. They have no m echanism  to give credit to the original
creators. This is a m assive blocking point on the ability for creators to benefit financially from  their own work.
