3 INTRODUCTION  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been acknowledged  as being of strategic importance to the 
nation’s future economy and security. With the rapid adoption and integration of AI throughout 
our lives at work and beyond coupled with the global competition for AI supremacy, it is vital 
that the US government wo rk with academia and industry to establish priorities, policies, and 
programs to continue and expand the track record of American success in advancing AI and to 
further secure our position as a leader in AI innovation . 
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, national security, 
and economic competitiveness, necessitating a strategic investment in AI education and 
workforce development, research, and high -performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. To 
main tain leadership in this critical domain, there is an urgent need to cultivate a highly skilled 
workforce by integrating AI -focused curricula, hands -on training, and interdisciplinary research 
opportunities, particularly for educationally and economically d isadvantaged populations. 
Additionally, advancing AI research requires access to cutting -edge computational resources, 
robust data infrastructure, and collaboration across academia, industry, and government. 
Strengthening HPC capabilities is essential to s upport complex AI models, enhance simulation 
and analytics, and accelerate innovation. This response to the RFI addresses Tennessee Tech’s 
capabilities for establishing “U.S. policy for sustaining and enhancing America’s AI dominance” 
through best practice s and opportunities in AI education, research, and infrastructure 
development to inform policies and investments that will drive sustained progress in AI and its 
applications throughout the nation, starting in Tennessee and the South . 
EDUCATION AND WORKFO RCE DEVELOPMENT  
To strengthen our nation’s AI workforce, we suggest four policies/initiatives:  
1.Implement a Scholarship for Service program for AI ;
2.Encourage the development of industry and government -endorsed AI certificates ;
3.Support interdisciplinary AI education efforts;  and
4.Incentivize more interaction between academia and industry.
In support of these initiatives , TnTech has started implementing several key educational and 
workforce development programs.  
AI-Corps  
Starting in the Fall of 2023, TnTech began  piloting an AI -Corps program focusing on workforce 
development in Artificial Intelligence by enhancing the educational, service, and research 
experiences of undergraduate and graduate students. This program  is informed by TnTech’ s 


   
 
  4 
 highly successful CyberCorps SFS program ( https://www.tntech.edu/ceroc/education/sfs/ ) and 
seeks to enhance both the curricula for TnTech’s CS concentration in Data Science and Artificial 
Intelligence (DSAI) and provide additional experiential learning outside of the classroom.  
With the goal of increasing the number of qualified students entering the artificial intelligence 
workforce, the objectives of the TnTech AI -Corps program are to:  
1. Expan d and improve the campus’s learning experiences in artificial intelligence;  
2. Enhance AI -Corps scholars’ knowledge and skills through a program that values 
participation in education, research, and service;  
3. Provide AI -Corps scholars with real -world experienc es through summer internships; and  
4. Assess the performance of an SFS -like program that integrates education, research, and 
service in artificial intelligence.  
A key component of an effective artificial intelligence program that can produce ready -to-work 
graduates is a continuous sustainable culture to engage students in hands -on AI practices 
outside of the classroom. AI -Corps scholars work with a faculty mentor to develop an annual 
professional development plan that is reviewed periodically throughout the y ear, including such 
things as anticipated courses, research plans, and service activities.  
Under the auspices of TnTech’s new Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MInDS) Center 
[www.tntech.edu/minds ), with the financial support of TnTech and the Cybersecurity Education 
Research and Outreach Center (CEROC) ( https://www.tntech.edu/ceroc/ ), this pilot program 
currently supports 3 undergraduate students and 1 graduat e student, and all of the AI -Corps 
students have:  
✓ Organized and participated in multiple outreach events, including introducing AI to students 
from multiple high schools and hosting hackathons;  
✓ Participated  in a group artificial intelligence research proje ct; 
✓ Attended an AI conference where they were able to meet leading researchers in the field, 
and 
✓ Procured summer internships in the field of AI at four different major corporations in the 
U.S. 
Our goal for this pilot is to provide a proof of concept  that demonstrates the effectiveness of an 
AI workforce development strategy and a supporting infrastructure that is informed by our 
existing cybersecurity workforce development programs. The AI -Corps scholars are already 
showing a level of experience and maturity that will position them well in the AI workforce. We 
feel that this pilot, coupled with our CyberCorps and DoD Cyber Service Academy (CSA) track 
record, uniquely establishes Tennessee Tech as being at the forefront of AI workforce 
development and future scholarship for service programs.  We believe that expanding similar 
programs throughout the region and the nation can help to create a workforce capable of 
sustaining and enhancing America’s AI dominance.

 AI and Data Science Education and Workforce Development in Rural Communities  
The existing landscape of AI workforce development faces significant challenges and gaps that 
hinder its capacity to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving digital economy. One prominent 
challenge is the shortage of individ uals with specialized skills in AI, including proficiency in 
programming languages, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms [ 1]. This shortage 
is exacerbated by the fact that the field of AI is constantly evolving, necessitating ongoing 
train ing to keep pace with technological advancements and emerging best practices [ 2]. 
Bridging these gaps requires collaborative efforts among educational institutions, industry 
stakeholders, and policymakers to facilitate lifelong learning opportunities for A I professionals 
[3]. We are proposing an approach that will demonstrate an AI workforce development 
approach that bridges some of the gaps between academia and rural communities.  
Rural regions often benefit from community -academic partnerships. Tennessee T ech (TnTech) 
is located in the rural Upper Cumberland region, where one county is considered economically 
distressed, six are considered economically at -risk, and in contiguous counties, there are three 
more distressed counties. Currently, TnTech is involv ed in a Grand Challenge called Rural 
Reimagined , whose purpose is to transform rural living through harnessing science, technology, 
and economic development ( https://www.tntech.edu/grand -challenge/ ). The overall goal of 
this program is to establish a project -based framework that improves both the recruitment of 
students into AI as a career as well as the education of students and rural communit ies about 
the potential benefits of AI. The main objecti ves of this program involve the following:  
1. Establish sustainable community -academic partnerships that provide students access to 
relevant, real -world AI projects that will assess the AI readiness of both students and rural 
organizations.  
2. Develop reproducible curricula, modules, and assessment tools that improve AI workforce 
development by providing students with foundational AI knowledge  regardless of their field 
of study . 
3. Diversify the experiences of students from underserved rural commun ities through the 
incorporation of real -world, locally impactful projects across multiple disciplines and high 
schools.  
Our approach provides an educational framework, including courses, modules, and projects, 
and their benefit to the students and the rura l community. We assess our approach to learning 
AI and the overall impact of providing an AI workforce ready to tackle problems in rural 
communities.  
Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Career Readiness Certificate  
The growing demand for expertise in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) across 
industries underscores the need for a specialized certificate program that equips students of all 
backgrounds with essential skills in this rapidly evolving field. As organizations increasingly rely 
on d ata-driven decision -making and AI -powered solutions, there is a critical shortage of 
qualified individuals who can develop, implement, and ethically manage these technologies. A 


6 certificate program in data science and AI can provide structured, hands -on tr aining in key 
areas such as machine learning, data analytics, and computational modeling, ensuring that 
participants gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. This certificate will be 
particularly valuable for individuals seeking to enhance  their current expertise to meet 
workforce demands. By offering a focused curriculum tailored to industry needs, this certificate 
will help bridge the skills gap and create a pipeline of talent ready to tackle real -world 
challenges in AI and data science.  
Currently, TnTech employs a Gold and Purple Career Readiness Certificate, based mostly on the 
National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Competencies, for both 
underclassmen and upperclassmen. The program is designed to help students ide ntify where 
their skills are being developed and how to better communicate those skills to employers. This 
semester, TnTech is rolling out a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Career Readiness 
certificate that requires a student to complete tasks in 4 areas:  
✓Data Science Skill Building
✓Artificial Intelligence Skill Building
✓Field Experience in AI and Data Science
✓Extramural Activities in AI and Data Science
To further support the efficacy of this certificate, as well as other certificates in artificia l 
intelligence across this nation, there need to be government and/or industry -managed  
accreditation mechanisms that will allow for easy and fast approvals of certificates. Doing so 
will make it easier for institutions to be on the forefront of educating t he next generation of AI 
workforce development.  
Graduate CS Education to Align Soft and Technical Skill Development with Industry AI 
Workforce Needs  
Graduate computer science students today face a myriad of challenges as they prepare to enter 
the workforce , particularly in an industry characterized by rapid technological advancements 
and evolving skill requirements. One notable challenge lies in the ever -widening gap between 
the theoretical knowledge imparted in academic programs and the practical skills th at 
employers demand. This disconnection often results in graduates lacking the necessary 
storytelling experience and industry -specific competencies, leaving them ill -equipped to 
navigate real -world scenarios effectively [ 4]. Additionally, the fast -paced na ture of the field 
necessitates continuous learning and adaptation, as well as a demand for interdisciplinary skills, 
such as communication and teamwork [ 5]. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic 
approach that integrates practical experiences, fosters collaboration between academia and 
industry, and emphasizes developing industry -relevant technical and soft skills among graduate 
students.  
A typical graduate computer science education consists of courses, seminars, projects , and/or 
research. The majority of Master’s degree  graduates in computer science do not continue in 
academia, opting instead to go into industry [ 6].  However, most institutions provide a more 


7 research -focused education, in which topics and material are aligned wit h faculty research 
agendas, are more theoretical, or focus purely on technical skills. For this effort, TnTech is 
developing an industry -focused, real -world use-inspired project experience in artificial 
intelligence, with a focus on teamwork and soft skill s, with the goal of producing candidates 
who are more workforce -ready. With the guidance of industry and communication educators, 
we are leveraging an existing industry engagement with our undergraduate program capstone 
course and piloting a new Master’s l evel concentration that provides practical and industry -
relevant AI learning experiences. The main objectives of this program are:  
1.Creating a new graduate -level course in Professionalism in Artificial Intelligence for Industry.
This new graduate -level cour se introduces students to soft skills including teamwork,
communication, and mentoring, as well as project management and ethics as it pertains to
AI project work.
2.Modifying the Project Component of the non -thesis option exposes students to more soft
and t echnical skills opportunities. This provides the student with AI expertise, as well as
experience acting as mentors to undergraduate students on their senior capstone project.
3.Adding more soft skills experiences to existing AI courses. In addition to the n ew course and
working on undergraduate capstone teams, students in this concentration are required to
continue to work on their communication skills as part of other activities.
RESEARCH  
Regarding research, we suggest the following two policies /programs : 
1.Incentivize the development of techniques that promote and support responsible and
trustworthy AI, including large language models and other generative AI ;
2.Promote innovation at the intersection of AI and critical infrastructure ; and
3.Fund and govern the  safe development of applications that utilize recently developed AI
methods to competitively advantage the nation
Researchers at Tennessee Tech are working in all of these areas.  
Responsible and Trustworthy AI  
We need a solid understanding of what it means for AI to be both responsible and trustworthy  
and how those aspects impact human -AI interaction.  Research ers at Tennessee Tech work in at 
least four areas related to this area : eXplainable AI  (XAI), uncertaint y quantification (UQ) for 
machine learning models, model fairness, and secure AI.  
A shared understanding of the importance of responsible and trustworthy AI is vital to the 
adoption of AI, especially in areas of critical infrastructure.  Furthermore, we ne ed a robust set 
of tools and techniques to assess AI along these two dimensions and to enable improvements in 
these areas.  


   
 
  8 
 We have multiple efforts in these important areas , including the following:  
• Understanding the impact of model fairness and explainab ility on model trust  in 
healthcare ,  
• Supporting s ecure and autonomous vehicle operations in a zero -trust environment,  
• Understanding the role of UQ in determining where a model is strong or weak,  
• Developing a model for improving policies related t o the management of complex 
machine learning models,  
• Understanding and mitigating model trust issues caused by model compression,  and 
• Developing models for responsible use of generative AI in fields such as software 
development.  
It is important for the go vernment to define issues of responsible and trustworthy AI as 
national priorities and allocate funding to support work in these areas.  
Interdisciplinary research combining AI and critical infrastructure  
Developing safe, impactful, and novel ways to apply AI to support critical infrastructure is of 
vital imp ortance to our nation. Such applications could improve this infrastructure through 
improving its security, providing additional i nsight into its design and operation , and improving 
its efficiency  and eff ectiveness .  
Numerous researchers at Tennessee Tech are actively pursuing innovative  applications of AI to 
support critical infrastructure.  
• Cybersecurity : Cybersecurity continues to be a critical  component for the safety and 
security  of both public and private sector assets. AI is key to the effectiveness of 
cybersecurity. This is a large and active area of work among faculty in both our Machine 
Intelligence and Data Science (MInDS) Center and our  Cybersecurity Education, 
Research , and Outreach Center (CEROC).  
• Emergency Services : Time -critical decision -making is a challenge continually faced by 
emergency service personnel. Investing in how to best bring AI-driven decision support 
in such environmen ts is an important and challenging task. In research funded by NIH , 
we are looking at helping first responders make more accurate decisions through the 
use of trustworthy machine learning tools.

availability of food, i mprove its quality, and decrease its cost.  At Tennessee Tech, 
agriculture faculty a re partnering with CS faculty to work in the area of smart farming.  


   
 
  9 
 • Healthcare : Skyrocketing costs and the ever -increasing complexity of healthcare and 
healthcare delivery necessitate  the adoption of AI to support healthcare  providers.  
Researchers across campus are working on projects like applying AI to develop better 
joint replaceme nts and studying how to apply AI to provide just -in-adaptive decision 
support for college students struggling with anxiety and depression.  
• Manufacturing : Manufacturing is another area that is benefiting greatly from the 
application of AI to improve its pro cesses. Multiple researchers in our College of 
Engineering are working through our Center for Manufacturing Research (CMR) to 
advance the field of smart manufacturing, i ncluding efforts to make it more secure, 
more automated, and more efficient and effecti ve. 
• Water : Additionally,  the management of water, both in support of human life and in 
protecting humans from disasters such as floods, can benefit from the use of AI.  Faculty 
in our Center for the Management, Utilization , and Protection of Water Resources  are 
working to apply AI to better manage and monitor water by applying machine learning 
to cha llenging problems such as flood prediction.  
• Practical and Impactful LLM Applications:  A research team focuses on understanding 
and applying large language models.  In concert with researchers at the University of 
North Carolina in Asheville , the team is studying the application of LLMs to the 
preservation of the Cherokee  language. They are developing LLM -based adaptive 
assistants through game environ ments. Finally, they are developing an LLM browser 
extension to make the internet more accessible to those affected by the digital divide. In 
addition to these efforts, they are working to fundamentally understand the cognition of 
LLMs. The team’s overarch ing belief is that the broad utility of LLMs is still largely 
unrealized, and they hope to change that.   
 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INFRASTRUCTURE  
Investing in research and development programs to enhance high -performance computing 
(HPC) support for AI is es sential. While efforts in this area existed prior to the establishment of 
Tennessee Tech’s Advanced Scalable Computing, Extreme Networks & Data (ASCEND) Center, 
the Center is significantly amplifying and advancing these initiatives. ASCEND is addressing 
critical challenges in HPC by conducting cutting -edge research in scalable systems and network 
architectures tailored for AI workloads.  
• Better Algorithms for AI : HPC research at the boundaries of energy, efficiency, 
programming models, new architectures, an d better algorithms for AI are essential to 
the national interest.  
• Open Science : While resources at the Exascale level will be invested in nationally by 
NSF, DOE, and others to support open science, resources at multi -Petascale at regional 
and state levels  are also needed with research in computer science, systems, algorithms, 
and methods to enhance AI emphasized, rather than just production applications based 
on AI.  
• Multidisciplinary Research : Multidisciplinary research in advanced computer 
architectures t hat go beyond exascale and go beyond current CPU+GPU models is 


10 needed.   These investments in design and prototyping, likely in conjunction with  NSF, 
DOE, and DOD, are needed to drive beyond Exascale and to begin to pay attention to 
the extreme energy costs  of AI currently.  
•Investments in Testbeds : Investments in AI that bridge HPC/Supercomputer with Cloud,
Edge, and AI are important  to enabling optimization of the use of AI in contexts relevant
to people, critical infrastructure protection,  and experimental  automation.   These
investments should include regional and local  testbeds.
•Access to HPC and Cloud : In order to support the combined goals of workforce
development, education, research, and outreach, it is important for there to be broad
access to signifi cant AI resources at the HPC and Cloud level across institutions of higher
learning.   These have to be free or inexpensive to use and access in order to enable
deep and broad use in classrooms  and other training and learning contexts.
•Hardware Standards : The current dominance of a few vendors (e.g., NVIDIA) in the AI
hardware space has displaced important standards for scalable computing and
programming with vendor -specific approaches.   Investments in national and
international standards that transcend vend ors and vendor -lock will be important to
achieving performance portable, open science applications, and open -source software
of enduring value to drive modeling and simulation infused with AI, as well as AI
applications that are stand -alone .
ASCEND  is exploring AI -assisted programming techniques to optimize parallel computing, 
ultimately improving efficiency and performance. By fostering innovation at the intersection of
