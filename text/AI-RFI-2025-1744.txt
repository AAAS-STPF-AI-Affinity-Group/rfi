General Comment
Get bent on that AI executive order. If innovation requires breaching the law and treating creative work as m ere grist for the m ill, then the
innovation is illegal and should not be pursued. It's no different than if a cure for cancer required feeding orphans through a bone grinding
m achine, or if furthering the car econom y required badly-justified foreign wars for the sake of obtaining m ore oil. Anyone with half an
ounce of respect for this country's laws and basic hum an decency would reject the proposition outright.
