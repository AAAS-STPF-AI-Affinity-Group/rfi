General Comment
The blatant theft of original ideas and content is illegal and wrong. The overall unsafe developm ent of generative AI is bad enough without
the added disregard for ownership of ideas and copyright laws. I strongly oppose the bending of will of the governm ent to private tech
corporations in the accelerating developm ent of dangerous unregulated technologies.
