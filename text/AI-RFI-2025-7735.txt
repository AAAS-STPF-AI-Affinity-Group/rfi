General Comment
absolutely unacceptable. com panies need to be held MORE accountable for their actions, not less. This especially applies to a delicate
topic like LLMs and generative language m odels. As a student graduating soon in the field of AI software engineering, there is nothing
m ore dangerous to the general landscape of ai related concepts than giving m ore leniency to the com panies involved in it. You need to be
cracking down on them  HARD.
