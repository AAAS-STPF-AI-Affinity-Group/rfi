General Comment
Do not m ake developm ent of AI easier â€” there need to be m ore barriers for those developing it. It im proves by stealing the work of
hum ans and AI serves no actual benefit. I want protections from  AI com panies so that they will not steal m y data, photos, or written
work. There needs to be m ore regulation around AI.
