General Comment
This is a terrible idea that m ust not be allowed to pass. It would legalize the continual theft of the works of m illions of artists, to feed
system s that only serve to im peril or replace hum an jobs and destroy the concept of creativity. The AI industry, as it is, is also the latest
toy of Silicon Valley which they force upon everyone despite nobody wanting it, and which the the forces of capital m ust be boosted so
that they reap the financial benefits. You want to im prove governm ent efficiency? Why not tell Sam  Altm an and his friends that they can't
just hook them selves up to the governm ent spigot and dem and a trillion dollars for som ething that if they actually tried to innovate on,
would only cost m inuscule fraction of their asking price.
