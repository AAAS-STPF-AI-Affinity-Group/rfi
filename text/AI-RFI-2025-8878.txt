General Comment
To keep it sim ple: allowing tech com panies to exploit any and all written, visual, audio, etc. work with no consequences will destroy so
m any industries across the country. The technology isn't worth the m oney it costs or the power it uses. These tech com panies need to
focus on som ething that's actually useful and sustainable, not these wasteful, unethical nonsense generators.
