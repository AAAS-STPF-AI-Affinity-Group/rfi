For the United States to assert dominance in the field of AI, we need a level of ethics, 
transparency, and accountability that are far lacking right now. Really, we cannot lead the world 
in any field if we canâ€™t even lead ourselves in the way our constitution intended. The actions of 
the DOGE are undermining our stature in the world, and making us look like complete manic 
fools on the world stage. We have unelected, twenty -something party -boys up in our government  
offices, with access to the personal sensitive information of our people. Who in their right mind 
would trust that kind of government to have control over widely used AI?!
