As a concerned citizen, it's important to me to put basic restrictions and requirements on AI so 
that the United States nor its citizens be taken advantage of by it in unfair ways: namely, 
financially. With this in mind it would be right to restrict AI 1) from having a social security number 2) from being given personhood status 3) from being able to directly receive any income or compensation 4) from being able to be issued an ID from any state or federal government. These IDs should be reserved for people. It would also be prudent to include some requirements. AI must be accountable in it's actions, decisions, conclusions in certain basic ways. The issuing entity (company or individual(s)) must be held accountable for damages that will occur. Therefore an AI must be attached to (identified by) the issuer in order for recourse for certain damages that individuals or companies incur. This is to say that the issuer should be able to be held liable instead of the AI, so that the AI is not given personhood status. AI does not have a limbic system. It does not experience anger, resentment, revenge, love, empathy or sympathy in a real way. Nor can it procreate. It should not be able to be a human being in the eyes of the law. Let's put and keep basic, prudent restr ictions and requirements in place.
