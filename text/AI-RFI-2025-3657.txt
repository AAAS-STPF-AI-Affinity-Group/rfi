General Comment
This is so stupid, copyright laws apply to individuals but not big tech? This is only going to result in the death of art posted online while
letting com panies get by with never hiring another creative ANYONE, while vastly increasing resources spent to fund these abom inations.
Legitim ately the only thing that will benefit from  this is the top 1% getting bigger wallets.
