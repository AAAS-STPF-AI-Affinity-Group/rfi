General Comment
Artificial intelligence is a threat to hum an nature if taken too far. It has caused the m edia and arts industry to go through a huge
em ploym ent problem  with even the m ost talented of people having trouble finding work. Even I after graduation have not been able to find
work within m y field. Artificial Intelligence only steals from  the hardworking people, there should be no reason why stealing work of
others to feed this m achine should be legal. Even so, it goes against the rights of the people who create the work that AI feeds off of.
I im agine that there will be plenty of lawsuits, not just from  the individual, but com panies as well.
