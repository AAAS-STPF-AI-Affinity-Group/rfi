General Comment
Generative AI has no place in the world, and deser ves no legal protect ions from cop yright law. It is trained by scrap ing content from 
creators that, in many, MANY more cases than not, did not consent to having their creations used in such a way. It then hacks 
together  what is more often than not an uncanny, &^% result, using disg ustingly excessi ve am ou nt of energy and water in the 
process. It's a tool  that talentless hacks th ink they can use to replace actual artists with reg urgitated garbage made from content 
stolen from those sam e  artists. The only people advocati ng for its widespread use are greedy assholes who think artists don't 
deserve pay. It is a form of theft that  produces valueless resu lts. If copyri ght laws as they are do not allow it to ex ist, then so be it. 
Let it die.
Additional ly, AI has no place in the future of the US. If AI were put to use in national security, I would bet everyth ing I own that the  
results would be disastrous. ChatGPT lies all the ti me. It scrapes ideas from everyth ing it can find, and a lot of the people it imitates 
arequite frankly  stupid. You can easily convince it to say whatever you want. I once saw the AI overview on google advise som eone
to kill them selves. All the decent results people get from  generative AI have dozens and dozens of worthless, scrapped outputs behind
them . I do not trust this technology at all, especially in m atters of security.
