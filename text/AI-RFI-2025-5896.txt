General Comment
I am  opposed to a rule that would shield the com panies developing AI m odels from  accountability for their egregious and wanton
infringem ent of others' copyright and intellectual property generally. These com panies do not own nor license m any of the works used for
training, and have shown no concern for the laws they've tram pled in their race to develop tools that are at best, deeply, fundam entally
flawed. They should not be protected from  the rule of law, and certainly not after having already flaunted it for years.
