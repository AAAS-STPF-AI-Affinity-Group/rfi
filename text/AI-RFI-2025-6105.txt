General Comment
I work as a freelance illustrator. In the m odern m arket the only way to spread m y brand and find work is by m aking a large collection of
this work available only for public viewing. AI is quite literally stealing m y intellectual property and using it to enrich a com pany by feeding
it to their AI algorithm  so that it can produce work which will in m any cases replace m ine. This is also true for m any other artists.
AI cannot think. It is not producing creatively distinct work from  the creators it steals from . On occasion AI is even known to produce
work that features im m ense likeness or even the signature of certain artistsâ€™ work.
Allowing OpenAI to utilize the works of artists, writers, and casual internet content creators everywhere is an afront to anyone who has
ever given their heart and soul to the world expecting nothing in return. It is a slap in the face to the charitable individuals who saw fit to
m ake our days a little brighter by offering their genuine and uniquely hum an works, perverting and twisting these works by feeding them  to
a m achine that will warp and regurgitate these works for the profit of a corporation who will not reim burse or benefit those hum ans in any
way. Please do not let com panies win out over hum anity.
