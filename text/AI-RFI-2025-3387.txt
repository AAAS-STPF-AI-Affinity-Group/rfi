General Comment
By giving PRIVATE, PROFIT-MOTIVATED com panies with zero ethics unrestricted freedom  to develop AI on unauthorized m edia is
an excellent strategy for con-m en and dupes. This AI arm s race is futile and pointless. This punishes individuals, devalues m edia as
culturally and com m unicatively im portant. It is bad governance. But we have never been known of good governance. This is anonym ous
for m y privacy.
