General Comment
The developm ent of AI should be done ethically and this plan does not ensure that. The m yriad problem s of AI are well-evidenced in
scientific research. AI replicates and am plifies biases. LLMs and GPTs in particular are inaccurate and unlikely to adm it when they cannot
find and answer. AI should not be trained on copyrighted or other protected m aterials (thatâ€™s theft). AI consum es m assive am ounts of
energy and thus, its use should be balanced against its social and environm ental harm . This com m ent is a plea to exercise restraint and to
conduct a thorough ethical analysis of any AI research, product, and application. In other words, it is a plea to carefully regulate and
m itigate harm .
