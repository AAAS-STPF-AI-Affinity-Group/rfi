General Comment
Regulation helps prevent boom  and bust cycles. AI is no different.
Artificial intelligence is a threat to everyone's privacy, which is already being invaded at an alarm ing pace. The com panies that are m ost
interested in this have already shown that they are grossly unethical. AI requires far too m uch energy that will poison everyone. It can also
be used to m ake disturbing im agery, such as the video of Trum p sucking Musk's toes. 
AI is prone to bias, even on very arbitrary things like addresses. Their own designers also cannot properly explain how the system  reaches
its decision. It can also easily be weaponized by crim inals and terrorists. 
Artificial intelligence displays poor judgem ent and hum ans can easily lose control of it. 
The drawbacks outweigh the benefits. IF artificial intelligence is going to be used, it needs to be carefully controlled.
