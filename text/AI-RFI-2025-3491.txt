General Comment
As an artist, designer, and sm all business owner, allowing AI com panies to scrape the internet of content and profit from  it directly
com petes with and puts m e out of work by stealing m y own product for gain. I urge lawm akers to consider the im pact this has on tax
paying citizens and whole industries at risk by allowing this ram pant theft to be left unchecked. Please resist the push of powerful
corporations that want to profit off stealing the work of hundreds of thousands of artisans across the globe.
