General Comment
hi. i'm  a digital artist and anim ator just trying to m ake cool art and get paid to do it. however, letting people m ake generative ai from  OUR
WORK and call it "fair use" is gonna m ake that so m uch harder. the whole point of art is allowing PEOPLE to express them selves and be
creative, putting their hearts and souls into what they m ake. this generative ai slop can try to RECREATE art, but it will never com pare to
the real people m aking real things. last tim e i checked, ai can't be creative if it doesn't have a soul. what you're allowing people to do with
whatever m otion you're trying to pass is take our hard work and passion, feed it into an algorithm  that regurgitates a disgusting
conglom erate of other people's creativity, and pass it off as som ething only hum an beings can m ake. you're letting people who don't care
about artists capitalize on us, and it's just sad.
