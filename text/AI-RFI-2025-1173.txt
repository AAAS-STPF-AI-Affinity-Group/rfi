General Comment
My nam e is Marshall McCall, and I am  a graduating senior from  Avonworth High School who has spent the past year studying the ethical
im plications of AI in creative industries, particularly in creative writing. Through m y research, I have explored how generative AI
technologies can change artistic processes, including issues related to authorship, copyright, and originality. I believe the AI Action Plan
should create clear rules that encourage innovation while also protecting the rights of hum an creators. AI has the potential to m ake content
creation m ore accessible, but without proper regulation, it could harm  creators' ownership of their work and increase inequality in the
industry. Based on m y findings, I strongly support regulations that prom ote transparency in AI-generated content, ensure fair
com pensation for artists, and prevent m onopolistic practices that could lim it diversity in creative fields.
