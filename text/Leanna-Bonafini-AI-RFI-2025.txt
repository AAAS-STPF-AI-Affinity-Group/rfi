Hello,
My name is Leanna Bonafini and I live in Massachusetts. I am reaching out regarding the
proposed policy to "enhance AI dominance," with which I strongly disagree. My colleagues inthe arts have expressed alarm over the ability of AI to steal their work without credit andreplace their jobs, costing them their livelihood. My fellow consumers and I avoid using AI atall costs due to the rampant misinformation and devastating environmental impact. I urgeagainst this change.
Thank you,
Leanna
