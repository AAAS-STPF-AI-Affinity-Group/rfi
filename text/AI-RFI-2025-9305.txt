General Comment
AI needs m ore regulation. Not less.
The am ount and source of data fed into AI is highly concerning as it essentially uses a com puter algorithm  to perm anently store and
regurgitate inform ation akin to a high schooler using copy/paste to write an essay then changing a few words. The copyright im plications of
AI are incredibly concerning as well. I strongly oppose com panies using m y inform ation and copyrighted works **for free** to create an
algorithm  that will be used for m onetary purposes.
