General Comment
Are you insane? 
We already have a m assive m isinform ation cam paign after cam paign happening everywhere and you want to just feed that beast MORE?
How m any states do we have to burn down? How m uch water do we have to waste before you give an inkling of care for the world? 
I put m y heart and soul into everything I draw, I do it as a hobby, and you want it to be free to steal from  m e and do whatever it wants
with it? If one car dealership went and stole parts from  20 other dealerships to m ake their cars wouldn't that be illegal? So, why do you
think it's ok to steal from  photographers? From  artists? From  writers? 
We spent so m uch tim e creating copyright laws and you just want to throw all of that away because you think you're getting in on the
schem e before it crashes out. It's already been proven that AI costs m ore to m aintain then the value it's m aking back, and this is not to
m ention the backlash from  everyday people.
This is a disastrous idea. I think you know that, but do you even care?
