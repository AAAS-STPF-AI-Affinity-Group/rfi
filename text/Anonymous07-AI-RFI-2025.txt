To legalize the push for AI to openly access public works is predatory and allows
irresponsible businessmen and corporations to infringe and capitalize on artwork and literaturethat has taken every individual creator extensive labor and heart to create. Not only does thisrisk professionals but also regular citizens that create for themselves and enjoyment for others.To allow such a plan any approval strips any moral value to all creatives that are just trying toget by. It is all for scam and if passed will lead to an incredible destructive ripple to everyonefacet of business that thrives on creative freedom and cause fear to anyone that wants topublish their works in any internet media.
