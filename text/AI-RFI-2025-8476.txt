General Comment
Giving any extra power to AI, especially pertaining to Governm ent power is waiting for a dam  to blow open and let nothing but crim e
break through.
There is nothing good that can com e from  this kind of developm ent and it should not com e to light. If there's any hope for a future that isn't
ruled by ram pant m isinform ation and m isuse, please don't let this com e to power.
