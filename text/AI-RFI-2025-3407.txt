General Comment
AI is a plagiarism  m achine, and the use of it is deeply unethical.
And if you don't care about that, AI is also extrem ely bad for the environm ent.
And if you don't care about that, AI is sim ply bad at what it does. It's an over-exaggerated next-word guesser. It has a trem endously high

And if you don't care about that, then you're a fool.
