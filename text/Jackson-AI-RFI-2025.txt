I believe certain AI tools in areas such as data analysis or physical simulation can be quite useful. 
I pers onally am very against increased investment and development of generative artificial 
intelligent tools or large language models. The product of these programs covers no new ground, and are incapable of pushing its content past what exists in its training data. I am against AI companies profiting off of uncompensated works from authors, journalists, photographers, or visual artists.
