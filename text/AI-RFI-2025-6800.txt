General Comment
OpenAI is not the benefit that com panies are trying to claim  it is. It's a program  that has to steal copyrighted m aterial in order to work,
and they should NOT have the free ability to do that. It can't generate its own work without stealing, so it's not worth it. It's nothing but
expensive, m oney-wasting slop. I am  fully against this, period.
