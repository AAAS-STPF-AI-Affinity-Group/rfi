General Comment
Allowing for AI without restraints to plunder the nations resources without recourse to Am ericans would violate their constitutional rights
and freedom s as well as destroy Am erican businesses.
Allowing AI to exist without rails would not only im pact copyright law but patent law as well. This would not only negatively im pact
Am erican artists, businesses, and corporations (as anything Am erican corporations and lobbyists fight to protect would be fair gam e as
well), but also the econom y. 
Allowing AI to operate as desired would have the opposite effect on national security as well as access to secure files both civilian and
private and m ilitary to train would allow a backdoor for other countries to penetrate and access files and concepts and m ore of the nations
various m ilitary and security system s.
These com panies that operate these AI m odels do not care about the country or its interests. They will say whatever they need to in order
to get what they want. They just want unrestricted, unregulated, unanswerable power and access the what m ages Am erica great: the
m inds and creative efforts of its peoples, businesses, inventions, and technology. Do not let them  have it.
