General Comment
I work in com m unications and worry that if AI is not properly regulated, bad faith actors will take jobs from  hard working Am ericans
through AI for ultim ately worse productivity and lower quality work. Iâ€™d prefer AI focus on m aking life and our jobs easier in white collar
office environm ents.
