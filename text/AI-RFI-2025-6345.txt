General Comment
No. Just no. This is a further attem pt to by private com panies to use private and/or copywrited inform ation for private financial gam e. Iâ€™m
com pletely against this rushed proposal. If Congress holds hearing and develops a proposal that has better protections for copywrite
holders and for private data in general, Caongress m ay be able to develop reasonable legislation on this topic.
