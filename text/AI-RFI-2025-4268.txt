General Comment
I have worked in graphic design for several years. Changing the way copyright works to coddle generative AI m odels is a double
standard for hum an artists and opens their work up to theft by these com panies. Additionally, what if a com pany that prints shirts or other
m erchandise is given AI assets that are influenced enough by a copyrighted source im age that the original artist has grounds for a C+D or
a lawsuit? Restructuring copyright to benefit AI would put the onus of com panies like m ine to vet stolen assets generated by AI while the
com pany that stole the art wouldn't be liable. This change benefits no one but the AI com panies and I urge you not to give them  special
treatm ent
