Re: National Science Foundationâ€™s Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
As a self-taught artist, as a crafter, as an artisan, I've honed m y work over decades. It's m y love and life and business. I expect anyone
who wants to use m y work to contact m e to state intent and ask for perm ission, while accepting m y response. "AI" certainly would not do
that. No perm ission has been or will be given to scrape m y work to train algorithm s that pretend creativity when their true purpose is to
steal and rem ix with no intent, no effort, no heart. It's an insult on top of thievery.
Technology, like any tool, is as good as the people using it, as good as what it's used for. I'm  seeing an art-stealing, environm ent-ruining,
soul-sucking endeavor that continues to pretend it's profitable while destroying the intellectual property and livelihoods of the people it's
stealing everything from . Doesn't particularly speak highly of the people designing or using it, frankly.
Thank you for the opportunity to com m ent.
