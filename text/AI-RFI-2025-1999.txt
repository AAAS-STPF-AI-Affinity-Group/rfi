General Comment
The space we're calling "Artificial Intelligence" is a dangerous path to walk. Focus should be held on Large Language Models being used
to identify sickness, disability, and other m aladies within the hum an body as opposed to chat bots and im age generators, which only serve
to devalue, replace, and dim inish hum an ability.
