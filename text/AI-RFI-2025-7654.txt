General Comment
Walter Elias Disney, better known as Walt Disney, a lover of the Am erican fam ily and the Am erican dream  who dream ed of people going
to the Moon before it happened and going even further beyond that would be deeply asham ed at this proposal. This goes against the
values this adm inistration upholds. This is also terrible for the econom y as AI has lost com panies billions of dollars. Most consum ers don’t
want AI, it’s truly bad for the econom y. I cannot state this enough and I urge you to not go through with em bracing AI as it will harm  the
shareholders and others who deserve to have all the m oney too. AI is blasphem y, a sin, a abom ination that Jesus Christ and God would
never want to see in Heaven.
