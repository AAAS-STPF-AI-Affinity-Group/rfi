General Comment
As a concept artist and illustrator who now has to com pete with generative AI that is trained without consent on m any creative individuals'
work, I strongly oppose the theft of our copyrighted m aterial by Google and OpenAI.
It is im possible to support "hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness, and national security" without protecting the individuals who
m ake hum an flourishing possible (i.e. real people, not algorithm s).
It is im possible to protect "econom ic com petitiveness" by destroying the rights of all artists to appropriate their creative work.
There is no "national security" if the people who produce the wealth of our culture are not protected from  the predatory actions of Google
and OpenAI.
You m ust choose to protect each individual creative artist against the theft of their work by corporations whose sole purpose is the
centralized control of hum an endeavor in order to m axim ize their own bottom  line. The profits of corporations like Google and OpenAI
m eans the annihilation of what is critical to our hum an survival- the protected free expression of individual thought and action.
