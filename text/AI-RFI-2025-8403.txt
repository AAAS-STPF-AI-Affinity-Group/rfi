General Comment
I believe Ai should be heavily regulated, it is a new technology and there are few laws in place to regulate it. The privacy of every
Am erican is at risk with the proposed legislation, and should not be called to a vote.
Any congress person who votes shall vote against deregulation of new technologies, Am erican children will be at great risk with how few
laws are in place against ram pant and unregulated ai m odels.
As a concerned citizen, I heavily encourage congress to think of the Am erican children. Not doing so is an abdication of their official
duties to this country.
