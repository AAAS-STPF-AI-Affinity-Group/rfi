General Comment
Generative AI steals m assive am ounts of existing, copyrighted art and writing for its m odels without perm ission. Many AI m odels allow
you to generate im ages that m im ic the style of existing art or writing. This is clearly infringing on the m arket those artists and writers
provide, and AI scraping and im itating their works should be considered a breach of copyright.
