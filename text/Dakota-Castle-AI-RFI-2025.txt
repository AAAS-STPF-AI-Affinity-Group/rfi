AI is great at certain things, and like most technology, is used for a lot of bad too. The
development of ai tech has in no way been slow, however. I do not believe these restrictions tobe "unnecessarily burdensome," either.
 
    This proposal is a threat to our nations copyright law, and at the very least should be
reconsidered. Copyright has always been a major catalyst for innovation, and without it, wemay begin to quickly fall behind. Why should a company develop a new technology just foran ai to steal it?
 
    The same worry is there for our people. Creativity and innovation thrives off of the
connections people make with eachother. AI scraping discourages this. This will undoubetedlydisrupt the growth of the next generations leaders
