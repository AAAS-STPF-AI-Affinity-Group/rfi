General Comment
Sorry for using language, but F&^% don't. I mean th is not in a place of rage or an ger. But as a parent watching their ch ild about to  
put their hand into the chocolate fondue fountain at a bu ffet. Youre going to make a mess, its going to hurt, and th ings will be better 
if you stop for ONE second and th ink about your actions.
