General Comment
Generative AI is a flawed and dysfunctional technology that is built on plagiarism  and theft of copyrighted m aterial and does im m ense
dam age to the environm ent as part of its basic operation. It's also presented and m arketed in wholly inaccurate term s, convincing people
and corporations alike that it has utility that it does not have and m ay never have. Giving this technology the legal cover to operate outside
the bounds of current copyright law, without any regulation of its environm ental im pact, would cause severe dam age to the natural world
and our culture.
