General Comment
I can't claim  to be the sm artest guy out there, but even I can see that allowing AI to take over our lives is going to be a very bad thing.
Now I'm  just a hum ble hobby artist, but the recent flood of AI generated content has been very discouraging, confusing, and infuriating. 
It's bad enough as is, but effectively nullifying copyright laws and allowing it to sim ply steal and use a person's work will only hurt the
people who are putting thought and care into their creations! The only people who want this are those who want to legally steal from
people.
WE THE PEOPLE DO NOT WANT THIS!!
