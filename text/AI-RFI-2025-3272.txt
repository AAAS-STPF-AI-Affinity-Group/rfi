General Comment
There is absolutely no reason why Generative AI should be exem pt from  this copyright rule, especially given that it uses the m aterial to
am algam ate barely passable products. Generative AI does not com e to conclusions based on the inform ation it steals, it can only
regurgitate. Generative AI does not create. Generative AI does not have im agination. It can only take. The use of Generative AI to
circum vent copyrighted m aterial should be considered a felony as m uch as large scale piracy.
