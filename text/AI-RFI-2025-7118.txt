General Comment
Generative AI (as opposed to predictive) trains itself by scraping copyrighted m aterial from  the Internet with no com pensation to the
creators; therefore, it is stealing our work (I'm  an author) and producing substandard, rote m aterials for profit.
This should not be allowed in any form .
