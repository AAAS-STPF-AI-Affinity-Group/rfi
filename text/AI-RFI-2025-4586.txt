General Comment
This is beyond the pale. If any of us norm al people were to decide that we were just going to wholesale harvest the entirety of the creative
output of the hum an race for financial gain, we'd RIGHTFULLY be locked away for a very, very long tim e.
What OpenAI is requesting is no less than the legal authority to steal whatever they want, without consequence. They are stealing from
ALL OF US. WE THE PEOPLE.
I am  a photographer by trade, and am  actually afraid of posting m y work online for fear that OpenAI, or one of its m any im itators, will
sim ply harvest m y life's work for their gain, leaving m e with nothing.
Where is our voice in any of this? Are you guys even going to listen to us little people?
OpenAI should be bound by the sam e laws as the rest of us. Nobody should be above the law.
Shoot down this ridiculous proposal, and protect our creative works!
