General Comment
Allowing AI to rem ain unchecked brings serious problem s to Am erica and its people. This will allow people to steal the hard work of both
private individuals and large com panies and also cause im m ense dam age to our strength as a country. Over reliance and indulgence of AI
will lead to a m entally weaker and lazier generation which is som ething we as a nation already struggle with. It will also cause irreversible
dam age to the internet by flooding it with unreliable im ages and m isinform ation, essentially destroying this wealth of knowledge that has
been incredibly im portant in providing inform ation and bring people together. Encouraging AI tech will only stall our progress as a society
and m ake our country weaker.
