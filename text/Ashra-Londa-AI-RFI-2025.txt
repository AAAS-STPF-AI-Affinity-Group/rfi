Hello,
My name is Ashra Londa and I am writing as an individual.My comments and concerns about AI Use are as follows:CopyrightAI is not following copyright rules at this time. This loophole does not recognize the copyright
holders whose items are being fed into AI generators. Such a trespass is highly concerning andshould be considered illegal.
Energy UseAI Generation consumes a large amount of energy. AI use should be regulated, moderated and
restricted with this issue in mind.
