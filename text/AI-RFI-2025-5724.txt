General Comment
As a creative both professionally and personally, I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica. My colleagues and I have
already seen the devastating effects this technology has - som e have been replaced at their jobs by an algorithm  that was trained on their
work (without their knowing and consent), while others, who work in the m edical field, have seen it integrated into their workspaces to
disastrous results. 
Generative AI in particular is built upon works stolen from  others: OPEN AI, ChatGPT, and the like scrape the internet for content to
train on without the consent or com pensation of the creatives who m ade it. This is a well-docum ented fact, adm itted by the heads of the
com panies them selves. They've been recorded as saying that their technology can't work without the things they've scraped, and they can't
afford to pay those they scraped from  for their work, and you know what? YEAH. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. IF YOU CAN'T PAY
FOR A GOOD, YOU DON'T GET TO HAVE IT. Ask m e how I know, and I'll show you m y bills com pared to the things I'd love to
have, but can't afford.
I get that the wealthy people in Washington don't care about us, but som e of us are barely m aking it as it is, financially. It has no benefit to
the future of Am erica, and has been widely unpopular in public opinion. No one wants this except the folks on top who benefit financially
from  stealing from  those of us on the bottom  - so please protect us from  it, please. Thank you.
