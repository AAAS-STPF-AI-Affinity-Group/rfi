General Comment
The idea of allowing AI to be im m une to and not subject to the sam e copyright laws that hum ans are subject to is extrem ely shortsighted
and ultim ately destructive. If this rule passes, then we would see any sort of artwork, any sort of intellectual property, from  sm all
independent artists, to large corporations would be swept up into this m assive, zero-actual-intelligence m atrix that provides no actual
insight but just random ly regurgitates prom pts with no concept of what or why it's actually doing. Whereas, all art, even from  well-known,
fam ous IP's like Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Nintendo etc. could be swept up in the sam e wide net. What guardrails would be put in place
for artists to opt out of this? Or better, what processes would be put in place to opt in? If this is just a wide, sweeping decision that is
being foisted onto any artwork, then where is the choice of the artist in how their art is used, represented or m onetized?
I respectfully disagree with the idea of im plem enting this change and I urge against this change in the interest of the choice of the artists, big
and sm all, who would be im pacted by this decision.
