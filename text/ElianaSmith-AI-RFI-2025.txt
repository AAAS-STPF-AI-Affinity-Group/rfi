I do not think AI will help America and may hinder progress. I am an artist but my family works mostly in tech. AI
delivers worse results and fixing all the problems created is the same about of work because people want this newthing to replace those workers. People already do more work for less pay and we should not continue that trend.Recent firings have shown the value of well trained knowledgeable people. AI is not intelligent it is a tool like allother tech it can mimic but it is a black box and its reliability is untested or shown to be bad. AI destroys jobs forhardworking Americans. It is already making it easier to scam people. AI appears to be another tech bubble and weshould not be putting all of our resources into one basket. AI is controlled by private companies that the people haveno say in and it is rife for abuse or sabotage. I donâ€™t trust AI and private companies to uphold our rights and valuesas Americans.
