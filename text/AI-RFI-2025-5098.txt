General Comment
I am  an US citizen, but am  com m enting anonym ously because of the recent actions of the governm ent wherein free speech is punished by
deportation and “disappearing”.
Generative AI that steals the work of others and destroys the environm ent is a scourge upon the world. Copyright law will not allow it,
there will be lawsuits, and the crash of Tesla stock is in OpenAI’s future. I will boycott all products using generative AI and if there is a
class action lawsuit, I hope it ruins Sam  Altm an and his cronies.
