To whom it concerns:  
I oppose the AI Action plan. I believe the United States can become an artificial intelligence
powerhouse, however they need to be a worldwide leader in AI while maintaining regulation.To be safely used by US industries and international collaborators, it needs to hold a high barof safe, trustworthy development and use of artificial intelligence.
 
Thank you for your consideration.
