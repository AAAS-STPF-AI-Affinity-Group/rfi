General Comment
Even if I did not have strong m oral objections to generative AI and how it is being used to disenfranchise and disem power hum an workers
while stealing their labor and using it to regurgitate slop, I would still not want it being used. The power and water needed to run a single
prom pt far outweighs any potential "benefit" of generative AI. Sim ply put, I don't want a com puter who is wrong half the tim e to think and
work in the place of a hum an.
