General Comment
The ONLY appropriate approach to AI is to draw a strong and unbreakable distinction between Large Learning Models and generative
AI, and to forbid generative AI entirely. Generative AI is theft, destroys the econom y, underm ines the integrity of businesses and pollutes
the internet. It has *less than zero value* and anything it appears to accom plish can be m ore effectively accom plished by hum ans.
