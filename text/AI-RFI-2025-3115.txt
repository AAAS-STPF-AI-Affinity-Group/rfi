General Comment
To not only allow but legally protect the continued pilfering of hum an-created art by billion-dollar AI corporations is a disgraceful and
utterly disrespectful stance to take against creatives and artists everywhere. If you have any hum anity left within yourself, you m ust put a
stop to OpenAI and their contem poraries. See past the dollar signs and take a stand against intellectual theft instead of rolling over like a
cowardly dog.
