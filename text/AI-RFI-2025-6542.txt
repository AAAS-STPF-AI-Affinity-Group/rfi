General Comment
It's patently absurd we are giving the AI industry the privilege to steal and ignore copyright laws and take other's ideas without any credit
or com pensation. We have these protections to help foster the growth of intellectual and artistic culture in our society and this blatant
disregard for those laws and protections is un-Am erican. Please, don't open pandoras box for these com panies to steal from  others in the
nam e of "developm ent".
