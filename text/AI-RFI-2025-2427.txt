General Comment
While analytical AI (such as is used in drug searches and m eteorology) is absolutely som ething the U.S. should be investing in, generative
AI (such as ChatGPT and Grok) is highly suspect.
Generative AI violates copyrights and ethics, replaces skilled workers, and floods the internet with low quality content.
I estim ate that I have lost $6-8k a year in incom e as a freelance content m arketing specialist since 2022, due to the com bination of being
replaced by AI and being falsely accused of using it due to poorly-coded "AI checkers" that false positive at high levels. I know people
who have changed careers because of this and I m yself am  pivoting to do m ore fiction editing work.
Generative AI also endangers the future of the arts, a key part of hum an endeavor; AI cannot produce quality creative work and denies
hum ans the pleasure and satisfaction of creating those works in the first place.
It wastes energy and CPU power, and threatens to disrupt the econom y in ways that m ay appear positive to business, but will ultim ately
be negative.
Please, when developing an AI plan, consider the basic fact that AI should be used to do well things that hum ans do badly, not do badly
what hum ans do well.
