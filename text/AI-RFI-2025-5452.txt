General Comment
AI should not get special treatm ent, by allowing it to usurp copyright protection for no good reason other than their profits, it would be
actively putting a private product above the law. AI has done nothing to earn this aside from  sim ply dem anding it. If a business cannot
exist or succeed without theft and exploitation of the am erican public, it does not deserve to do so.
To let it do so would be a clear bias saying that the copyright system  can not only be abused, but absolutely ignored if the person or
com pany in question has enough m oney or enough powerful investors.
It does not im prove public life.
It does not do its job even a fraction as well as its profiteers claim s.
Giving them  unprecedented access to whatever they wish to the benefit of no one but its stock holders, and in fact would harm  m any
m ore, would prove that such crim es are legal to the rich.
A m an had his life destroyed by Nintendo for m atters infinitesim ally sm aller in their transgression than this, the only difference being its a
com pany with leverage, and not a regular citizen.
