General Comment
It is already evident that generative AI is decom posing in quality and worth from  overuse due to it cannibalizing itself. This is a terrible
investm ent and a danger to the Am erican people as a whole, including those in the public eye since defam atory m aterial will be easier to
create. The high resource load to low value output m akes this unasham edly a terrible decision.
