General Comment
Copyright and patents are part of what not only fuels Am erican innovation, but play a key role in allowing any individuals with a great idea
to succeed. Allowing AI to be trained on copyrighted m aterial would be an awful decision that would continue to funnel power into the
wealthy technocrats that already wield unncessary, terrible sway in our society
