General Comment
AI plagiarizes intellectual property from  actual hum ans, be it visual arts or writing. The data centers needed to run the AI are m assive
contributors to the production of greenhouse gasses, cooling them  consum es a vast am ount of water, and they produce unrecyclable
waste that pollutes the environm ent. AI is also a threat to security and privacy by illegally collecting and aggregateing personal inform ation
to invade citizens privacy for the purposes of profiling and profit. All of this leads m e to com m ent that it needs to be tightly regulated in
order to stop it from  hurting people.
