General Comment
This cannot be allowed to stand. Copyright is just that—a RIGHT, that none but the originator of the copyrighted work m ay profit from  it.
This AI “developm ent” plan would grant AI com panies the blanket ability to plagiarize all copyrighted m edia and underm ine the m ost
basic fundam ental rights to PROPERTY as enshrined in the Constitution of the United States.
