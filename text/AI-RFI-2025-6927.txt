General Comment
Artificial Intelligence system s require strict rules to prevent the software and system s from  training, scrapping, and stealing the intellectual
property of hard-working Am erican citizens who have spent hours to decades refining their craft. Artists, innovators, creatives, engineers,
and the like have spent thousands upon thousands of hard-working dollars to invigorate the Am erican econom y and be seen as Am erican-
m ade, world-class artists.
AI steals the livelihood of Am ericans who have put in the work to copyright their works, and the Am erican public deserves to understand
the full weight of this decision. Let Am ericans Create and Be Great, Not Machines!
