General Comment
I am  a writer, healthcare worker, and first responder.
So-called "A.i." technologies like ChatGPT and Dall-E are based on the theft of m y work and the work of m illions of creators like m e.
So-called "A.i." text technologies like ChatGPT constantly present false inform ation as fact, spreading dangerous ignorance and
disinform ation. This is of particular concern to m e as a person who works in healthcare.
So-called "A.i." technologies like Dall-E allow the creation of fake im agery that enables dangerous political disinform ation.
So-called "A.i." technologies like ChatGPT consum e m assive am ounts of energy and water and endanger the environm ent.
My conclusion is that the current im plem entation of these technologies is im m oral and unethical and violates copyright law. These
technologies should not be encouraged, aided, used, or subsidized by the governm ent in any way.
One very specific suggestion is that a so-called "A.i." com pany should be required to obtain the perm ission of every single creator for
every single work it wants to use before it uses it, and the com pany should be required to im m ediately rem ove all work for which it do not
have such perm ission from  their databases
Thank you for your attention.
