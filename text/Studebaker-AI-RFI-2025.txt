Lucy Studebaker,  
My name is Lucy Studebaker and I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth 
High S chool. I completed a semester course on AI and Ethics and studied impacts of Generative 
AI on Catholicism. EO 14179 will improve Catholicism and will support a policy of education 
on the Catholic faith. Many AI platforms used to educate people on the Catholic faith, have been seen as both harmful and beneficial. An example of this is an AI chatbot known as The Father Justin App, which is used to educate users on Catholicism through questions and answers. The use of this chatbot caused confusion for some people and often replied with inaccurate information. Because AI chatbots are essentially mathematics and not ethics, it has created a fear for those exploring the Catholic faith. Catholicism opposes making any one person or thing above, or at the level of God, so using technology at the service of the church could be seen as a mockery of God. There are Artificial Intelligence platforms that are seen as safe and creating an exciting environment for the Catholic community. One that I have personal experience with is the #1 prayer app, Hollow, which provides the public with prayers, homilies, daily readings, and podcasts. This educates users on Catholic faith accuratel y and effectively, without the fear of 
misinformation. As said by Pope Francis, it is important to remember our hearts to not allow AI algorithms to replace what we truly believe in, which in this case is God. The EO 14179 will hopefully set apart the Catholic faith from Artificial Intelligence, in a way that can educate users without replacing true faith in God and taking away what we truly believe in the Catholic faith.
