General Comment
This EO violates constitutional rights. The Fifth Am endm ent to the Constitution provides that private property shall not be taken for public
use without just com pensation.
Allowing these com panies unlim ited access to intellectual property they do not own or pay for would irreparably harm  the econom y.
