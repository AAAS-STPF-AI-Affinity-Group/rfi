General Comment
Artificial intelligence is a very new technology, but its im plem entation has already proven to be disruptive and harm ful. A recent study of
ChatGPT has shown that it is m uch m ore likely to m ake up an answer than adm it it does not have access to solid data when answering a
question. Generative AI from  Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and other algorithm s is harm ing our arts and culture by flooding the internet
with sloppy, low quality im ages. Several online m edia outlets have laid off a lot of their workforce, preferring to use AI to generate articles
which often contain factual errors. None of this helps to im prove our country. AI is not the transform ative tool its proponents claim  it to
be. Things worked just fine before AI cam e along. I urge lawm akers to put a tight leash on this technology and to outright ban generative
AI in particular, which provides a service only by copying and regurgitating copyrighted works without the consent of their creators and
owners. We can find far better tools than AI to im prove the USA.
