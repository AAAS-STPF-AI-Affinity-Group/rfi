General Comment
As som eone working as a visual artist, I am  very frustrated that there's nothing being done to reign in com panies from  stealing our works
to Train their m odels.
It should absolutely be crim inal for them  to use these LLMs for profit when they had no right to integrate all the source m aterials they had
no right to use.
This does not help Am erica "flourish." It will just allow tech com panies to profit off of the work of others with im punity.
