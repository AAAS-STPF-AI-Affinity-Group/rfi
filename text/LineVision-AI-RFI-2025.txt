Poli cy ( OSTP) , the Networki ng and Informati on Technology R esearch and Development (NITR D) Nati onal Coordi nati on Offi ce (NCO) requested input on the 
D evel opment of an A rti fi ci al  Intel l i gence ( A I)  A cti on Pl an to defi ne the pri ori ty pol i cy acti ons needed to sustai n and enhance A meri ca’ s A I domi nance, and to ensure that 
unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper priva te sector AI innovation.  
Introduction

utilitie s  w ith m o nito ring s o lutio ns  fo r high -voltage transmi ssi on li nes whi ch can 
unlock as much as 40% additional capacity on existing lines through Dynamic L ine Ra tings  (DLR). Line Vis io n’s  no n -contact sensors and sophi sti cated analyti cs also

energy and A I domi nance. R eadi l y depl oyabl e i n mere months, D L R  wi l l  be a key tool  
for getti ng data centers connected to the gri d more qui ckly, as the gri d i s already 
capaci ty -constrained throughout much of the U .S.

B ackground  
The U .S. houses a vast number of data centers, whi ch feed power -hungry AI 
appl i cati ons, hel pi ng keep the U .S. the cl ear domi nati ng force i n A I devel opment. These data centers are dri vi ng massi ve l oad growth where they are bei ng devel oped 
and have already b egun to strain portions of the power grid. The ability for data 
centers to connect to the power grid is directly tied to the availability of capacity on the  grid . This  c a p a c ity, ho w e ve r, is  q uic kly b e ing e xha us te d .  


If the U.S. wishes to maintain its role as the world leader in AI, the power grid cannot 
be a barri er to the depl oyment of the key i nfrastructure that i s needed to power A I 
growth -  data centers. The advancement of A I wi ll only occur i f there are suffi ci en t 
data centers to support its growth. The grid is the infrastructure that powers these cri ti cal faci li ti es, and i f i ts capaci ty i s not qui ckly expanded, A meri ca i s at ri sk of falli ng 
behi nd i n the A I  race.
 
The  Challe nge  -  Data Centers Cannot Connect to the Grid Quickly Enough  
In October 2023, the U .S. Department of Energy published its National Transmission Needs Study, whi ch i ndi cated that i nterregi onal transfer capaci ty would need to i ncrease by 41 2% by 2035 i n order to accommodate a hi gh load growth future.
1 Sinc e  
then, forecasts for data centers and other large i ndustri al loads have only i ncreased. 
Beyond the energy supply needed to provi de power to data centers, gri d capaci ty 
must be avai lable to connect these data centers to the gri d i n the fi rst place. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) refers to this problem in terms 
of “sp eed-to-power” -  the measure of how fast a potenti al data center si te can 
access the electri ci ty needed to power i ts stock of chi ps.
2 As highlighted by CSIS, 
speed -to-power far outweighs any other factor in slowing the connection of new 
data centers: “A ccess to electri ci ty supply i s the bi ndi ng constrai nt on expanded computati onal capaci ty and therefore on conti nued U .S. leadershi p i n A I.”  G E Ts l i ke 
D L R  are a key tool  to sol vi ng the speed -to-power challenge on an already -
constrained power grid.  
There are three ways to materi ally expand transmi ssi on capaci ty: 1 )  get more c a p a c ity o ut o f e xis ting line s  thro ugh GETs ; 2) re build / re p la c e  e xis ting line s  w ith 
newer technology ( i .e., hi gh performance conductors)  wi th hi gher capaci ty levels, also known as  re-conductoring; and 3) build new transmission lines. Building new 
transmi ssi on l i nes, on average, takes 7 -10  y e a r s .  Re -conductori ng typi cally takes 1 8 -
24 months to complete. But deploying GETs to expand the capacity of the existing 
grid  -  such as D ynami c Lin e  Ra t in gs  (DLR) -  takes as little as three months.  
For the U .S. to mai ntai n i ts role as the world leader i n AI, a portfoli o approach i s needed, meani ng some of al l  of the above. New transmi ssi on capaci ty -  whether 
through newly -built infrastructure or simply getting more out of existing 
infrastructure usin g GETs  -  w ill b e  ne c e s s a ry to  s e rve  this  s ignific a nt ne w  lo a d

D ata centers can be bui lt and connected to the gri d i n a fracti on of the amount of ti me 
it takes to build new transmission infrastructure (usually 7 -1 0 years) . A ccordi ng to 
M cK i nsey, i n 2022, total U .S. data center demand was 1 7 GW3, which of course has 
only grown since then, but not at the clip experts are now seeing. Between now and 
2030, uti li ty esti mates show data center l oad growth that may exceed 90 GW.4 In 
other words, over the next si x years the U .S. coul d bui l d more than fi ve ti mes the capaci ty of data centers than exi sted i n the enti re country just three years ago. A I i s 
expected to represent 70% of that total growth in data center demand.
5 This  le ve l of 
demand growth will need not only new energy generation, but also new transmission 
capaci ty to handle i t.  
In order to connect to the gri d and operate, data centers need transmi ssi on capaci ty. 
U ni que as compared to other l oads, l i ke resi denti al  homes or 9 -to-5 businesses, data 
centers generally operate 24/7. These hi gh load factor faci li ti es are already putti ng  a 
strain on the grid -  a probl em that wi l l  onl y become more severe i f transmi ssi on 
capaci ty i s not added i n the near -term. A ccordi ng to Goldman Sachs, “data center 
supply — speci fi cally the rate at whi ch i ncremental supply i s bui lt — has been 
constrained over the past 1 8 months.” These constrai nts have ari sen from the 
ina b ility o f utilitie s  to  e xp a nd tra ns m is s io n c a p a c ity b e c a us e  o f p e rm itting d e la ys , 
supply chain bottlenecks, and infrastructure that is both costly and time -inte ns ive  to  
upgrade.6 
Wi th new data centers bei ng bui lt at a faster cli p than ever, these constrai nts wi ll only 
get worse. And wi th newly -built transmission usually taking 7 -1 0 years to plan, site, 
permit, construct, and begin operation, even if we were to cut that time in half , the 
U .S. will begin to lag in its ability to connect data centers. U sing technology solutions 
l i ke D L R  to expand the gri d’ s capaci ty needs to be part of the A I A cti on Pl an, whether 
through new incentives, requirements, or otherwise.  
The Solution -  D L R  i s Needed to G et M ore Out of the E xi sti ng G ri d  
A  key factor i n the avai labi li ty of transmi ssi on capaci ty i s based on the rati ng of a transmission line, which determines how much power any given line can safely pass through. H i stori cal l y, these rati ngs have used stati c measurements based on 
conservative  assumptions to measure that capacity. But in reality, the ability for a 
transmi ssi on li ne to carry less or more capaci ty i s based largely on how hot or cool

that line is. DL Rs measure ambient conditions, such as heating and wind, that heat up 
or cool down transmi ssi on li nes. D L R s calculate the real -ti me and forecasted 
capaci ty of transmi ssi on li nes by factori ng i n real -world condi ti ons, removi ng the 
his to ric a l  approach of relyi ng on those conservati ve assumpti ons. For example, DL R  
can i denti fy ti mes when there i s addi ti onal ampaci ty avai lable on a li ne, meani ng the abi l i ty to safel y pass through more power.  It can al so i denti fy ti mes when the l i ne’ s 
true carry i ng capaci ty has been overstated, posi ng an operati onal ri sk.  
D L R  has already shown the abi li ty to bolster transmi ssi on capaci ty by as much as 40% -  a huge jump, that, if operationalized, would allow the grid to accommodate 
i ncreased amounts of data center load that i t otherwi se cannot accommodate today. In a d d itio n to being deployed on existing lines to get more capacity out of today’ s 
grid, GETs like DL R can be a component of newly -bui l t transmi ssi on, as i t has shown 
the abi li ty to i ncrease the uti li zati on of new/upgraded transmi ssi on by an average of 16 % .

DL R can be deployed and sending data to utilities in mere months, quickly allowing 
them to determine where on the grid they can increase transmission capacity, in turn 
al l owi ng them to more qui ckl y get more l oads connected to the gri d. R ecogni zi ng the

A lack of time ly rule s  and re gulations  around GETs  will s low the ir de ployme nt. 
Policymakers have a vital role to play in ensuring that evolving regulation keeps up 
with evolving technology.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) 
inclusion of D L R in Order 1 920 -A and i ts 2024 Advanced Noti ce of Proposed 
Rulemaking (ANOPR) on DL R9 underscore the federal  government’ s recogni ti on of 
DL R’ s potential to cost- effecti vel y sol ve ever -inc re a s ing grid  c o ns tra ints .  
F ederal  and state enti ti es have a number of  pri ori ti es to bal ance when i t comes to the growth of data centers and l arge el ectri fi ed l oads i n general . These pri ori ti es i ncl ude fostering an environment to support economic growth, keeping energy costs 
afforda ble for all customers, and mai ntai ni ng a safe and reli able transmi ssi on and 
distribution grid. Potential action could include: 
 
○FERC:
■Advance the DL R ANOPR to a NOPR, expedite the implementation timelineso that i t can allow the U S to be AI -dominant; consider a requirement to
deploy DL R not just in grid -congested areas, but in states where data
centers are seeki ng to connect l arge l oads to the gri d.
■Ensure that FERC stays on top of Order 1 920 -A  compli ance wi th regard to
DL R evaluation and manages a reasonable implementation of the rule.

Conclusion 
If the U.S. is to maintain global leadership in AI, it can’ t do so without data centers, which in turn can’ t be built fast enough unless DL R is able to expand the capacity of
