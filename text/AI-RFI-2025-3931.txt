General Comment
Do not give tech com panies unfettered access to the hard work and skill of artists, m usicians, writers or the general public. For years,
every day citizens were warned against, fined, or taken to court for downloading a song or a m ovie and now it is going to be okay
because a Billionaire wants to do it? They can pay for the art/writing/m usic/research like everyone else.
