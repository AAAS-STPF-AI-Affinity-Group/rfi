General Comment
I've m ade art all m y life (I'm  59), paintings, m usic, and fiction. After looking into it, AI is theft, plain and sim ple. It violates all ethical and
reasonable bounds of copyright. I cannot fight these huge billion-dollar com panies, but they should not be able to take what they want
without paym ent, or accreditation. I expect they will be allowed to (as I have lost com plete faith in the United States of Am erica to do the
right thing) and that will be a sad day for us all.
