General Comment
the focus for developing AI should be as a supplem ental tool to aid hum ans in their work. AI should not be developed with the goal of
replacing hum ans. also, there needs to be STRICT regulations around preventing AI from  freely using m aterial protected by copyright and
other intellectual property protected by tradem arks, patents, etc. there is absolutely no future where it is acceptable for AI to steal the
work m ade by hum ans and replace them .
