Absolutely not. AI companies should demonstrate that they have a real product that does things besides plagiarism
and hallucinations before you consider anything along these lines and even then, no. It's a grift. A sham. People likeSam Altman are swindlers, through and through. Once this is done failing and crashing our economy based on howmuch we are wasting on it, he'll disappear into the ether with all of our money.
