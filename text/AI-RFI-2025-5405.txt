General Comment
AI does not hold a m eaningful purpose for the future of Am erica. In it's current im plem entation it is dependent on stealing inform ation and
content from  others with out their consent or knowledge. It's purely a quick cash grab from  tech industry leads who are trying to convince
others of it's supposed, and thus far unproven, im portance.
