General Comment
Generative AI violates the rights of artists and writers who have their work stolen and regurgitated by a thoughtless m achine. While AI can
be useful in m any areas of scientific research and data/pattern analysis, it MUST be kept out of the creative sector. Protect the rights of
creative workers.
