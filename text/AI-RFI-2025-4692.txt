General Comment
Going through with this m eans flagrantly ignoring the rights of the Am erican people. If the private sector is granted freedom  and im m unity
when it com es to developing AI, copyright and intellectual property will becom e m eaningless, and gross violations of such will run
ram pant. This isn't in the best interests of the people.
