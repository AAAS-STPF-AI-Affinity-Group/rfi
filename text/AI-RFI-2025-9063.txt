General Comment
The use of AI has been a burden on Am erican livelyhoods rather than the helpful tool it was advertised as. It is not worth the cost of
production to use and update various form s of AI. The strain it puts on energy resources and as well as the econom y through dodgy
investing is good enough reason not to waste any m ore taxpayer dollars.
