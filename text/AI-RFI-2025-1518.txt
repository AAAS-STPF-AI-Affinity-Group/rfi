General Comment
Dear governm ent!
As an Am erican citizen and an artist I beg m y country to advocate for its hardworking citizens. Allowing big tech to train on copyrighted
m aterial will never put us ahead of any other country. But destroying copyright laws will allow anyone even com petitors use our data. It it
worth it? 
In m y experience generative AI didn’t bring us anything good. Lives of m y peers are being destroyed by it. We are losing jobs. Children in
schools no longer think critically, they’d rather believe unchecked m isinform ation produced by AI chatbots rather than their teachers or
parents. Scientific papers are being published backed by the ghost references hallucinated by AI engines. 
The Fifth Am endm ent to the Constitution clearly states that private property shall not be taken for public use without just com pensation.
My art is m y property. There never was and in given circum stances can never be any just com pensation when our property will be used
against us to train m achine that replaces us. By destroying copyright you are destroying constitutional rights of your citizens.
