General Comment
I believe that generative AI is a grave threat to art and hum an creativity. It enables som eone to steal work that som eone else worked on,
perhaps for a very long tim e, and take that work and repackage it to represent it as their own. It is a high-tech plagiarism  m achine in
essence. Creativity is not som ething that should be autom ated, and especially not autom ated in the way generative AI does it, which is
nothing m ore or less than theft. Please do not give OpenAI, or any other com pany using AI, the ability to steal people's work and then be
im m une to all lawsuits against them  for their thefts.
