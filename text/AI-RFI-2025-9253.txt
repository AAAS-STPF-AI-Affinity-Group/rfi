General Comment
AI is not a tool for the future but som ething created to steal the work of others. It is not useful to our every day life to create a m achine
that is based off of things already existing, pretending to create som ething new. We need to put m oney into funding m ore art program s and
m ore tech program s, not funding the end of those spaces. AI is not a useful tool. It steals the ideas of others and destroys the planet in the
process. No m ore govt funding for AI.
