General Comment
Many current practices of gathering the vast am ount of data for training AI are unethical, deceptive, and violations of intellectual property
and privacy rights. I am  a strong advocate for transparency on datasets used for training AI, as well as protections for personal privacy.
Also I am  growingly concerned about tech com panies pushing underdeveloped and undertested AI program s with a "m ove fast and break
things" m entality into sectors that require a lot m ore vigilance, such as healthcare, and com panies are increasingly pressured to utilize these
frankly dangerous technologies.
