General Comment
AI technology is based upon stealing from  existing sources: artwork, writing, and so m uch m ore. It has becom e a serious threat that has
poisoned all search results, m aking it harder to find inform ation that hasn't been tainted. 
AI by its nature violates copyright law and cannot be allowed to continue in its current state.
