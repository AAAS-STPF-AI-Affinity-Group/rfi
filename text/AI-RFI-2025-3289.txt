General Comment
AI is theft at unprecedented scale. It only serves to m ake the rich richer, and rem ove jobs from  actual professionals by stealing their work.
An industry that can only exist through the theft of data, without perm ission or com pensation, should not be allowed to operate. 
As it stands now, generative AI is useless as it gives out dangerously false inform ation. These predatory com panies should be punished for
the laws they have already broken.
