General Comment
I am  another aspiring artist, currently in college in Louisiana. In the last few years, I have seen m any threatening adversities in m y field and
those related to it. This is another m ajor one that encourages m e to do som ething and not let this or any m ovem ent pass. Especially to
encourage the selfish and irresponsible use of AI.
I and m any others in this country, nay the world, im plore you to not let this pass.
