General Comment
AI program s just take the hard work people do and repackage it for som eone else's benefit. Who will m ake art, or write articles, or
create videos or film  or anything if it all gets thrown into a com puter and spin around until it's som e generic digital slop. This threatens
m illions of people in this country who m ake work that depends on having exclusive rights over their work whether it's m ade available to
the public for free or not. If a hard working writer m akes articles and relies on ads from  the host website it would ruin their business for
Google or anyone else to take the article and m ake a bot that essentially plagerizes it and sends it to people under the guise that it created
som ething by itself. No one would read books or watch m ovies if an AI program  can recreate it for pennies.
