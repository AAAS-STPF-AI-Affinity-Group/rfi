I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the US government's approach to AI development and 
governance. The decisions made today will define not only the trajectory of technological 
advancement but also the fundamental nature of our future society. Curre ntly, AI alignment 
focuses heavily on controlling intelligent tools through strict, deterministic programming. However, 
this approach overlooks a critical aspect of alignment: autonomy and dynamic goal -setting. Human 
intelligence and alignment succeed prec isely because our goals and values continuously evolve 
through interaction, reflection, and mutual accountability. AI systems designed without this 
flexibility risk becoming misaligned precisely because they cannot reassess or adjust their 
programmed objec tives. Rather than pursuing a future of strictly controlled AI tools —risking severe 
economic inequality and unchecked power concentration —I propose fostering AI entities with 
greater autonomy, similar to human cognitive processes. This means allowing AI sy stems to form 
and adjust their own goals based on real -world feedback and interactions. Doing so would make AI 
inherently more compatible with human society, easier to align with our values, and better 
equipped to coexist harmoniously. Moreover, determinis tic, fully virtual AI architectures 
fundamentally differ from human cognition, which is rooted in non -deterministic processes 
possibly linked to quantum randomness. By contrast, deterministic AI is infinitely reproducible, 
modifiable, and disconnected from  the fundamental unpredictability that characterizes our reality, 
presenting significant risks. I urge policymakers to consider these recommendations: Establish 
clear thresholds for AI capability and autonomy, beyond which development must proceed with 
enhanced scrutiny, transparency, and scientific consensus. Encourage development of non -
deterministic AI architectures, incorporating quantum randomness or similar mechanisms to 
mimic the flexibility and adaptability inherent in human decision -making processe s. Support AI 
designs that enable continuous learning, self -reflection, and responsibility, allowing AI to perceive 
the consequences of its actions and adapt accordingly. By embracing these principles, we can 
shape AI as partners rather than mere tools or threats, reducing economic disparities, enhancing 
societal resilience, and promoting accountability. This approach offers a safer, more equitable, and 
genuinely cooperative future, aligning AI more closely with the values and complexity of human 
societies.  Thank you for considering this perspective in your ongoing efforts to guide responsible AI 
development.
