General Comment
I am  against any form  of AI developm ent. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
AI steals from  the livelihood of Am erican artists and profits off of the theft of their hard work. 
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. It's a technology whose costs far outweighs the benefits.
