General Comment
AI should not be tolerated. This is not "developm ent," this is blatant theft of not just works of art but also theft of jobs and job security.
This is the theft of other people's intellectual property, and it's disgraceful that this has been considered for so long. It's clear by the
introduction of this plan that these are things you do not care about - if you have any conscience, this will be destroyed before it hits the
floor.
