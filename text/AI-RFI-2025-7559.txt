General Comment
If LLMs/im age generators are allowed to train on DRM-controlled/copyrighted content, piracy will run ram pant. This m easure would
violate the rights of m any creators, both big and sm all, without com pensating them . It will not create value for Am erican workers - only the
biggest AI research com panies.
