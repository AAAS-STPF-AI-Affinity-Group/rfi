General Comment
This itself is why we need regulation on agencies. AI developm ent should not be based on the the actual artwork and physical work of
people without their consent.
The whole point of this is to literally hurt a working class. Im plem enting allowing a big conglom erate such as google to get access to data
in such a way and to develop it further is going to harm  working people.
THIS itself is not what AI should be trained on nor does AI generative program s help when it is actively used to reduce staffing as a cost
cutting m easure.
All of this with this current adm inistration is a sign that this is a conflict of interest as people in power will benefit from  such regulations
being passed.
