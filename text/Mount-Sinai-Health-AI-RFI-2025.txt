Re: AI Action Plan  
Dear Director Dohne,  
We are writing on behalf of the Mount Sinai Health System to 
commend the Administration’s AI Action Plan and offer 
recommendations rooted in our clinical and research leadership. Our 
suggestions underscore the urgent need for robust, r isk-based AI 
governance in healthcare, aligning closely with our institutional 
mission and the broader goals of your initiative.  
The Mount Sinai Health System, including the Icahn School of 
Medicine, represents a vibrant academic and clinical institution 
recognized for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare. 
Recently named among the world's best smart hospitals by 
Newsweek, Mount Sinai embraces AI to enhance diagnostic 
accuracy, accelerate therapeutic discoveries, and personalize patient 
care. Evidence supports AI’s transformative potential to improve 
healthcare delivery, clinical outcomes, and operational efficiency, 
affirming our institutional pursuit of AI innovation and implementation¹.  
We highlight the following key priorities for the Administration’s AI 
Action Plan, emphasizing healthcare applications:  
1. Standardized AI Performance Benchmarks
With the rapid proliferation of AI tools, it is imperative to adopt uniform
performance standards for evaluating accuracy, robustness, and
reliability. Such benchmarks will facilitate objective assessment and


comparison across AI systems, building trust and promoting scalable 
deployment.  
Rationale . Studies highlight standardized validation protocols as 
critical for ensuring AI system effectiveness  and patient safety in 
clinical practice².  
2. Continuous Real -World Monitoring
Effective governance requires ongoing oversight beyond initial
validation. We urge dedicated funding and mechanisms for
continuous monitoring to swiftly identify biases, errors , or unintended
consequences in AI systems deployed in clinical environments.
Rationale . Continuous post -market surveillance has been shown
essential to maintain AI system integrity, detect performance
deterioration, and minimize bias³.
3.Transparent Reporting & Risk -Based Frameworks
Clear reporting of limitations and failure rates, tailored to the risk level
of clinical or administrative applications, will ensure transparency,
accountability, and informed deployment of AI technologies.
Rationale . Transparent disclosures enhance clinical understanding of
AI limitations, ensuring appropriate reliance and usage, and
preventing potential patient harm from AI -driven errors⁴.
4. AI Assurance and Data Governance
We strongly support mandatory fairness audits, ethical data -sharing
guidelines, and strengthened patient privacy measures. Additionally,
explicit accountability for AI vendors regarding adherence to data
privacy standards and liability for breaches is esse ntial.
Rationale . Rigorous data governance, including stringent privacy
protection, ensures public trust and successful AI integration. Clear
delineation of vendor accountability reduces institutional risk
exposure⁵.
5. Investment in Workforce Training
Investment in specialized training programs for healthcare providers,
regulators, and IT personnel is necessary for effectively managing AI
implementation. AI should augment clinical decision -making, not
replace clinicians.


Rationale . Workforce preparedness significantly influences AI 
adoption success, helping clinicians integrate AI as a supportive tool, 
not a replacement⁶.  
6. Open -Source Availability of Federally Funded AI Models
The Administration should adopt policies ensuring federally funded AI
models are made available as open -source resources. This measure
would democratize AI access, allowing resource -constrained
healthcare institutions to accelerate adoption and benefit equally from
technological advancements.
Rationale . Open -source AI models have b een shown to reduce
barriers to  entry, accelerate innovation, and improve healthcare
outcomes, particularly among resource -limited institutions⁷.
7. Streamlined FDA Regulatory Processes
We urge the Administration to streamline FDA regulatory processes,
providing mechanisms for expedited review of iterative AI innovations
while maintaining necessary safety oversight. Simplifying these
processes would facilitate more rapid integration of valuable AI tools
into clinical care.
Rationale . Research has demonstrated that lengthy regulatory
approval timelines may slow AI -driven innovation in healthcare.
Expedited review processes can balance the need for rapid
innovation with patient safety⁸.
8. Prohibition of AI Misuse by Insurers in Claims  Review
We advocate regulations explicitly prohibiting insurers and benefit
plans from misusing AI technologies in claims adjudication processes.
Denials of medical care should not be automated; each denial
decision must involve careful medical review by q ualified physicians.
Rationale . Legislative investigations have identified significant risks
associated with AI -driven denials of necessary healthcare services,
emphasizing the ethical imperative of maintaining clinician -led
oversight of healthcare decisio ns⁹.
The insights from Mount Sinai Health System’s leadership confirm 
that these measures are not only timely but crucial for advancing safe 
and equitable AI innovation in healthcare. By integrating these 
recommendations into the AI Action Plan, we can bui ld a framework 


that not only accelerates technological progress but also ensures that 
such advancements are realized in a safe, effective and ethical way. 
We appreciate the Administration’s proactive approach in inviting 
public comment and remain optimisti c that, with collaborative efforts 
and targeted investments, we can foster a healthcare ecosystem 
where AI serves as a transformative force for patient care, public 
health, and overall societal well -being.  
Thank you for this opportunity to contribute.
