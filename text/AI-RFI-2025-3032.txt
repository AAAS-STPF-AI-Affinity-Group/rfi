General Comment
I am  severely against giving AI any legal power whatsoever at this present tim e. Of course creative livelihoods will be at stake with the
replacem ent of such an im m oral tool, but with that replacem ent there will be nothing left for the AI to steal from .
People should work with what AI is capable of now instead of being replaced by the tool itself. All AI can do is take from  what already
exists, and without the copyright boundary, hum an creation will be killed. In turn, AI will also quickly stagnate with no creatives to feed off
of, and will ruin the tool itself.
We are barely figuring out a way to co-exist with AI right now, so giving anym ore rights to AI right now is a terrible m ove and idea.
