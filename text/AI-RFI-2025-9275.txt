General Comment
Aside from  the fact that so m any of the parties that push 'AI' so hard are a bunch of grifters seeking to fleece as m any people for as m uch
m oney as possible for their own gain, the idea that "barriers" to the developm ent of 'AI' should be rem oved is ludicrous. It's as if you're
actively saying "Hey, we should be able to do whatever the heck we want regardless of the legality because that way we get to m ake
m ore m oney."
People over profits. I know that's a hard sentim ent for som e to get their heads around but these blatant efforts to stifle real creativity and
ham string actual creative peoples is disgusting.
