Re: Request for Information (RFI) on the Development of an Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Action 
Plan (“Plan”)  
We, the members of America's entertainment industry — representing an intersection of 
cinematographers, directors, producers, actors, writers, studios, production companies, musicians, composers, costume, sound & production designers, editors, gaffers, union and Academy Members, and other industrious, creative content professionals – submit this unified statement in response to the Administration's request for input on the AI Action Plan.  
We firmly believe that America’s global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our 
essential creative industries. America’s arts and entertainment industry supports over 2.3M American jobs with over $229Bn in wages annually, while providing the foundation for 
American democratic influence and soft power abroad. But AI companies are asking to undermine this economic and cultural strength by weakening copyright protections for the films, television series, artworks, writing, music, and voices used to train AI models at the core of multi-billion dollar corporate valuations.    
It is clear that Google (valued at $2Tn) and OpenAI (valued at over $157Bn) are arguing for a special government exemption so they can freely exploit America’s creative industries, despite their substantial revenues and available funds. There is no reason to weaken or eliminate the copyright protections which have helped America flourish. Not when AI companies can use our copyrighted material by simply doing what the law requires: negotiating appropriate licenses with copyright holders — just as every other  industry 
does. Access to America’s creative catalogue of films, writing, video content and music is not a matter of national security. They do not require a government-mandated exemption from existing U.S. copyright law. 


 2 America didn’t become a global cultural powerhouse by accident. Our success stems 
directly from our fundamental respect for intellectual property and copyright that rewards creative risk-taking by talented and hardworking Americans from every state and territory . 
For nearly 250 years, U.S. copyright law has balanced creator’s rights with the needs of the public, creating the world's most vibrant creative economy. We recommend that the American AI Action Plan uphold existing copyright frameworks to maintain the strength of America’s creative industries, as well as American cultural influence abroad.
