My name is Ben Hebor and I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High 
School. I have completed a semester course on AI and Ethics and studied the impact of Generative AI on Politics. Executive Order 14179 will have a mixed result on AI In American Politics. Through my research of AI effects on politics I have discovere d the ins and outs of how 
political campaigns use generative AI to get elected. The main use of AI in politics is to create advertising. Advertising using generative AI has been found to be extremely effective in our modern world, which can cause misleading information and ideas that can be spread like a wildfire. This is especially magnified in the older generations who are not as familiar with AI and what is real. I would like to see the Federal government move in a way to restrict the use of AI in a poli tical fashion. Numerous laws similar to what I suggest exist on the state level from 
Florida to California. This could prove to be a beneficial step in the realm of AI to “solidify our position as the global leader in AI and secure a brighter future for al l Americans”(E.O. 14179) 
while keeping American elections fair and free.
