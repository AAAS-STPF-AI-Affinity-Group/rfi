General Comment
Copyright is an im portant part of protecting m y livelihood as a creator. AI should not be exem pt from  copyright rules. I have deep
concerns about the speed with which AI LLMs are being adopted and want to ensure that hum an creators have extensive copyright
protections. Rem oving guardrails for AI will decim ate creatives and their abilities to m ake a living.
