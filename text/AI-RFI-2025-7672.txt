General Comment
AI is a scam  technology that does not do what it purports to do and can only function by stealing from  the livelihoods of Am ericans like
m e. It is theft, pure and sim ple. AI needs guardrails of all kinds, up to and including protecting the environm ent from  the destruction of
resources that it represents, and keeping it away from  copyrighted m aterial that it actively uses to steal from  Am erican citizens.
