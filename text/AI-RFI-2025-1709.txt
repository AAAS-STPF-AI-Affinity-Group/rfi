General Comment
Without proper oversight and strident accountability protocols, there is no path forward where AI is not abused by a handful in power.
Wielded by these few influential persons adjacent to our governm ent, AI system s pose a real and im m inent threat to national security.
Any allusions to “AI dom inance” are sim ply hype from  interests in Silicone Valley trying to capitalize on a new sort of arm s race. 
I do not believe AI com panies hold the interests of the Am erican people above them selves and their shareholders, and only seek to
pervert science for political and extrem e m onetary gain at others’ expense.
