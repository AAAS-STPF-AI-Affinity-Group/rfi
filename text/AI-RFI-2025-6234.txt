General Comment
Artificial intelligence, a m isnom er for a basic prediction m achine that routinely uses faulty data, will hinder Am erican ingenuity, creativity,
and innovation in the long term . It is also a waste of resources such as water and even space (the dedication of land to server farm s for
exam ple) for a fad technology. It's already been shown that one of the supposed pioneers of AI, Microsoft, is backing out on agreem ents
to build a m ore robust infrastructure around this because of how costly and wasteful it will be.
People who cannot do basic tasks such as com posing an em ail, nom inal research, dem onstrate an am ount of literacy to understand a text
rather than get a sixty percent wrong sum m ary and overrely on it, that lack the basic skills of com position to create art, or to even build
their own code and instead m ust rely on AI are a hindrance to our workforce, not innovators.
AI also overrelies on stolen labor without com pensation.
