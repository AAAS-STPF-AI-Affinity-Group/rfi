General Comment
My nam e is Grace Schm igel, and I am  a high school student, about to graduate from  Avonworth High School. I researched the im pact of
Generative AI in the world of Paleontology and related Earth sciences for two m onths, in a course called AI and Ethics. Based on m y
research, I think that the new viewpoint on AI regulation from  this current adm inistration will benefit hum an flourishing, as long as the
viewpoint rem ains worker-focused. From  m y research, I learned that the biggest threat AI poses to Paleontology, and the scientific
com m unity in general, is stealing jobs. Iâ€™ve seen how AI can replace entire production team s to create a docum entary, and I have also
seen how AI has physically replaced m useum  docents in leading paleontological institutions. Another problem  that could occur through the
use of generative AI in paleontology is creating or spreading m isinform ation. When used as a research tool, based on its m athem atical
algorithm s, AI could generate false inform ation or spread outdated inform ation. This is could be a real concern for alm ost any research-
based field, since AI has been proven to have flawed logic skills. If innovation is valued higher than regulation, I believe that the logic skills
of AI could im prove. As long as the viewpoint of the governm ent rem ains protective of workers and jobs, I believe that this is a positive
change.
