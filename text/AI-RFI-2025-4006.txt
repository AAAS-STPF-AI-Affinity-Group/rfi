General Comment
You want m y com m ent? You want to hear m y com m ent?
This is awful. This is terrible. This is disgusting. This is dam aging to every person in the country, and subsequently, since this country sets
so m any trends, every person in the world. The ones pushing this are spineless, worthless, cowardly, greedy wastes.
AI is trash. AI only exists through stealing. AI threatens the jobs and livelihoods of m any, m any people. AI products m ake everything
worse.
Stop.
It.
