General Comment
It is reprehensible that a com pany whose business m odel relies solely upon the back of untold am ounts of unrecognized, unpaid creative
work would be given a pass for unrestricted regulation to do what it pleases, solely for the reason of profit is nothing short of evil and
should NOT be heavily scrutinized for its dam age to its disinform ation and m isinform ation practices that perm eate online spaces. Allowing
OpenAI to run freely places an ENORMOUS num ber of skilled workers at risk in num erous sectors of private and public business,
workers that rely m ore on such work than investm ents for a nam eless, faceless algorithm  that cannot produce anything beyond what is fed
into it. Its ecological harm , additionally, and variable energy requirem ents, are extraordinary in its scope to m aintain and do nothing m ore
than to produce low quality data with a net harm . Allowing AI to function with NO regulations to its private sector should absolutely NOT
happen.
