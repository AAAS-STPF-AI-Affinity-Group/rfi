General Comment
I do not believe Al holds a place in the future of the US.
Al steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
Al is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
This is just another grift from  big tech billionaires trying to syphon m oney from  us hard working Am ericans to line their pockets and off
shore bank accounts.
