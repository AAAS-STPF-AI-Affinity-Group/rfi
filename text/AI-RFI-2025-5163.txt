General Comment
As a creative professional, I am  entirely self-m ade. I cam e from  poverty and lifted m yself up by m y proverbial bootstraps. 
AI is a direct threat and insult to that perseverance; the Am erican spirit of self-determ ined success. It works by scraping what people like
m yself have spent our lives m aking, steals that work, and then spits out a “product” that has no utility, that seeks to “solve” a non-existent
problem . Not only does it threaten the livelihood of people like m yself, (a hard-working, self-m ade sm all business owner), but it seeks to
do so using our own work. That theft m ust not and cannot be allowed to take place without threat of legal action from  us m akers who
create things from  our blood, sweat, tears, and labor. Period. This is all not even to m ention the environm ental toll the software takes with
each use. 
To allow this farcical technology to keep existing off of the backs of our labor is un-Am erican in every way, and it is your duty to disallow
its use of existing copyrighted works. 
Thank you.
