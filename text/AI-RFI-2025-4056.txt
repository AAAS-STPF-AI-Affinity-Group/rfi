General Comment
I am  an artist and som eone in the tech field. I am  fam iliar with how 'AI" works, and all it does is take the data given to it, jum ble it up a bit,
then spit out whatever is requested of it. It cannot think, nor is generative AI intended to. It's just intended to be a crash grab. And I refuse
to allow m y artworks to be part of this cash grab. It voids copyright, and it voids our rights to our own data. These AI don't just crawl art
sites, they crawl everywhere. They steal data from  everywhere that isn't secure enough. It's not just art. It's pictures, posts, writings. It's
things m ost people never expected they had to worry about. So do not allow generative AI com panies to keep stealing from  people.
Protect our data.
