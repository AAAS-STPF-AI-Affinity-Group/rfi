Dear Faisal D'Souza and the OSTP/NITRD NCO Team,
I am writing in response to the Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. I strongly recommend that, as one of the first priority projectsunder this initiative, the government launch a comprehensive security white hat hackingManhattan Project. This initiative would leverage frontier AI models—those cutting-edgesystems that, while pushing the boundaries of innovation, also pose significant hacking risks.
Proposal Overview
Given the accelerating pace at which adversaries are advancing their AI capabilities, it isimperative that we adopt a proactive approach. The proposed project would bring togetherelite cybersecurity experts, white hat hackers, and AI researchers in a large-scale, government-led effort to:
Identify Vulnerabilities Early: Use state-of-the-art frontier models to systematically scan our
critical systems, uncovering potential exploits before adversaries have the opportunity toexploit them.
Develop Robust Defense Mechanisms: Establish a dedicated framework for continuous
penetration testing, red teaming, and adversarial simulations that evolves in step with rapidtechnological advancements.
Foster Public-Private Collaboration: Engage industry leaders, academic researchers, and
government agencies to create a unified and dynamic defense strategy that not only securesour digital infrastructure but also reinforces America’s leadership in AI innovation.
Set National Security Precedents: By prioritizing this initiative, the United States can solidify
its commitment to national security and technological superiority, ensuring that vulnerabilitiesare addressed proactively rather than reactively.
Rationale
Frontier AI models represent both a remarkable opportunity for innovation and a potentialsecurity risk if not managed properly. In an era where cyber threats can emerge from anysector, this white hat hacking project would serve as a critical safeguard—ensuring that oursystems are fortified against the very vulnerabilities that adversaries might seek to exploitusing similar or more advanced technologies. In short, this proactive measure is essential formaintaining a secure and resilient technological infrastructure while preserving ourcompetitive edge in AI.
I urge the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the NITRD National Coordination
Office to consider this proposal as a cornerstone of the AI Action Plan. Prioritizing security


through such an initiative will help ensure that we find and address all exploits in our systems
well before adversaries have the opportunity to do so.
Thank you for considering this submission.Sincerely,Matthew Kruse
