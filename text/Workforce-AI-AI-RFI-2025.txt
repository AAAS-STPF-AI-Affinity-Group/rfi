March 15, 2025 Page 1 of 13 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the National Science Foundation’s Request for 
Information (RFI) on the National AI Action Plan. Our response advocates for Workforce AI Ô as 
the only non-complicated solution for AI‐driven workforce augmentation in the federal 
government. Workforce AI is a human‐centric artificial intelligence platform purpose-built to 
empower employees - augmenting, automating, and ultimately replacing repetitive administrative 
tasks. By emphasizing an intuitive human‐user interface, 
ease of use, and seamless integration into daily 
workflows, Workforce AI can drive rapid adoption, boost 
efficiency, and enhance institutional knowledge across 
the federal workforce. 
In an era when U.S. global leadership in artificial 
intelligence is pivotal to economic competitiveness and 
national security, Workforce AI offers a groundbreaking 
solution to transform federal operations. Our digital 
employee platform is engineered to augment human 
capabilities by automating repetitive tasks while preserving the essential human touch, thus 
ensuring that government efficiency is not only improved but also aligned with the broader 
strategic goals of maintaining American innovation and leadership in AI. By delivering rapid, 
measurable productivity gains at a fraction of traditional costs, Workforce AI stands as a key 
enabler for a modern, agile federal workforce that drives the nation’s competitive edge.  
Unlike traditional chatbots (which are primarily text-based, requiring specialized “prompt 
engineering”) or complicated enterprise AI platforms, Workforce AI ensures a frictionless 
experience. We deliver a simple AI with personality - an accessible video avatar which looks like 
a human that employees readily trust, rather than a purely text-based black box. This difference is 
crucial: many AI deployments fail after pilot phase because employees find them too cumbersome 
or non-intuitive. Workforce AI breaks through this barrier, allowing agencies to finally collaborate with an easy-to-use AI that fosters genuine day-to-day adoption. 
We focus on “simple AI” with personality, ensuring a real sense of collaboration. Our approach 
fosters easy user interactions that let employees feel they are working side-by-side with a digital 
colleague, rather than commanding a black-box system. 
In light of Executive Orders 14158 & 14210, and other related DOGE initiatives that mandate 
aggressive modernization and efficiency improvements (including hiring ratios that limit new hires 
to one per four separations), the federal government must modernize quickly. Workforce AI’s 
digital employees are designed to deliver rapid, measurable wins that support each agency’s 
mission while fulfilling policy mandates. Our solution reduces the cost burden by delivering 
humanlike AI-powered digital employees at approximately 20% of the cost compared to typical a 
federal administrative employee. We can provide significant budgetary relief while also boosting 
workforce productivity and enhancing institutional knowledge through task augmentation . 
We offer bold, evidence-backed insights below on how Workforce AI can help achieve the AI 
Action Plan’s goals, along with policy recommendations that leverage these strengths. We 
conclude with a call to action to ensure the federal government fully realizes the benefits of our 
approach. Workforce AI is a human‐
centric artificial intelligence 
platform purpose-built to 
empower employees - 
augmenting, automating, and 
ultimately replacing repetitive 
administrative tasks.

March 15, 2025 Page 2 of 13 The sections below demonstrate how Workforce AI’s unique approach, alignment with federal 
mandates, and robust security posture can be a game-changer for federal operations. 
2.0 CAPABILITY STATEMENT  
2.1 What We Do 
Our solution augments, then automates, and finally 
replaces repetitive administrative tasks by deploying 
human‑like digital employees into online meetings, 
websites, applications and daily workflows. 
Through our Human User Interface (HUI) Ô, digital 
employees engage in natural, conversational interactions 
with federal staff, thereby increasing their knowledge, 
and enabling smarter decision-making. The digital 
employees can also perform tasks for federal workers. AI performing tasks is known as agentic 
activity.  
2.2 How We’re Different 
üHuman‑Centric Design: Unlike traditional AI or rigid automation platforms, our realistic
video avatars foster trust and ease-of-use among non-technical users. Think of each digital
employee as a ‘digital twin’ for each worker – capable of mirroring tasks, capturing
knowledge, and offloading routine processes so the real employee can focus on criticalproblem-solving.
üSeamless Integration & Scalability: Our system can integrate effortlessly with existinggovernment systems (e.g., ERP, CRM, MS Office, Teams) and supports rapid deployment and
scaling which is essential under the current federal modernization mandates. These integrations
will minimize disruption to existing workflows.
üCost Efficiency: By replacing tasks that cost an average of $50K per employee annually with
digital employees at approximately 20% of the cost, 
agencies can achieve significant cost reductions while maintaining productivity. For example, replacing 
10,000 administrative roles at $50K each saves 
$500M annually, while deploying 100 digital 
employees would cost approximately $100M, 
yielding $400M in net savings per year, or a 75% cost 
reduction, enhancing budget flexibility for mission-
critical initiatives. 
üFaster Than Hiring: While it can take agencies months to recruit, vet, and onboard newemployees, deploying a digital employee often takes just days. This drastically cuts the time-
to-productivity gap. Rather than waiting 3–6 months for new staff, agencies can spin up
Workforce AI's digital workers nearly immediately - enhancing capacity and output long
before a human hire could be found.
üSecurity & Compliance: Our proactive approach will include regular third-party audits to
align with FedRAMP, NIST 800-53 and AI RMF frameworks. We ensure that all data is
encrypted in transit and at rest, meeting federal security standards essential for immediate pilot
deployment.Through our Human User 
Interface (HUI) Ô, digital 
employees engage in natural, 
conversational interactions with 
federal staff, thereby increasing
their knowledge, and enabling
smarter decision-making.
By replacing tasks that cost an

March 15, 2025 Page 3 of 13 üDesign Philosophy and Ethical Considerations: Our design philosophy is rooted in the
principle that AI must be accessible and understandable to truly empower federal employees.
By also emphasizing a transparent, human-in-the-loop model, Workforce AI inherently
reduces the risk of opaque decision-making, minimizes biases through continuous user
oversight, and ensures that any issues of data privacy are managed through straightforward,
explainable mechanisms. In this way, our approach supports the broader policy objectives of
protecting civil liberties and maintaining public trust in AI deployments, while also driving
efficiency and innovation.
üAccessible to All: We specifically designed Workforce AI’s interface to be accessible for awide range of employees and citizens interacting with the government, including older
workers or those who are not tech savvy. Because our solution relies on natural spoken
conversations and a visual avatar, employees with dyslexia or limited digital literacy can
interact easily without needing advanced IT skills. This ensures that “everyone,” not just
tech-savvy staff, can benefit from AI’s efficiency.
3.0 P
OLICY ROADMAP & ALIGNMENT WITH FEDERAL INITIATIVES  
Our response is designed to directly support key federal mandates and efficiency directives:  
§EO 14158 & EO 14210: These orders require agencies to reduce workforce size (1 hire per 4
departures) while maintaining service quality or increasing output. Our digital employees
enable agencies to continue delivering essential services at a fraction of the cost, helping tooffset mandated reductions by augmenting remaining staff.
§DOGE & Government Efficiency Initiatives: By providing measurable, rapid efficiencyimprovements, Workforce AI fits squarely into agency plans for digital modernization. Our
solution can be incorporated into an agency’s hiring plan presented to the President, ensuring
that even in large-scale  Reductions in Force (RIF), operational capacity and service quality
remain high.
3.1 Workforce AI’s Competitive Advantages in AI-Driven Workforce Augmentation 
Workforce AI distinguishes itself from other AI platforms through a user-first design philosophy 
and practical features tailored to federal workforce needs. Our solution’s competitive advantages directly address common barriers to AI adoption in large organizations:  
§Intuitive Human-User Interface: Workforce AI features a conversational, user-friendly
interface that requires no specialized training or coding expertise. Employees interact with theAI as naturally as they would with a colleague, asking questions or requesting support in plain
language. This design lowers the barrier to entry dramatically. Research shows that perceived
usefulness and ease of use are the top factors influencing people’s willingness to adopt AI .  By
prioritizing clarity and simplicity, Workforce AI fosters immediate trust and comfort, unlike
competing solutions that overwhelm users with technical complexity.
§Ease of Use and Minimal Training: Because of its intuitive design, Workforce AI can berolled out with minimal training overhead. New users can be up and running in minutes, which
accelerates organization-wide adoption. In contrast, many AI tools demand extensive
onboarding or learning “prompt engineering” to get value, discouraging busy federal
employees from using them. Workforce AI’s plug-and-play simplicity ensures that even non-
technical staff - from procurement officers to field agents - can harness AI assistance
confidently. This ease of use translates to higher adoption rates and quicker ROI. Indeed,


AI Acti
RFI Response
\ 
March 15, 2025 Page 4 of 13 technology adoption studies have long affirmed that if a system is not user-friendly, employees 
simply won’t use it, derailing the initiative. Workforce AI squarely avoids that pitfall. 
§Augmentation Then Automation: Our approach focuses on augmenting human workers,
not replacing them. Workforce AI acts as a smart assistant that enhances employees’
capabilities – whether by rapidly retrieving knowledge, performing tedious tasks, or offering
decision support – while keeping the human in control. This philosophy contrasts with black-box automation solutions that attempt to entirely offload tasks and often face workforce
resistance. By keeping federal employees actively engaged and in the loop, Workforce AI
boosts job buy-in; staff see it as a tool that makes their jobs easier and more meaningful, rather
than a threat. This drives enthusiastic adoption. A recent survey found 71% of employees report
increased job satisfaction when AI is integrated into their daily tasks, precisely because AI ishelping with the grunt work and allowing them to focus on more rewarding responsibilities.
Workforce AI’s augmentation model taps into that dynamic, leading to higher morale and
acceptance across the board.
§Seamless Integration with Workflows: Workforce AI is designed to fit into existing federalIT environments, not disrupt them. Employees don’t have to learn a new system or constantly
switch contexts; the AI comes to their workflow. This stands in stark contrast to someenterprise AI solutions that force agencies to adopt entirely new software ecosystems or
complex data pipelines. By meeting users where they already work, Workforce AI removes
friction and shortens the learning curve. The result: faster deployment and immediate
productivity gains, without the typical change-management headaches.
§Knowledge Enhancement and Continuous Learning:  Beyond efficiency, Workforce AI
serves as a knowledge multiplier. It can instantly access and surface institutional knowledge,
policies, or best practices in response to an employee’s query – effectively putting a real-timeresearch assistant or trainer at every worker’s fingertips. This not only helps get work done
faster, but also upskills the workforce over time as employees learn from the AI’s answers
and recommendations. Competing AI solutions that are too convoluted or opaque fail to deliverthis kind of shared learning. Workforce AI’s straightforward explanations and sources build
user knowledge and confidence. Notably, 79% of employees believe that acquiring AI skills
(and by extension, learning from AI tools) will help advance their careers, and nearly half ofthose saving time with AI reinvest that time in further training. Workforce AI capitalizes on
this trend by actively encouraging knowledge transfer and growth on the job.
§24/7 Video Call Center Capability: Workforce AI can embed a video-based digital employee
on a public-facing website (e.g., IRS, VA, or Social Security) to handle routine citizen inquiriesaround the clock. Instead of waiting on hold for 30 minutes, citizens get immediate help
through a user-friendly avatar that can speak naturally, display relevant forms, and even
escalate if needed. This drastically cuts call volume, shortens wait times, and frees human
agents for complex or sensitive cases. The net impact is a potential savings of millions of
dollars annually in staffing costs, plus higher citizen satisfaction and zero backlog forstraightforward requests.
In sum, Workforce AI’s human- centric, “AI made easy” approach is purpose-built to drive 
widespread adoption and impact. Unlike overly complex platforms that remain underutilized or 
even unused, our solution is ready for the federal workforce at scale.

 4.0 TECHNICAL & OPERATIONAL APPROACH  
User Interface & Integration: Our HUI is the cornerstone of our solution. It translates complex 
AI functions into simple, conversational interactions that are easily understood by non-technical federal employees. 
Workforce AI leverages the latest foundational models 
and incorporates built-in fact-checking and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for comprehensive 
document analysis. Our platform can record video 
interactions for audit and quality control purposes, 
ensuring that every AI decision is transparent and 
reviewable. This robust technical foundation underpins our commitment to meeting all federal IT 
security standards. 
Operational Impact: Increased interaction with our AI leads to faster knowledge acquisition 
among staff, which in turn supports further task automation and higher efficiency. Our early pilot 
data (and analogous industry benchmarks) indicate that organizations can save 20–30% of administrative time.  
4.1 Implementation Roadmap 
§ Phase 1: Initiate a 90‑day pilot with formal documentation (proposal, SOW, NDA) tailored to meet current agency needs. 
§ Phase 2: Use pilot outcomes to refine integration, then scale deployment across agency units. 
§ Phase 3: Expand the deployment to capture broader usage and long‑term transformation. 
4.2 Sample Use Cases 
Beyond standard administrative tasks, some examples of what Workforce AI can replace: 
§ Leadership & Employee Coaching: Digital employees provide quick coaching tips or 
leadership best practices, gleaned from each agency’s leadership framework.  
§ IT Help Desk & HR Help Desk: Whether resetting passwords or explaining benefits policies, the AI can autonomously resolve tickets or escalate to a human if needed.  
§ Research Assistant: Summarize or cross-reference large volumes of documents, supporting policy writers or staff with instant information retrieval.  
§ Training & Onboarding: Serve as a trainer for new hires or for advanced upskilling, walking employees through modules or simulations, 24/7, on demand and customized.  
§ Social Worker/Support Agent: For agencies like HHS or local social services, the digital employee can deliver guidance on eligibility, steps for applications, or handle common 
questions at scale.  
§ VA Counselors & Benefits Advisors: Provide immediate triage for veterans seeking info on benefits or healthcare, handle routine queries before a human counselor is engaged for more personal cases.  
§ Legal Assistant or Proposal Writer: Understand internal templates, auto-draft proposals or briefs, and gather key references from the org’s database.  
All of these scenarios highlight how Workforce AI can become a companion that helps employees offload busywork while ensuring consistent, accurate support. 
 It translates complex AI 
functions into simple, 
conversational interactions that 
are easily understood by non-
technical federal employees.

March 15, 2025 Page 6 of 13 4.3 Evidence of Impact: Simplicity Overcomes the AI Non-Adoption Gap 
The promise of AI to reduce costs and supercharge productivity has been documented for years. 
Yet most AI solutions stall after initial pilots because employees simply do not use them in 
everyday workflows. In fact, an industry analysis revealed that the typical organization has 37 AI 
proof-of-concept projects, but only 5 make it to full production usage - primarily due to complexity. Similarly, surveys show that up to 86% of employees either reject or never fully 
embrace new AI tools also due to complexity. 
Typical AI: Theoretical Gains, Rarely Realized  
Despite studies indicating AI can reduce routine work by 30–40%, those advantages remain 
largely theoretical if staff find the tools too complicated to adopt. Many solutions require 
“prompt engineering,” specialized training, or navigating unfamiliar syste ms. Non-technical 
employees, especially, often revert to old manual workflows once initial excitement fades. Consequently, the vast majority of organizations never see AI’s advertised efficiency gains.  
Workforce AI’s Difference: Real Adoption Through Simplicity 
§Human-Like Avatar: By embedding a personable video agent into online meetings,websites, and daily tasks, employees interact with Workforce AI just by talking to it or typing
a quick request. There’s no extra software to open or complex prompts to memorize.
§Zero Technical Overhead: Because staff can engage the AI as if it were a real colleague, anyfriction that kills typical AI deployments is eliminated.
§Bridging Pilot to Production: The same user-centric interface that impresses people in a trialremains intuitive long-term. Once employees see how easily they can offload repetitive tasks
(scheduling, note-taking, form-filling) to a digital colleague, usage grows organically across
federal agencies.
Overcoming the ‘5 out of 37’ Pitfall 
Industry data shows most AI pilots fail to achieve permanent adoption. Workforce AI was built 
specifically to avert that fate: we prioritize user acceptance - no data science skills or prompt 
wizardry required. Our video-forward approach fosters trust, and straightforward onboarding 
spurs enthusiastic uptake. The result is a solution that’s used daily, not shelved post -pilot. 
Simplicity Conclusion 
Rather than listing hypothetical gains, Workforce AI delivers on -the-ground benefits by tackling 
the root cause of AI’s adoption gap: complexity. A complex AI solution with myriad features is worthless if nobody uses it; a simple, well-targeted AI assistant can transform every key metric - 
hours saved, errors reduced, morale boosted, and service delivery accelerated. We believe the 
National AI Action Plan should explicitly incorporate these lessons, steering federal AI 
deployments toward human-friendly design that guarantees genuine usage and ROI. Workforce 
AI proves that advanced AI can be both powerful and accessible, enabling agencies to move 
beyond theory and realize actual workforce transformation. 
4.4 Security & Compliance 
Ensuring robust security, privacy, and regulatory compliance is at the core of Workforce AI’s 
design. As federal agencies increasingly deploy AI-driven automation, compliance with 
government security standards, data privacy mandates, and risk management frameworks is

compliance. 
5.0 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ALIGNED WITH WORKFORCE AI’S STRENGTH  
Having demonstrated how a user-centric approach drastically boosts adoption, we now detail 
specific policy levers that can help the entire federal ecosystem achieve these benefits. 
To fully harness AI for workforce augmentation, policy guidance and federal initiatives should 
align with the factors that make solutions like Workforce AI successful. We respectfully propose 
the following policy recommendations, which both support the AI Action Plan’s objectives and 
create an environment where Workforce AI’s human-centric easy-to-use approach will 
thrive: 
1.Prioritize User-Centric Design and Usability in Federal AI Procurement: We recommend
that the AI Action Plan include guidelines for agencies to evaluate AI solutions based on ease
of use, intuitiveness, and training overhead as key criteria – on par with technical
performance. Too often, procurement focuses narrowly on AI capabilities or accuracy, whileneglecting the human factor that determines real-world adoption. By requiring evidence of
high user acceptance (e.g. through pilot results or usability testing) before full deployment,policymakers can ensure the chosen AI tools will actually be embraced by federal employees.
This user-centric procurement approach naturally favors solutions like Workforce AI, which
are built around human-friendly interfaces and quick onboarding. It will discourage overly
complex platforms that might look powerful on paper but fail to gain traction in practice. Inaddition, we suggest developing AI usability standards or certification (echoing the 57% of
professionals who support certification for AI systems) to guide vendors in designing forsimplicity and trust. Federal adoption of AI will accelerate if every solution is required to pass
a “user-friendliness” test.
2.Streamlined Procurement Pathways: Advocate for innovative contracting methods (e.g.,Other Transaction Authority or test-bed contracts) that allow rapid pilot deployment. This
approach aligns with recent deregulation efforts and EO 14179, which emphasize removing
barriers to technology adoption.
3.Integration of AI in Workforce Training: Include provisions for AI-driven upskillingprograms, where federal employees can improve their job performance by interacting with a
human-like AI knowledge hub that they can speak with conversationally, thereby boosting
productivity and reducing training costs.
4.Emphasize Augmentation and Human-AI
Collaboration in Policy Frameworks: The AIAction Plan should clearly articulate that the federal
government’s strategy is to augment human
workers with AI, not replace them. This stance willset the tone for responsible AI integration that has
broad workforce support. Concretely, policies could
mandate that AI systems include human-in-the-loop
capabilities, allowing employees to oversee, correct,
and learn from AI outputs. Agencies might be directed to start with use cases that relieve By framing AI as a collaborative 
partner, the government will 
alleviate employee fears and 
encourage active engagement 
with AI tools.

RFI Response
\ 
March 15, 2025 Page 9 of 13 employees of drudgery (data entry, routine research, simple customer queries) while 
enhancing their ability to perform mission-critical tasks, exactly as Workforce AI does. By 
framing AI as a collaborative partner, the government will alleviate employee fears and 
encourage active engagement with AI tools. This approach aligns with the documented finding 
that workers see AI as a “force for good” when it helps them be more effective. We also 
recommend that any ethical AI or job impact guidelines issued as part of the Plan highlight 
success stories of augmentation (where AI improved jobs and outcomes) to reinforce this 
narrative. 
5.Invest in AI Training, Change Management, and Knowledge Sharing: To complementintuitive AI solutions like Workforce AI, agencies should invest in training programs and
change management initiatives that prepare the workforce to make the most of AI. The Planshould allocate funding or resources for government-wide AI literacy programs, focusing on
practical skills (e.g. how to interact with AI assistants, how to interpret AI suggestions) rather
than technical development. Even though Workforce AI requires minimal training due to its
simplicity, empowering employees with a baseline understanding of AI increases comfort and
usage. Additionally, we propose establishing a Federal AI Workforce Augmentation
Council or working group that facilitates knowledge sharing across agencies – so lessonslearned and best practices (from pilot projects, for instance) can be disseminated. This could
involve periodic cross-agency workshops or an online repository of use cases. By sharing
success stories (for example, how one department saved thousands of hours with an AI
assistant, or how another improved employee satisfaction scores through AI support), the
government can build momentum and confidence in AI adoption. Such a council could also
develop common performance metrics (e.g. hours saved, user satisfaction, cost savings) for
AI workforce tools, which would guide agencies in evaluating solutions. Workforce AI’sdeployments would readily showcase strong performance on these metrics, helping set
benchmarks for the industry.
6.Encourage Pilot Programs Focused on Quick Wins and Scalability: We urge the NSF andpolicymakers to incorporate a “start small, think big” approach in the AI Action Plan.
Specifically, encourage each federal agency to run pilot projects with AI solutions in targeted
areas that can demonstrate quick wins (within 6-12 months) in efficiency and service delivery.
Ideal pilot candidates are processes that are labor-intensive and repetitive yet rule-based – areas
where Workforce AI excels. By structuring pilots to measure specific outcomes (time saved,
reduction in backlog, employee feedback, etc.), agencies can build a proof-of-concept for
broader AI rollout while managing risk. The policy could call for, say, at least one AI
workforce augmentation pilot in each agency within the next year, with results reported back
to a central body. Furthermore, we recommend requiring that these pilots consider usability
and adoption rates as success criteria, not just raw output metrics. This ensures that solutions
like Workforce AI, which score high with users, are recognized for their full value. Once a
pilot succeeds, the Plan should streamline the path to scale it agency-wide (perhaps through
fast-track procurement authorities or shared services frameworks). The end goal is a federated
network of AI-augmented teams across government, all achieving more with less effort.
7.Align AI Procurement Policies to Favor Flexible, Human-Centered Solutions: Federal
procurement regulations and grant programs can be tuned to favor our approach in subtle butpowerful ways. For instance, solicitations for AI systems could require a phase where end-
users test the product and provide feedback as part of the evaluation. This would naturallyelevate vendors that prioritize user experience (like Workforce AI) over those that focus only


AI Acti
RFI Response
\ 
March 15, 2025 Page 10 of 13 on technical specs. Scoring criteria can include user satisfaction scores from a trial period, or 
the percentage of target users who voluntarily adopt the tool – metrics where a human-centric 
solution shines. Additionally, policies might encourage modular, interoperable AI services 
(as opposed to monolithic systems). Workforce AI is modular and API or MCP driven, able to 
plug into various legacy systems and data sources securely. By valuing interoperability, the 
government avoids vendor lock-in and encourages the kind of flexible solution we provide. 
Finally, we advise incorporating language in the AI Action Plan around continuous 
improvement requirements – i.e., vendors must demonstrate the ability to update the AI with 
user feedback and new knowledge over time. This aligns with Workforce AI’s philosophy of 
evolving with the organization’s needs, and it weeds out static solutions that might quickly 
become obsolete or disliked by users. In short, thoughtful tweaks to procurement policy can 
create a market environment where the best human-friendly, effective AI tools rise to the top, 
to the benefit of the federal workforce. 
8.Support Innovative Small Businesses Startups in Federal AI Procurement: We encourage
policymakers to prioritize small, agile AI companies that often develop the most innovative
solutions. Too often, large vendors overshadow emerging startups in the federal procurement
process, stifling new ideas and competition. Providing set-asides or simplified acquisition
pathways specifically for small U.S.-based AI businesses will foster diversity, spur more
radical innovation, and ensure the benefits of advanced, user-friendly AI are widely availablerather than concentrated in a few large incumbents.
These policy recommendations all point toward a common theme: make “human-in-the-loop” 
and “ease of adoption” core pillars of the federal AI strategy. By doing so, the NSF and federal leaders will set the stage for AI deployments that actually work in practice and deliver ROI. This 
approach naturally favors solutions like Workforce AI without needing to call them out by name - 
it simply creates conditions where any AI platform must prove it can be adopted and make a 
difference for real employees. We are confident that Workforce AI will exceed those standards, and we stand ready to help the government implement these policies through collaboration and demonstration.

OMPETITIVE POSITIONING  
Workforce AI stands apart from competitors by offering the only digital employee solution that 
is easy to use, with a superior human user interface 
that drives genuine engagement and adoption. While 
other AI solutions are overly technical and complex, 
our system has been specifically designed for federal 
employees who need simplicity, efficiency, and real 
measurable savings. 
Workforce AI uniquely addresses the government’s 
need for efficient, user-friendly AI tools by focusing 
on augmentation rather than complete automation. 
Unlike traditional robotic process automation (RPA) 
or complex enterprise AI systems that require 
extensive training and technical expertise, our solution is built around a conversational, 
intuitive interface that federal employees can use with minimal onboarding. This not only reduces resistance to adoption but also enhances productivity by allowing staff to quickly gain 
valuable insights and offload repetitive tasks. Our system’s seamless integration with existing Workforce AI stands apart from 
competitors by offering the only 
digital employee solution that is

complete overhaul of current infrastructure. 
Workforce AI differs markedly from traditional solutions: 
•Against RPA Tools: While RPA focuses on rule-based automation, requires technical setup and
simply mimic keystrokes for rule-based tasks, Workforce AI leverages advanced natural languageprocessing and a dynamic, human-like interface that manages both structured and unstructured
tasks. It enables non-technical users to interact naturally, reducing adoption barriers and enhancing
productivity, making it superior for federal workforce augmentation.
•Compared to Basic Chatbots: Traditional chatbots are limited to text-based interactions and
require prompt engineering but cannot execute complex workflows. In contrast, Workforce AI’s
digital employees perform actions - from filling forms to integrating with legacy systems - while
maintaining a friendly, conversational and intuitive interface.
•Over Legacy AI Solutions: Older AI systems often require extensive customization and fail to
integrate with existing workflows. Our platform is designed for rapid deployment and seamless
integration, ensuring immediate ROI.
6.1 Call to Action: Partner with Workforce AI for Pilot Programs and Future 
Procurement 
To turn these recommendations into action, we propose a direct partnership between NSF/federal agencies and our team to pilot Workforce AI in the federal environment. We urge the NSF to 
consider Workforce AI as a flagship example of AI-driven workforce augmentation in its AI 
Action Plan and to facilitate introductions with agencies where our solution can immediately 
contribute. Specifically: 
§Launch Pilot Programs: We invite federal agencies (perhaps via NSF’s coordination) to pilot
Workforce AI in select departments or use cases. Our proposed pilot structure includes a
90-day duration, starting with a kickoff meeting to define success metrics (e.g., hours saved,
user satisfaction scores), followed by weekly check-ins, and concluding with a report on
outcomes. We will provide dedicated support, including training sessions and integration
assistance, to ensure smooth rollout and measurable results. For instance, piloting our AI
assistant in an agency’s HR department, grants management team, or customer service center
could rapidly validate the benefits outlined above. We are prepared to offer pilot-ready
modules of Workforce AI that address common government needs (such as an AI knowledgeassistant for policy manuals, or an AI task helper for form processing). These pilots can be set
up quickly, and we will work closely with agency stakeholders to define success metrics and
ensure a smooth rollout. Our team will also capture metrics and user feedback throughout the
pilot to quantify improvements in productivity, response times, and employee satisfaction. The
insights gained can directly inform the AI Action Plan’s final recommendations and help build
a case for larger scale deployments. In short, we stand ready to be a testbed and early success
story for the federal AI workforce augmentation initiative.
§Schedule Demonstrations and Meetings: We welcome the opportunity to present
Workforce AI in detail to NSF leaders and federal stakeholders. A live demonstration
would showcase how an end-user interacts with Workforce AI’s intuitive interface and how
the system delivers value in seconds. We can tailor demo scenarios to government contexts
(e.g., an employee asking the AI to summarize the latest policy update, or to pull statistics for
a briefing). Seeing the ease and power of our platform firsthand will reinforce the points made

the technology but also discuss implementation strategies, security and compliance 
(Workforce AI is designed with federal security requirements in mind), and how it aligns with 
specific Agency missions. Such discussions will help identify the best initial use cases and 
address any questions early, smoothing the path for pilot approval. Our calendar is open to 
meet at NSF’s convenience - the sooner we connect, the sooner we can turn AI policy into on-the-ground results. 
§Forge Strategic Partnerships: Beyond pilots, we are eager to form longer-term partnerships
with federal agencies and research institutions to advance AI workforce augmentation. This
could include cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), joint innovation
labs, or inclusion in any AI Centers of Excellence that the Action Plan envisions. By
partnering with Workforce AI, the government can leverage our ongoing R&D in areas likeexplainable AI, domain-specific knowledge models, and user experience enhancements for
public-sector workflows. We, in turn, benefit from real-world usage that guides our product
refinement. It’s a mutually beneficial cycle of innovation. We are also open to collaborating
on grant proposals or sandbox programs that NSF might sponsor to study AI’s impact on
the workforce. If NSF plans to fund testbeds or academic-government-industry collaborationsas part of the Action Plan, we would be excited to contribute our platform and expertise. Our
goal is to ensure that federal employees have a voice in shaping the AI tools they use - and
partnership is the vehicle to achieve that.
§Prepare for Scaled Procurement: Finally, as the AI Action Plan moves toward execution,we want to ensure Workforce AI is well-positioned for any future procurement
opportunities that arise. We ask NSF for guidance on upcoming acquisition programs orinnovation challenges that align with our solution. Knowing the timelines and criteria in
advance will help us align resources and possibly tailor certain features for federal needs. We
are already investing in the compliance and certification aspects that would make adoption ingovernment seamless. As policies and RFI responses turn into RFPs and contracts, Workforce
AI will be ready to compete and win on the merits of its value proposition. We simply seeka fair opportunity to demonstrate that value at scale. The call to action here is: keep human-
centric AI like Workforce AI in focus as the government defines its acquisition roadmaps, and
leverage the private sector innovation available rather than building from scratch. We are oneof the innovative firms eager to serve.

7.0 CLOSING 
We urge the National Science Foundation and federal AI leaders to move decisively in adopting 
AI-driven workforce augmentation - and to do so in a way that emphasizes usability, real-world adoption, and human empowerment. Workforce AI stands ready as a willing and able partner to 
achieve those goals. By implementing our policy recommendations and initiating pilot programs, 
the federal government can unlock dramatically higher productivity, improved employee 
satisfaction, and substantial cost savings - positioning the United States as a model employer 
in the new AI era. 
Analysts predict AI could boost overall labor efficiency by about 30% and save thousands of 
hours across federal agencies, but only if deployed effectively. Let’s seize this moment with a 
solution built for real usage: an intuitive, humanlike digital employee that complements existing 
staff rather than complicating their work. In doing so, the government can strengthen 
operational efficiency, uphold security and transparency standards, and reinforce 
America’s leadership in AI innovation. 
Workforce AI is a strategic asset that can empower the federal workforce, drive operational 
efficiency, and supports the U.S. in its quest for technological leadership. By embedding our 
easy-to-use AI into existing systems, we embody the principles of innovation, American 
entrepreneurial scrappiness, risk management, and sustainable growth. We invite federal stakeholders to partner with us in pilot programs to reinvent the workforce: as Americans, we 
must dream big about AI’s limitless potential – and then be pragmatic enough to ensure it truly 
meets human needs. By anchoring AI in simplicity and human-centric design, Workforce AI will 
help unlock a new era of productivity that preserves empathy, oversight, and trust. 
We appreciate your consideration of this response and look forward to helping implement 
the National AI Action Plan. To explore next steps, we welcome the opportunity to schedule a 
demonstration or meeting. Together, we can empower the federal workforce with approachable, 
human-centric AI and set a bold example of public sector innovation. We stand ready to 
partner with agencies in realizing an AI-augmented future that benefits everyone. 
Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. We look forward to collaborating on making the 
vision of an AI-augmented federal workforce a reality.
