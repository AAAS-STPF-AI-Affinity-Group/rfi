General Comment
I feel that AI is m ostly bad for people in general. Not only is corporations trying to replace hum an labor with a m achine that spits out
m ediocre and souless work, it also m akes it so we don't take the tim e to learn new skills. If AI is there, why learn how to gram m ar check
yourself? Why learn how to code? It's the sam e idea as using m aps apps to m e. I used to know the city I lived in before I got a sm art
phone, but after m oving to a new city, I have never had a reason to learn the city since I have directions everywhere. Apply that to far
m ore aspects of life, and we are all just going to get dum ber. That doesn't include the environm ental effects it has as well. Overall it is very
anti hum an.
