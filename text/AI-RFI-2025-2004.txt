General Comment
I don't think AI is of benefit to Am erica and shouldn't be given any benefit from  the governm ent. The com panies and people who have
created the large language m odels and generative im age and video m odels have violated m illions of copyrighted works without
com pensation to their creators and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
