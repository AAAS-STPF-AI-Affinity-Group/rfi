General Comment
AI com panies should not be given legal precedent to steal creative, education, archival, or any form s of m edia. Many such businesses and
their supporters have stated a desire to end the careers of artists, writers, researchers by com piling their carefully curated work into piles
of random ly generated m ush. The process of training AI is not critical of, educational towards, and does not parody the source m aterial it
uses, the m achine has no sense of hum or, it can not exaggerate, and it can not im itate, because such actions require a m ind with which to
display intent, which AI has none, it sim ply random izes data to generate a specific outcom e as closely as possible. To use other m edia for
their own works, artist, journalist, and writers have to pay for the right to do so, and so should AI com panies. There is no reason to give
them  carte blanche to do as they please to steal the hard work of others and feed it to a m achine that will m ake worse art, generate
incorrect inform ation for people seeking answers, and m ake every system  it touches worse, as we've already observed with com panies
like Google whose search engine gets worse and less useful by the day. Allowing this will only feed the bubble that will inevitably pop, and
will ruin m any m ore lives along the way. Don't. Do it.
