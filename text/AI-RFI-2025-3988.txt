General Comment
Hello, I am  a writer who shares m y work online, as well as an avid consum er of m any art form s. I do not think the proposed regulations
give enough consideration to protecting artists from  having their work non-consensually consum ed by AI m odels. I, and m ost artists I'm
acquainted with, do not want their hard work used by AI to develop facsim iles of world of art. Furtherm ore, I believe that in this age of
ram pant m isinform ation, AI is m ore of a threat than an opportunity. The m ore advanced it becom es, the m ore the public will be inundated
with fake stuff. AI does not represent the pinnacle of hum an innovation or beautiful art: that only com es from  exercising and stretching our
m inds and putting forth effort. The federal governm ent should be prom oting that kind of work, and education, inspiring folks to reach their
potential--not getting caught up in an AI arm s race. That is com pletely m isguided and antithetical to the hum an experience.
