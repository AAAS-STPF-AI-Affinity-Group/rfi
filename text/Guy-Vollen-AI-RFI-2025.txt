To Whom It May Concern:
As a private citizen, I am AGAINST loosening copyright protections or any other legal
protections and regulations for the benefit of private companies engaged in so-called "AI" or"Artificial Intelligence" research. The pipe dream of computer-generated art and expression isat best an excuse to devalue human labor and thought. My words and thoughts are more thanmere fodder for "training" a computer to approximate my human birthright of free expression.Thank you for your time.Guy Vollen
