General Comment
Rescinding EO 14110 was a m istake.
AI system s m ust be developed in a responsible m anner. If they are not, this will create a trem endous am ount of risk for m any existing
sectors of the econom y, with only speculative upside on new and unproven technology. Many Am erican jobs will be put at risk as a result.
Specifically, allowing for copyrighted works to be used as training data without com pensation to their creators, this will not only result in
what am ounts to legalized theft of intellectual property, but will also chill the creation of new works of a sim ilar nature. As these new AI
system s have yet to prove them selves in the ability to create sim ilarly com petent works, the end result of this will be the destruction of
these industries in which the United States has been a global leader for decades.
If this adm inistration wishes to im prove the Am erican econom y, as it so claim s, it m ust take care not to destroy what is already working
for m illions of highly-skilled Am ericans.
