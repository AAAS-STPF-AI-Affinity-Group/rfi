General Comment
Unrestricted access and use of all Am ericans' personal and professional works is one of the m ost un-Am erican ideas possible, and should
not be perm itted in a free and just society. Additionally, OpenAI has not shown them selves to be sufficiently innovative, transform ative, or
useful to be given the billions upon billions of dollars they have m anaged to shake from  governm ent and private interests, let alone such
extrem e rights above those that any ordinary citizen or business m ay enjoy. I would sooner see the governm ent fund their own AI research
and developm ent independently than get further into bed with OpenAI
