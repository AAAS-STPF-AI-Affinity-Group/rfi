Cordial greetings,
This proposal is one of the most rock stupid things I've ever seen, throwing out a century of aestablished copyright law for the benefit of thieving technocrats. If there was actually anyintegrity in this administration the proposal would have been laughed off as the childishlyidiotic nonsense that it is, but since that's not the case, I will simply register my obviousopposition to this stupid, stupid, stupid imperial decree.
Sincerely,
A Tranny Bitch
