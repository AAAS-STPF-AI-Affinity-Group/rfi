"AI" is one of the dumbest thing tech-bros have shat into mainstream to win some quick bucks 
from the pockets of dumb conglomerates. It's not actual artificial intelligence, it is just 
generative slop that is taken from actual sources and actual people's hard work. 
If AI was being developed as a tool to actually help and not steal people's works, it would be 
something worth considering. There are too many bad actors that are jumping on the AI 
bandwagon to try getting a quick profit while stealing from the work of the actual people who 
are in turn getting screwed over by the mega-corps and s $%^ industry.
F&^% "AI" and f&^% off tech-bros. Also Trump, Elon, and their dumb-a &^% cronies can 
choke on a rock-hard, dry &^%$ for all I care.
Respectfully,
Der Vang
