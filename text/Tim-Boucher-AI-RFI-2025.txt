Introduc#on  & Context : 
This document is a submission to the Na6onal Science Founda6on’ s Request for Informa6on on 
the Development of an Ar6ﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Ac6on Plan [FR Doc. 2025-02305], following 
the White House’s January 23, 2025 Execu6ve Order, en6tled “Removing Barriers to American 
Leadership in Ar6ﬁcial Intelligence .” The purpose of that Order and subsequent Ac6on Plan are 
to: 
“…sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human 
ﬂourishing, economic compe::veness, and na:onal security.” 
The following consists of tes6mony from an ar6st and author at the forefront of using ar6ﬁcial intelligence  tools for crea6ve produc6on, whose work has been cited by the U nited States 
Copyright Oﬃce in its most recent report, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s Senate tes6mony , Authors 
Alliance , Coali6on for Crea6vity , and in countless media outlets around the world. 
The Case for Reforming or Disbanding the U.S. Copyright Office  
Key Points : 
• The U.S. Copyright Office enforces a human authorship requirement that is not explicitly
stated in the Copyright Act.
• Countries like China, the UK, and Canada recognize certain AI-assisted works, while the
U.S. Copyright Office’s restrictive stance puts American creators at a huge disadvantage.
• Under the Berne Convention, foreign AI-assisted works may receive stronger protection
than those created by American citizens.
• Copyright is automatic under U.S. law, yet the Office maintains an outdated and costly
registration system.
• Many of the Copyright Office’s functions could be automated or eliminated without
affecting copyright protections.

 Page 2 of 5 High-Level Recommendations: 
• Explicitly adopt as law protections for computer-generated artworks, like the United 
Kingdom.  
• Reduce or eliminate the U.S. Copyright Office’s role to remove unnecessary barriers for 
U.S. creators. 
• Strip the Office of its authority to impose policies not explicitly grounded in the 
Copyright Act. 
• Remove the registration requirement for copyright enforcement in court. 
• Align U.S. copyright policy with modern technological realities to maintain global 
competitiveness. 
Genera#ve AI Outputs & Copyrightability 
 In 2024, the US Copyright Oﬃce held a public consulta6on regarding ar6ﬁcial intelligence and copyright, receiving over ten thousand submissions (our original response to which is available 
here  for further reference). From its analysis of submissions, the USCO released in January 
2025, Part 2 of its Copyright and Ar6ﬁcial Intelligence report on Copyrightability In it, the Oﬃce 
re-asserted its posi6on that AI-generated artworks cannot be copyrighted unless they meet a 
s6ll somewhat vague threshold of human authorship.  This decision has broad implica6ons for creators, businesses, and the evolving role of AI in ar6s6c and commercial work. While the ruling appears to align with the Oﬃce’s long-standing posi6on that copyright requires human authorship, it raises important ques6ons about whether exis6ng copyright law is keeping pace with technological change. Other countries, including the UK, Canada, and China, are taking diﬀerent approaches, and recogniz e AI-assisted crea6vity to 
varying degrees. 
 
The issue is not just about AI; it highlights broader concerns about the eﬃciency and purpose of the U.S. Copyright Oﬃce in the modern technological age, and how it rigidly applies policies that are not explicitly outlined in copyright law. It also raises ques6ons about how these interpreta6ons aﬀect U.S. compe66veness in emerging crea6ve industries. If AI-generated works are given stronger recogni6on abroad, U.S. creators and businesses may be forced to 
navigate complex legal uncertain6es that their foreign counterparts do not face, and will be subject to perverse incen6ves to register their intellectual property abroad under more favorable reg ulatory regimes . 
 With the rise of AI bringing copyright law to  a crossroads, now is the 6me to assess whether the 
Copyright Oﬃce’s current role and structure serve the needs of a rapidly evolving crea6ve and technological landscape.

According to its March 2023 Senate budget wrihen statement, the USCO requested for the ﬁscal year of 2024, “an overall budget of $103.1 million in funding and 481 full 6me employees (FTEs).” By way of comparison, the Canadian Intellectual Property Oﬃce - which also handles patents and trademarks on top of copyright - employed only around 1,000 people (as of 2019), 
and the United Kingdo m’s Intellectual Property Oﬃce some 1,600. (In the US, the Patent & 
Trademark Oﬃce sepa ratel y from the USCO employ s some 14,5000 people.) 
 Canada’s CIPO, unlike the US Copyright Oﬃce, does not review or assess submissions for copyrigh t registra6ons. They  are granted automa6cally, and if there proves to be  an issue, it 
ends up  being decided in court (which is ul6mately what happens in the United States as well, 
despite the formal approval process required by the USCO).   The U nited Kingdom’ s Intellectual Property Oﬃce takes it even a step farther: the government 
does not act as a copyright register at all. Since Bri6sh law (much like Americ an law) asserts 
copyright is automa6c when works are created in ﬁxed form, registra6on is considered  
extraneous. Further, in the UK , compu ter-generated works have been oﬃcially copyrightable 
since 1988, with the owner of the copyright being the person who arranged to have the work produced. (It is worth no6ng that their crea6ve economy has not collapsed as a result.) 
 Clearly, the US Copyright Oﬃce arose from a diﬀerent set of circumstances and responds to a 
diﬀerent legal context than the Intellectual Property Oﬃces of the UK and Canada. But the present proposal submits that merely because something is well-established does not mean it should be immune from radical change to a more suitable contemporary fo rm. It is our posi6on 
that much of the present func6on of the USCO could be eliminated, and the rest largely automated.  Lack of Statu tory Gro unding 
A key concern with the U.S. Copyright Office’s approach is that it continues to enforce policies that are not explicitly required by law but instead stem from its own internal interpretations. 
The requirement for human authorship is not found in the Copyright Act itself but is an administrative rule derived from the Office’s Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices. This means that rather than carrying the force of law as passed by Congress, these policies are 
discretionary decisions made within a bureaucratic framework. While courts often defer to the 
Copyright Office’s interpretations, there is no binding requirement that they must do so, and it remains an open question whether this approach will hold up in the long term as AI becomes more deeply integrated into creative industries. 
This lack of statutory grounding raises the question of whether the Copyright Office has 
overstepped its role. The agency was not explicitly created by the Copyright Act but rather emerged from administrative necessity within the Library of Congress. It has since grown into a

 Page 4 of 5 bureaucratic institution that not only processes registrations but also influences major policy 
debates and public opinion, often shaping copyright enforcement in ways that go beyond the scope of its original mandate. Given that copyright is automatic under U.S. law, the need for a 
large and expensive registration office is increasingly questionable, particularly when compared to more streamlined systems abroad (such as the Canadian system of optional and automatically-approved registrations, or the British system of no official registration being required at all). 
Cultural works created by artists and other creators should not be bound by arbitrary 
technological restrictions or subject to approval by bureaucrats removed from the creative process. If copyright in the U.S. is automatic, there is no justification for additional bureaucratic gatekeeping. The rights in a work should not vanish simply because an artist chose one tool over another. 
Global Competitive Disadvantage  
The U.S. Copyright Office’s reluctance to recognize AI-generated works also puts it out of step 
with an increasing number of global competitors. While some countries, like Japan, have taken 
a more restrictive approach similar to the U.S., others—including China —have begun granting 
legal protections to AI-generated works in some cases. China’s approach in particular 
demonstrates a willingness to engage with the realities of AI-driven content creation, where AI 
is considered as just another tool to enable expression by human creators. Meanwhile, the U.S. 
Copyright Office remains locked in an antiquated anti-innovation interpretation that could 
leave American businesses and creators at a disadvantage. If foreign jurisdictions develop clearer legal frameworks for AI-generated works, U.S. creators may be left with weaker protections and more uncertainty than their counterparts abroad. 
Berne Convention Inconsistencies 
Another layer of complexity arises from the U.S.’s obligations under the Berne Convention. 
Under Berne, member states must provide equal copyright protections to works created in 
other member countries, meaning that a work copyrighted in another jurisdiction should receive the same protections in the U.S. as a domestically created work. If AI-generated works are recognized as copyrighted  works of intellectual property even in a communist country like 
China, while American creators are denied copyright of their AI-assisted works in the U.S., it raises concerning potential legal inconsistencies. Foreign creators whose works are protected in 
their home countries might end up be ing entitled to more recognition in the U.S. than domestic 
creators whose AI-generated works are rejected outright by the Copyright Office. 
A Call For Radical Reform 
If the U.S. Copyright Office’s current structure is making the United States less competitive and 
discouraging innovation in the field of AI and computer-generated works, it is worth asking whether the agency remains necessary in its current form. The fact that copyright is already

 Page 5 of 5 automatic under U.S. law suggests that the role of the Copyright Office could be drastically 
reduced without harming creators. If other major economies function without an extensive copyright registration system, the U.S. could do the same, particularly as digital record-keeping and AI-driven digital content and licensing management systems continue to improve. 
At the very least, reforms should be considered to remove unnecessary barriers for U.S. 
creators. Eliminating the registration requirement for enforcement in court would be a logical 
step, as would reducing the Copyright Office’s authority to impose interpretive policies that go 
beyond the text of the Copyright Act. More fundamentally, the question must be asked whether the Copyright Office itself is still necessary in an era where copyright is automatic and many of its functions could be replaced by modernized, technology-driven solutions.
