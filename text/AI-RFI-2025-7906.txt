General Comment
I believe that journalists, artists, academ ics and any other content creators should be fairly com pensated for their work. I believe that does
not happen when LLMs and sim ilar m echanism s use content without perm ission or com pensation for m achine learning that results in
downstream  profit for the offending party at the expense of the originating party.
If com panies like OpenAI want to use content from  journalists, they should com pensate journalists for that priviledge.
