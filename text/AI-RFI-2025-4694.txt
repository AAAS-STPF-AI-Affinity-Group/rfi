General Comment
OpenAI and all generative AI products are not m atters of national security, they are a quick dollar to be m ade in place of real hum an
creativity and do not hold any future for Am erica and the rest of the world. Allowing m odels to scrape and train off of anything the Internet
holds will, at best, am ount to an expensive toy, and at worst, will inundate the Internet proper with valueless "content" that will be used to
endlessly and cyclically train itself with. There is no "national security threat" to keeping the law and requiring perm ission and due
com pensation for a com pany to use copyrighted work in any capacity. In fact, this change would have the exact opposite effect in that
OpenAI would have access to private legal docum ents and im ages to train from  so long as they exist on the Internet. Please do not allow
OpenAI to bend the law around their own agenda.
