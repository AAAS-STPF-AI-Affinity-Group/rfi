General Comment
AI com panies have been violating copyright laws nonstop for the last few years, and now they want to escape consequence for those
unscrupulous actions by begging for a retroactive exception to those laws.
Instead they m ust be held accountable; forced to clearly label any AI output as such, forced to disclose what content was used to train
their AI, forced to rem ove any content that the copyright owners do not want them  to use, and forced to com pensate copyright owners
via licensing agreem ents.
With proper transparency and enforcem ent of legal boundaries that already exist instead of tearing them  down, Generative AI could co-
exist with hum an creativty, but in it's current state, it seeks only to steal and replace it.
