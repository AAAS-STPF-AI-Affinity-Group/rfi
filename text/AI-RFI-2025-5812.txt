General Comment
I work in tech. It is critically im portant to have strong, sm art regulatory guardrails in place now, because fixes after the fact of harm  are
going to be too late. People have rights to their data and their creative property; these need to be preserved. Keeping people safe and
their copyrights intact will hardly slow the developm ent of AI at all, given the current pace. Instead, it will help developers m ake wiser,
hum an-centered decisions. This doesn't need to be a conflict if regulators can listen to creators and work together, instead of in
opposition. As it is, this action plan proposes harm , not help.
Fair com pensation for work.
Hum an-centric developm ent.
Well-regulated, safe AI.
