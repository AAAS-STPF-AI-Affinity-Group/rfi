General Comment
AI is horrible. It is built on stealing, plagiarism  and laziness. I do not believe that AI is a useful tool in any way shape or form . I am  a
teacher and I am  seeing how this tool is ruining students' abilities to do work. It is a horrible, disgusting tool for m isinform ation -- and that's
not even taking into account how bad it is for the environm ent. 
AI steals from  people's livelihoods in order to create regurgitated slop, and profits off of theft. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of
the Am erican public.
