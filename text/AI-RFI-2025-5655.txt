General Comment
This is an outrageous and hideous overstep. Copyright and intellectual property laws and regulations are am ong som e of our m ost
im portant safeguards from  very, VERY costly and tim e consum ing litigation in this country and around the world. Feeding protected
creative works into a slop generating, resource-sucking em barrassm ent of a com pany like OpenAI cannot be allowed. If a com pany can't
survive without stealing from  everyone else, they shouldn't be in business. If McDonald's runs out of French fries, they don't go around
robbing Wendy's and Burgers King, snatching fries from  the kitchen AND right from  the custom ers' trays. Why would we let a tech
com pany do anything rem otely like that? It's unprofessional at best. Certainly not worthy of funneling m oney into when we could be-oh I
don't know-funding cancer treatm ents and research. OpenAI is a true source of financial waste. The governm ent shouldn't give them  the
tim e of day, m uch less access to all of the info they want. Stop shoveling resources into a gaping m aw that does nothing but steal and try
to sell you gold painted turds claim ing their 24k nuggets. Am ericans don't want any m ore "nuggets", we want som e dam n accountability.
