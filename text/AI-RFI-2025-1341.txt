General Comment
We need strong people first regulation for AI. Opt out agreem ents are 1000% unacceptable, it’s im possible for everyday workers to
constantly check who is stealing their work for their data sets. Copyright for hum an work needs to be enforced ASAP or stronger laws
protecting hum an work from  tech com pany’s profiting off our work without our consent need to be set. All current m odels are full of
stolen work, the only acceptable path forward is to perform  algorithm ic disgorgem ent on the all the data sets containing opted in data.
Com pletely unacceptable business m odel to operate on theft.
