General Comment
We should not under any circum stances give these com panies free reign to use copyright m aterials to train their technologies. These tools
are not being used in ways to prom ote and protect the needs of hum ankind, and until these technologies are being used prim arily for the
benefit of the largest num ber of hum an beings possible, they do not deserve greater freedom  from  regulation. They deserve stricter
regulation.
