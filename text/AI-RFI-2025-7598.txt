General Comment
Generative AI is theft. There's no 'm aybe', it exists only to take output from  actual people and repackage it with no com pensation. It has
no place in Am erica's future.
The output, even in an im aginary hypothetical situation where it could be ethically sourced, is substandard to that of actual hum ans, often
inaccurate, requires absurd am ount of power which puts further strain on our already fragile environm ent, and pushes real people out of
positions that a fancy algorithm  can alm ost do som ewhat com petently.
There is no future in generative AI. Do not encourage it. Do not use it. Protect original m aterial from  theft.
