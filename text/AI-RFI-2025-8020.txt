General Comment
Hey, shh, DON’T. 
I’m  a public librarian and I’ve seen the library field get flooded with AI trash over the last couple years. I’ve never seen AI help any
hum an flourish who wasn’t already the rich tech bro behind it. 
For one thing, AI-generated e-books are flooding digital collections and m aking harder for m y patrons to find the inform ation they are
actually looking for. No one wants the AI generated stuff, it clutters the filter when you are trying to find, say, The Wom en by Kristen
Hannah, no the crappy AI-generated sum m ary of the book. 
Did you know that AI generators have a high m argin of error? And “hallucinate”, m eaning the output is often things are are wholly untrue.
Why do you think this will “prom ote hum an flourishing” or “national security”??? 
TL;DR — AI is trash, don’t play with trash.
