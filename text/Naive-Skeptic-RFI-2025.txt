The fundamental problem of computer science has always been that we cannot make a machine 
do what we want completely reliably. Historically this has not mattered very much, but as 
computer systems become more powerful and influential this matters more and more. Consider 
the big CrowdStrike outage last year. AI systems are on a path towards ever -increasing power 
and influence. Systems like companies and governments are already far more powerful than 
individuals, so it seems unlikely that humans represent the  upper limit of AI capability. As AI 
systems become more powerful the amount of harm they will be able to do will increase. Unless 
the government steps in ahe trend of increasing AI capability will not stop on its own. Eventually 
the power these systems wi ll possess will mean that we will be capable of substantial harm. And 
because we cannot rely make them do what we want, they will try to do things we don't want. 
There are two fundamental challenges we face: AI Capabilities keep increasing and we do not 
know how to make AIs do what we want reliably. Government should address these areas, and 
hold AI companies to account in these areas.
