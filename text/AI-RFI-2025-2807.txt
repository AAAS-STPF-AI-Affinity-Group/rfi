General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. 
Nothing that AI brings to the am erican public is beneficial nor useful to the extent the creators of the so called ai tools lead the public to
believe. As stated aboved, it is built off theft.
