General Comment
Generative Artificial Intelligence should not be given free reign to access copy righted m aterial with im punity. It devalues the labor a
diversity of fields of expertise and creativity by m arketing itself as a short cut to producing m eaningful content. However, because
generative A.I. can only function by m odeling itself on existing works, it is inherently derivative and sabotages the production of future
works. A.I. cannot produce truly original work, and stunts innovation. 
I do not think A.I. needs to hold any place of prom inence in Am erica's future and to rely on it will only sabotage us. Attem pting to
strengthen A.I. by giving it the ability to reference any content without restriction is harm ful to Am erica's future as an innovator and leader
in any field that generative A.I. would be used in as a tool.
