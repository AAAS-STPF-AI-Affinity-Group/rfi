General Comment
I believe that Generative AI (i.e. the type of AI discussed in this Plan) is not going to be helpful to the Am erican public. I hold this opinion
because of the following reasons:
1) Generative AI is a novelty at best and useless at worst. It should not be used in ANY am ount of official capacity, and is largely
overhyped by its creators, who are m ore interested in m oney rather than creating a product that serves a purpose.
2) Generative AI in its current state cannot exist without stealing from  hum an creators. This is a fact that every single GenAI developer has
stated in legal filings. Thus it should not be funded or supported in any way until they have guaranteed the ability to pay people for their
training data AND its usage in generating prom pts.
3) Generative AI is stuck in a m urky area of copyright law. Rem oving guardrails will only confuse the m atter even further.
Generative AI has no place in the United States beyond that of theft and scam s. Keep it out. Especially anything related to Crypto.
