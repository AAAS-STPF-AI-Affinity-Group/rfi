General Comment
I am  a hardworking Am erican m an. Born and raised, lived here m y whole life. They always say that the Am erican Dream  is starting a
business and changing your life. Well I was on that path, doing well for m yself too. That is, until AI began stealing and plagiarizing from  our
com pany. Since then, we've had a lot of trouble. I write to you today to say: if you believe in Am erican business, Am erican people,
Am erican workers, you will not let this big corporations steal whatever they want from  whoever they want. Whether they are big
businesses stealing from  each other, or stealing from  sm all town and every day people. It's anti-Am erican, anti-entrepreneur, and
Am ericans will not stop fighting against this. We will take it back to court if we have to. We will class action lawsuit if we have to. AI is
dangerous, and hurting this country. If you believe the Am erican Dream  is earned, not stolen, you will not let AI use copyrighted works.
