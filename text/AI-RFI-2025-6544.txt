General Comment
Allowing unfettered access to training data only serves to destabilize the livelihoods of those who created them . This race for dom inance is
self-defeating at best and catastrophic at worst, to say nothing of the environm ental dam age that has already been done due to its energy
dem ands and would be incalculable if allowed to continue.
