General Comment
The only action that should be taken is to leave gen ai behind and let it wither on the vine. This is a bad investm ent of tim e, m oney, and
resources. 
Sam  Altm an and other ai hucksters have sold you snake oil. They prom ise the m oon but fail to deliver anything m ore than a chatbot. Look
with your eyes at how often the goalposts get m oved. Look with your eyes at how laughable google search results have becom e. Look
with your eyes at Apple intelligence m angling news headlines to the point of m alfeasance. It's a pyram id schem e, and at this point, any
investm ent in this technology will leave you holding the bag when the bubble inevitably bursts.
It's not too late to back away. If gen ai is so powerful and useful, it can surely stand on its own m erit, no? Did we have to force the iphone
onto a reluctant populace to convince them  to add it to every aspect of their life? No because it wasn't m ade of sm oke and m irrors. 
Even if you ignore the environm ental im pact, the outright theft, and how pathetic it sounds when people say they can't write an em ail
without chatgpt, you cannot deny that this is a tech sector cash grab m eant to funnel wealth from  gullible CEOs into OpenAI's coffers.
