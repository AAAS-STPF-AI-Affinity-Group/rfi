General Comment
As a sm all publisher, I produce original content for m y audience. However, AI m odels are scraping and reproducing m y work without
perm ission, threatening not just m y livelihood but the future of authentic journalism  and publishing.
If independent publishers and m edia outlets are forced out of business, there will be fewer sources of high-quality, original content. This
will create a cycle where AI is left to generate content based on increasingly low-quality or outdated inform ation, ultim ately degrading
public knowledge.
I urge you to establish stronger protections for sm all publishers, ensuring that AI com panies com pensate content creators fairly and
operate with transparency. Without im m ediate action, we risk losing the diverse, well-researched, and hum an-driven content that is
essential to a well-inform ed society.
