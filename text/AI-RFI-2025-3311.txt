General Comment
AI is an overhyped, underdelivering scam  in the vein of cryptocurrency and NFTs. Com panies like OpenAI try to turn a profit by fleecing
an under-inform ed public with im possible prom ises they cannot deliver. It’s the Dot Com  Bubble all over again.
And have we learned nothing from  Nortel? Nvidia’s downfall of over half a trillion in m arket cap in a single day, breaking records in the
process, shows just what a speculative bubble AI is! OpenAI has still yet to turn a profit and isn’t projected to for years!
By giving com panies like OpenAI access to data they do not own, we hand them  the keys to thieving from  every hard-working Am erican
and corporation. Livelihoods are at stake if this goes through. If they cannot sustain them selves without theft, they should not stand. Plus:
AI com panies becom e the m other of all data security risks by consolidating data like this, and you cannot hope to keep all the grubby
hands out of that honeypot.
Copyright exists to protect individual interests, to violate it and rem ove its protection is to freeze the free m arket. We should not m ake the
act of sharing in the public Internet a m istake! Even due com pensation will not justify this, and how do you com pensate the God-knows-
how-m any artists used to generate im ages?
