General Comment
Artificial intelligence servers not only steal m assive am ounts of data from  actual talented artists, m aking use of their own content without
their consent, they also allow com panies to stiff voice actors, writers, norm al actors, and m ore out of their jobs because it is "cheaper".
The am ount of energy required to power AI generators is also m assive am ounts of water and electricity, which can harm  the environm ent.
