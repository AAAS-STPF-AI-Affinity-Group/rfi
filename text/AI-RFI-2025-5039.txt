General Comment
Good day. I wanted to com m ent expressing m y concern for OpenAI. While AI does have its benefits, it is im perative that the
developm ent of AI be correctly regulated. The use of copyrighted m aterial in training AI is theft, and is dangerous as it hurts all aspects of
the artistic industry across the world. This especially hurts because it goes against the core values of being an Am erican, as we highly value
the opportunity to run and start our own businesses. Letting AI freely use any artist's copyrighted m aterial hurts the artist's livelihood and
discourages hum an artistic freedom . 
I hope you take this m essage and all the m essages sent into account before allowing OpenAI to steal from  artists.
Thanks for reading.
