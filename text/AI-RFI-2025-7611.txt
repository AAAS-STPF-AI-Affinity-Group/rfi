General Comment
I work in the entertainm ent industry, which relies upon flourishing creativity, and reasonable com pensation for creatives' work.
Such a policy would disincentivize creatives from  sharing their best work. Why would any creative do so, knowing that an AI can illegally
train on their copyrighted m aterial and benefit from  it financially , with little to no legal recourse available to them ? 
Why should AI com panies be exem pt from  the sam e copyright laws that bind the rest of us? Why should an AI com pany be allowed to
pirate copyrighted m aterial and benefit financially from  others' work, without those artists being properly com pensated? It's theft, pure and
sim ple.
This will destroy livelihoods and whole industries, and furtherm ore stifle creative innovation. It is incom patible with creativity in all form s.
