General Comment
Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) will cause irreparable harm  to Am erica if it is unregulated. Gen AI com panies seek to exploit
existing art and literature by using it to train their AI m odels without consent, credit, or com pensation for the original creators. This is not
fair use; this is theft. Allowing this to happen eviscerates copyright law and rem oves protections for intellectual property. This is
unconstitutional, as the right to one's hard-earned property is a fundam ental Am erican value. Furtherm ore, throwing Am erica's creative
industries under the bus by supplanting them  with Gen AI will effectively replace m anm ade content with regurgitated com puter slop. It is
inherently im possible to guarantee that all Gen AI content is reliable and of quality, so this would be both a dangerous and regressive
change. Last but not least, if creative workers are stolen from  and forced out of the industry, then the AI m odels that are reliant on their
work will ultim ately crum ble as well as they have no new m aterial to train on besides other Gen AI slop. In short, Gen AI is predatory,
unreliable, and dangerous. Please do not allow these com panies to steal with im punity, cripple Am erica's creative industry, and harm  the
Am erican people.
