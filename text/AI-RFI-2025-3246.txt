General Comment
Whatever benefits a sweeping exem ption from  the copyright system  for AI developm ent com panies would grant the US as a whole, it will
be dwarfed by the sheer am ount of m oney they will m ake via exploitation of the work of others. Private com panies privately developing
private products for sale on the open m arket should not be m ade "m ore equal than others" sim ply because they're willing to sell their
product to the governm ent. This is akin to giving Ford com plete im m unity to patent infringem ent lawsuits just because they say it's
necessary to give the US Arm y better trucks than the Russian Military. And if this does go through, it will only spur on the developm ent of
tools designed to salt artwork and text files with junk to poison AI datasets, which will then have to spend even m ore m oney working
around them  unless the governm ent m akes it illegal to draw or write things AI doesn't like.
So yeah, this isn't a good idea.
