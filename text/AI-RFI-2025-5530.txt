General Comment
I do not believe that new technology, as prom ising as it m ay sound, should com e from  the uncom pensated work of hard working
Am ericans. AI should not be able to use im ages without express perm ission of the owners of said im ages. Period. To settle for any less is
to take power away from  hard working Am ericans.
