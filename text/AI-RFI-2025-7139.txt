General Comment
AI is theft, sim ply. It’s m orally wrong, but also econom ically a scam  by tech bros trying to dangle a fancy new thing in front of geriatric
lawm akers that can not ask basic questions about the im plications of a new technology without revealing how truly ignorant they are. Have
you ever used AI and seen how truly useless it is? The results for anyone who actually knows about a subject they’re applying AI to is
com ically bad — either lazily cobbled together or straight up wrong. There was recently an AI cookbook published that poisoned
som eone. It is useless, harm ful, and tacky in every way. If strong rails are stripped away, everyone is vulnerable — including the own
im age and words of the lawm akers that support it. And there will be nothing they can do to protect their im age and intellectual property,
just like anyone else. Support it at your own peril. The kicker is, if they support it, you won’t benefit — it won’t generate a dim e of profit
for them  anyway.
