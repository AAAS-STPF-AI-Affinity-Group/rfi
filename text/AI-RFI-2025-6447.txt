General Comment
AI will take so m any im portant jobs and livelihoods including m y own and I can't stand by and watch the com m itm ent I have had to m y
craft through m y entire life as a young individual go to waste. My dream  job won't be som ething I can access and it's already hard as it is
to find a desirable job in the art field. This action plan can ruin dream s of young creators in m any different creative fields and it breaks m y
heart to see it even considered. We should not be STEALING hard work from  hardworking people.
