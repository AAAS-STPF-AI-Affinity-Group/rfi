General Comment
This is bad for creative fields and for everyone as a whole. Generative AI is little m ore than a cash grab that does not offer anything
m eaningful to society. Aside from  wasting resources, generative AI has dam aged reputations with lies m odels m ade up trying to create an
answer. It should not be an investm ent priority for the US when people are struggling to afford groceries.
