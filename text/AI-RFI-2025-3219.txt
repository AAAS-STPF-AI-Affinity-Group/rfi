General Comment
As a freelance artist and U.S. citizen I have seen the dangers of unregulated AI used in such a short am ount of tim e. These dangers not
only affect artists, writers, and other creatives but regular private citizens as well. People have long used social m edia and written on the
internet and now their data and private im ages are at risk of being fed into algorithm s which can be weaponized against anyone.
There is an ethical dilem m a which arises from  AI training, but also an environm ental im pact too. These m odels go against a persons
copyright and ownership of their own work. We have seen the harm  AI has created from  deepfakes to m im icking voices and videos of
living people. Scam m ing and crim e will only increase as these m odels are allowed to steal unchecked. Individuals safety should not be put
at risk for corporations gain.
