General Comment
To whom  it m ay concern, 
Am erica's entire capitalist system  is based on the idea that som eone should be able to profit off their labor. We have already seen that
production studious, gam ing com panies, and a host of other corporations would love to replace hum an workers with AI they do not have
to pay. 
Forget all the questions we should be asking about what it m eans to be hum an, if you need to. If groups like OpenAI are allowed to have
unfettered access to copyrighted m aterial, the creative econom y--a chief export of our nation--will cease to function, as com panies will
have no m otivation to pay hum ans. Allowing OpenAI this level of access with set them  up to m onopolize any industry that relies on hum an
creativity. As long OpenAI charges just a little less than an actual hum an, com panies will be financially incentivized to fire people in favor
or digitized facsim iles. The resulting blow to our econom y should not be underestim ated. 
This governm ent represents the people; the people have been clear: OpenAI's theft of copyrighted m aterial m ust be stopped. It certainly
m ust not be expanded.
