General Comment
I am  an artist. This would dism antle copyright law and kill m y work. We cannot let com puters m ake m anagem ent decisions and we
especially cannot give one freedom  from  legal accountability. I despise this plan and hope all are sm art enough to ensure it is swiftly ended.
This will have incredibly dam aging consequences for m any m any m any Am ericans
