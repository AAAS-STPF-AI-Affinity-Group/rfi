General Comment
I don't believe that AI is the future of the United States, even rem otely. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and m akes m y life
worse. AI is also currently an overhyped scam , m uch like NFTs and the blockchain were several years ago. Please do not let them  steal
for free.
