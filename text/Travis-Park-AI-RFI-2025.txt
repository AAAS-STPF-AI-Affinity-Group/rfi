The United States must remain at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) development to ensure 
economic growth, national security, and technological innovation. In response to the Request for 
Information (RFI) on the AI Action Plan, I propose the fol lowing key areas of focus: 1. Research & 
Development (R&D) Investment Increase federal funding for AI research in universities and public -
private partnerships to drive innovation. Expand grants through the National Science Foundation 
(NSF) and the Departme nt of Energy (DOE) for AI advancements in key industries such as 
healthcare, cybersecurity, and manufacturing. Support AI ethics and safety research to ensure 
responsible AI deployment. 2. Workforce Development & Education Implement AI -focused 
curricula in  K-12 education to build foundational skills in coding, machine learning, and data 
science. Provide federal incentives for AI training programs in higher education, vocational schools, 
and apprenticeships. Expand funding for AI workforce reskilling program s to prepare workers for AI -
driven industries. 3. AI Infrastructure & National Security Strengthen AI computing infrastructure, 
including cloud computing access and high -performance AI chip manufacturing in the U.S. 
Enhance AI capabilities in defense and c ybersecurity to protect national security assets. Establish 
public-private partnerships to ensure U.S. firms have access to cutting -edge AI tools and research. 
4.Ethical & Regulatory Frameworks Develop voluntary AI guidelines that promote ethical AI use
without stifling innovation. Encourage transparency in AI decision -making processes while
protecting intellectual property. Implement policies that prevent AI bias and ensure fairness in
automated decision -making. 5. AI Integration in Government Agencies Fe deral Efficiency &
Automation: Use AI to modernize government processes, automate administrative tasks, and
reduce operational costs in agencies such as the Social Security Administration (SSA), Internal
Revenue Service (IRS), and Department of Veterans Aff airs (VA). AI -Driven Public Services:
Implement AI for improved public services, such as chatbots for customer support in federal
agencies and predictive analytics to enhance public health and disaster response efforts. AI for
National Security & Law Enfo rcement: Expand AI applications in the Department of Defense (DoD),
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for threat
detection, cybersecurity, and border security. Data Management & Decision -Making: Develop AI -
powered data analysis tools to improve decision -making in agencies such as the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Energy (DOE). AI in Research & Space
Exploration: Enhance AI applications in NASA for deep space exploration, cl imate research, and
autonomous robotic systems. 6. International Collaboration & Leadership Strengthen alliances
with global AI leaders to set international AI standards that align with U.S. values. Lead efforts to
counter foreign adversariesâ€™ use of AI fo r cyber threats, misinformation, and economic espionage.
Promote AI diplomacy to maintain U.S. influence in global AI governance. By prioritizing these
strategic initiatives, the United States will maintain its position as a leader in artificial intelligen ce
while ensuring economic prosperity, national security, and technological excellence.
