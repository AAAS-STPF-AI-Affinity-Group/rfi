Dear Federal Register,
As an artist, I'm openly opposed to AI. AI steals from not just my livelihood, but also the
livelihood of many artists as well. AI has no place in the US now or in the future. It's alsooverhyped and is fleecing the eyes of many Americans. Going forward with this plan will havenegative consequences, and will lead the country into a destructive path. Shut it down. ASAP.
