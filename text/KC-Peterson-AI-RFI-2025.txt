Hello, I am writing to encourage a focus on reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency 
as a highest priority policy action that should be in the new AI Action Plan. AI data centers are highly 
resource intensive and are being built and operated a t a time when our energy and water usage 
should be dropping sharply in order to give young Americans a livable future. In order to be worthy 
of the high resource usage, AI should only be used to solve our greatest problems, not be a 
ubiquitous and superflu ous internet enhancer. Data centers should mitigate the carbon emissions 
associated with AI's energy consumption by transitioning to renewable energy sources such as 
solar or wind and adopting energy -efficient practices. AI must have net zero emissions to keep pace 
with international climate goals. If AI does not comply with net -zero emissions, it will only serve to 
hasten and magnify human suffering rather than being the boon is proports to be. Unless 
governments are using AI to redesign their power grid a nd its transmission, to inform mass 
reforestation efforts, and compelling the protection of the Colorado River, the current allocation of 
precious and irreplaceable resources to AI data centers negates its outputs. Thank you for taking 
my comment, KC Peter sen
