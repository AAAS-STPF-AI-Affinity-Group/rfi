General Comment
I strongly disagree with the idea of allowing AI to scrape copyrighted content. It should only be legal if the artist consents.
AI is not the future, especially not for anything creative. People want art and stories that have soul. Art that has a touch of the artist in it,
that authentic glim pse into the hum an experience. AI will not and never will have that, and audiences will know it.
I don't want m y tax m oney going toward AI in any way. It's a waste of tim e, energy, and both taxpayer and shareholder m oney. It won't
im prove the quality of life of the Am erican people, and that's m ore im portant than beating China in this pointless technology race. 
We should be focusing this energy on healthcare and education if anything, not AI.
