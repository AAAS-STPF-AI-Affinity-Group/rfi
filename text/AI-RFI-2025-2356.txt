General Comment
As a m usician and a gam e developer, allowing com panies like OpenAI and Google to artificial intelligence m odels on works which should
be and are currently protected by copyright law would kill m y ability to create m y works and halt m y ability to earn incom e. Please shut
down this insanity, AI m odels are already able to use publicly available data as training data, there is no need to rem ove copyright laws to
allow a larger pool of works for AI to train on.
