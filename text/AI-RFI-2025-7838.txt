General Comment
No, absolutely not! These A.I. com panies m ust not be allowed to override copyright protections, allowing the to cause dam age to the
livelihoods of individual and businesses alike. The sole driving force behind this is profit wrapped up in the lie of som e benefit to national
security. All these A.I. system s is use already created content to Frankenstein together so unconvincing and fake "original" creation. In
m any cases you can even still see the signature of the original creator copied over to the A.I. creation. This dangerous trend m ust not be
allowed to replace creatives and steal work that can be done by hardworking hum ans, watering down the overall creativeness of this
country for the profit of a few billionaires.
