General Comment
Generative AI based on scraping and training on copyrighted work is a civilizational dead end. It destroys the incentive to learn or create.
Take the exam ple of AI video gam e tips. I saw an article in techcrunch today hyping this as a way to enhance any gam e by having an AI
helper. The problem  is, all of these tips, all that inform ation, has to com e from  som ewhere, which requires hum ans playing the gam es and
providing inform ation for the AI to train on.
There m ust be strong copyright protection, and if generative AI cannot exist without circum venting that protection, then it should not exist
at all.
