I am writing to a sk the White House to prioritize reducing energy consumption and increasing 
efficiency in the new AI Action Plan. As AI technologies continu e to become more integrated into 
our lives, it is crucial that we address the significant energy d emands and a ssociated carbon 
emissions of these systems. The AI Action Plan should emphasize energ y efficiency as a top policy 
action. This includes investing in research and development to create more energy-efficient AI 
algorithms and hardware. By focusing on efficienc y, we can reduce the overall energ y consumption 
of AI systems without compromising their performance. Data centers, which power much of th e AI 
infrastructure, should be encourag ed to transition to renewabl e energy sour ces such as solar and 
wind. This transition is essential fo r mitigating the carbon emissions associated with AI's energy 
consumption. There should b e a clear, definitiv e timeline to achieve net-zero emissions for AI 
operations. Data centers and AI developers should likewis e adopt best practices f or energy 
efficiency, including o ptimizing cooling systems, using energy-efficient hardware, and 
implementing AI algorithms that requir e less computational power. These practices can 
significantly reduce th e energy footprint of AI operations. According to a study by the University of 
Massachusetts Amherst, training a larg e AI model can emit as much carbon as fiv e cars in their 
lifetimes. This highlights the urgent need t o address AI's energ y consumption. The International 
Energy Agency report s that data center s consume about 1% of glob al electricity demand, and this 
is expected to ris e with the increasing us e of AI. Transitioning to renewable energ y can help offset 
this growing demand. Companies lik e Google and Microsoft hav e already committ ed to achieving 
carbon-neutral data centers, demonstrating that this goal is both feasibl e and beneficial for the 
environment. A s a resident of York, Pennsylvani a, I am particularly concerne d about how AI's 
energy use may impact o ur local environment and econom y. The restart of Three Mile Island to 
power AI has many who lived thro ugh its meltdown in 1979 worri ed. By prioritizing energy efficiency 
and the transition to renewable energy, the AI Action Plan can create a sustainable futur e for AI 
technologies and help protect communities lik e ours from the adverse effects of climate c hange of 
(another) nuclear meltdown. By prioritizing energ y efficiency an d the transition to renewabl e energy, 
the AI Action Plan can lead the way in creating a sustainable future for AI technologies. Again, I ask 
the White House to incorporat e these recommendations int o the new AI Action Plan to ensure that 
AI development aligns with our climate goals.
