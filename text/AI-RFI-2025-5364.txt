General Comment
This is an irresponsible and poorly thought out m ove. This is invalidating people's work and livelihoods, as well as violating copyrights and
tradem arks. It's theft of people's work in a race to build the biggest AI, when the current AI datacenters are dem anding unsustainable
am ounts of electricity and resources.
