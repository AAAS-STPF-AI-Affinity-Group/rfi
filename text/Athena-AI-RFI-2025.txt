Introduction: The Importance of Edge AI in the National AI Policy  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the defining technological race of the 21st century, with transformative impacts on economic growth, national security, and global competitiveness. While much of the public discourse on AI focuses on cloud- based models and data centers, Edge AI —where 
AI computation occurs near data sources rather than in centralized cloud servers —represents a 
fundamental shift in AI deployment and innovation. The NSF AI Institute for Edge Computing, Athena, is at the forefront of adva ncing Edge AI research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration 
among academia, industry, and government to develop energy -efficient, real -time, and privacy -
preserving AI solutions  at the edge . This response outlines critical policy considerations necessary 
to ensure the United States maintains its leadership in AI by prioritizing investment in AI 
infrastructure, workforce development, international competitiveness, and security.  
1. The Need for Robust AI Infrastructure Investments
The U.S. must significantly increase investments in AI infrastructure, particularly in Edge AI, to keep 
pace with global competitors. While tech giants in the U.S. focus on large -scale cloud AI, other 
nations have aggressively expanded their capabilities in AI hardware, edge computing, and sovereign AI models, controlling access to AI applications for end users.  
Some countries have launched advanced AI models with greater autonomy from chip and cloud 
providers, ensuring their technological sovereignty by investing heavily in custom AI semiconductors 
and Edge AI deployments. These initiatives are designed to reduce dependency on U.S. -based AI 
technology, signaling a shift in the global AI power balance.  


To mainta in its leadership, the U.S. must:  
1.Fund Edge AI -specific research that prioritizes low -latency, energy -efficient AI models.
2.Expand semiconductor investments, particularly in custom AI accelerators optimized for
Edge AI.
3.Enhance domestic AI infrastructure by integrating AI -driven networking, edge datacenters,
and federated AI systems across industries.
Without a focused policy effort, the U.S. risks falling behind as global players advance self- sufficient 
AI ecosystems that are independent of U.S. -based AI models and cloud infrastructure.  
2. AI Workforce Development: Addressing the Talent Gap
The U.S. faces a growing shortage of AI talent, particularly in AI hardware, Edge AI, and AI 
Infrastructure . The AI race is not just about technology; it is about who develops, deploys, and 
governs AI systems.  
Current Challenges:  
1.The demand for AI engineers and AI -embedded hardware specialists far exceeds the supply.
2.Visa and immigration restrictions, along with geopolitical tensions, have limited the flow oftop AI researchers to the U.S.
3.Gaps in STEM education, declining federal funding for university research, and uneven AIliteracy create barriers to cultivating the AI workforce.
Policy  Recommendations:  
1.Increase federal support for AI research and education programs at all levels, particularly in
AI hardware, Edge AI, and AI infrastructure in general.
2.Expand public  and private AI training initiatives with industry -sponsored apprenticeships.
3.Create targeted immigration policies to attract top -tier AI talent, ensuring the U.S. retains its
intellectual edge in AI research and deployment.
Without strategic investment in AI workforce development, the U.S. risks a critical skills gap that 
could slow AI innovation and adoption.  
3. Global AI Competition: Maintaining U.S. Leadership
The global AI competition is intensifying, with other nations making strategic, long -term investments 
in the field. Unlike the U.S. AI ecosystem, which is primarily driven by the private sector, these 
nations often take a government -led approach to investing in AI research and shaping AI policy.  
Some countries have aggressively pursued AI chip sovereignty, reducing their reliance on hardware designed by U.S. companies such as NVIDIA, AMD, Intel , and Qualcomm . Instead, they are building 
AI ecosystems that operate independently of the U.S. and its allies. Others have prioritized privacy -
first, regulated AI models that align with local data governance laws, further reducing dependence on U.S. technology provider s. 


Policy  Recommendations:  
1.Ensure sustained federal investment in AI to match or exceed global competitors.
2.Foster AI infrastructure  independence, particularly in AI computing centers , AI computing
chips, and edge AI devices .
3.Encourage international AI collaborations while protecting against technology leakage to
adversarial nations.
Without  decisive action, the U.S. risks losing its competitive edge in AI research, deployment, and 
commercialization.  
4. AI Security & National Defense: The Role of Edge AI
Security remains one of the most pressing challenges in AI governance, especially in foundational AI infrastructure such as Edge AI.  
The U.S. Must Prioritize Secure Edge AI:  
1.Edge AI m inimizes attack surfaces by reducing data exposure to vulnerabilities inherent in
centralized cloud -based AI  systems.
2.Federated learning, trusted AI hardware, and other edge security technologies establish arobust framework for decentralized AI governance, mitigating risks of adversarial AIexploitation.
Policy Recommendations:  
1.Establish mandatory AI security standards for Edge AI deployment across critical AIinfrastructure.
2.Increase funding for AI research in cybersecurity, focusing on adversarial AI detection andmitigation in edge applications.
3.Strengthen defense partnerships with academia to accelerate the adoption of secure AI innational security applications.
Without a secure AI infrastructure, U.S. national security is at risk in an era of autonomous cyber warfare and AI -powered misinformation campaigns.  
Conclusion: A Call for Action  
The United States stands at a critical juncture in AI policy. To maintain its global leadership, the nation must prioritize:  
•Robust  AI infrastructure investments, particularly in Edge AI.
•AI workforce development to close the talent gap.
•Strategic responses to global AI competition.
•Security -first AI policies to safeguard national interests.
