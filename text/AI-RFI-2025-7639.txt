General Comment
As the author of 15 books, I feel com pelled to speak out against the unauthorized use of m y work by AI com panies. Let m e be
unequivocal: taking m y content without m y explicit perm ission or proper com pensation is theft. It is a blatant violation of copyright law,
which exists to protect creators like m yself from  exploitation and to ensure that intellectual property is respected. 
When AI com panies scrape, copy, or otherwise ingest m y work without consent, they are not only underm ining m y livelihood but also
eroding the very foundation of copyright law. If this practice is norm alized, it sets a dangerous precedent—a “free-for-all” where anyone’s
creative work can be taken and repurposed without accountability. Such a future would render copyright m eaningless, stripping creators
of their rights and disincentivizing the production of original works. 
I urge AI com panies to respect the intellectual property rights of authors, artists, and creators across all industries. If you want to use our
work, ask for perm ission and negotiate fair term s. Anything less is unacceptable. And giving AI com panies legal protection for theft is just
m ore theft. 
Let’s not allow technological progress to com e at the expense of creativity and fairness. Protecting copyright isn’t just about safeguarding
individual creators—it’s about preserving the integrity of art, literature, and innovation for generations to com e.
