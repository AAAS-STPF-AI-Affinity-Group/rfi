General Comment
AI only functions because of theft from  countless people and devours m assive am ounts of electricity to do nothing valuable. It is m assively
unprofitable as OpenAI loses billions of dollars every year and its product is highly inaccurate and doesn't do anything useful. Investm ent
in Generative AI will waste billions of taxpayer dollars and would condone theft of intellectual property. It is the latest tech fraud after
"crypto" and the "m etaverse". Please do not fall for this scam .
Thank you
