General Comment
If art m ade by hum ans supposedly isn't valuable, then why is it so im portant that it's given to them  for free?
This proposal to legalize theft is rife for abuse and enables widescale infringem ent from  all creative works. While the people pushing for
theft to be m ade legal probably do not see stealing from  sm aller artists as a big deal, surely, surely you can see the potential issue you're
going to face when you're stealing from  Disney.
Anything that needs to steal from  other people's effort and labor to exist should not exist at all. This is not difficult.
