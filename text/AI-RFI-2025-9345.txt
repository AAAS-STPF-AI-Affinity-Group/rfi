General Comment
By giving "Artificial Intelligence" the freedom  to ignore copyright protections in pursuit of questionable and vague goals, it will lead to the
destruction of the individual artist. If private works, previously protected by legal statutes, can be stolen in the nam e of "national security"
and "com petition" with no real yardstick to m easure the outcom es, you will destroy the cultural output, not only of this country, but of the
world.
Com panies will prosper. Individual creators, already struggling against a corporate dom inated m arket, will leave, taking their skills with
them .
And for what? To benefit a sm all group of people who devalue the work of individual authors, poets, artists, and videographers. These
"AI" developers dem and the right to steal the hard work of others, denying the value of the artists hard work, com paring it to the slop
generated by what they deliberately m isrepresent as "Artificial Intelligence." This dishonest language should raise significant concerns about
the ethical, m oral, and financial attitudes of the people seeking support from  the governm ent.
