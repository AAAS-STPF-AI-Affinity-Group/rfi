This AI plan will kill human creativity!
Many artists, photographers and others have spent their lives studying and making art. Most
have never made much money.
But true art will die if our rights as artists are not protected.Kill off human creativity and you kill off humans and humanity.What many artists create cannot be created by AI. Cos our art hasn’t been made yet.Take away our copyright protections and art will become boring, unimaginative, repetitive,
boring.
And you’ll kill artists.I have a hard enough time dealing with photo thieves. Make this the law of the land,
VIOLATE copyright laws, and you KILL ARTISTS.
I have NO will to live if this passes.I’ll give it all up. And thousands will never see my photos or read my private memories of a
time that people cherish.
And I will lose the will to live. MY art keeps me alive. And gives hope and inspiration to
thousands.
 
Are you going to pay attention to the history of art? NO AI could have done what mankind hascreated the last thousand years and longer.
