General Comment
Generative AI is, at its core, a m achine dedicated to devaluing skilled labor. The large language m odels that are all the rage in the tech
sphere are trained on work without the consent or even knowledge of those who created it, and used to create subpar am algam ations of
that work based on calculated probability rather than real knowledge or understanding. The United States does not need to achieve
dom inance in the AI sector because the technology itself is all flash and no substance on a dead-end road. What we need instead are
strong regulations that protect the people who are losing their jobs because corporations would rather divest them selves of workers with
actual skills in favor of a cheap alternative that looks like it can do the sam e, though tim e and tim e again its outputs only m ake m ore work
for those left behind. 
Private sector AI innovation needs to be strictly regulated, for the sake of the people who are losing their jobs, incom es, and livelihoods to
hype. Generative AI is ultim ately non-viable, a m assive drain on both power and water resources that delivers low-quality results, and the
United States needs strong regulations to m anage the ethical concerns regarding how m odels are trained and used.
