General Comment
I truly believe that allowing AI to use any and future inform ation to "im prove itself" is a irreversible detrim ent on not only our current
society, but also the future of Am erica. IPs from  countless industries and com panies would be in jeopardy if this is allowed to go through.
Not to m ention, num erous individuals who have already posted on the internet would be at risk of sensitive data being used by said AI.
More research and regulations m ust be put in place and suggested before this plan should even be put before congress.
