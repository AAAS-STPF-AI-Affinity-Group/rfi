General Comment
So this new proposal is essentially asking us to supply our work to Google and OpenAI for free, without com pensation. There are m any
words for that: theft, slavery and com m unism  are am ong them . In the reverse scenario where we would be allowed to take from  these
com panies' data, it would be called digital piracy.
Google and OpenAi do not have the interests of the Am erican people or that of national security in m ind. They will actively underm ine the
governm ent and will stifle all creativity and innovation killing the free m arket and capitalism  as we know it.
