In brief: stop the use of AI. Ditch it. Trash it. It serves no positive purpose for humanity, with 
many problems. It is a grift. Pull the plug. Generative AI cannot exist without theft of intellectual property and private information. It steals the work of writers, both of fiction and non-fiction, artists, photographers, film makers, and creators of all sorts without their consent and without compensation. Any compensation that has been offered is inadequate to feed their work in a machine meant to replace them forever. Generative AI cannot create. It can only imitate derivative work based on the stolen work it was trained on. It can offer no innovation. Only stagnation. Generative AI cannot think, no matter how much it is marketed to do so. It does not know what words it is saying, nor what images it produces. It cannot fact check. It creates lies at a startling pace, filling spaces of reliable information with convincing misinformation, obscuring truths. Such poisoning of the well of knowledge only benefits those who wish to take advantage of others' ignorance. Generative AI is catastrophic to the environment. The amount of energy and water used is immense for even small amounts of generated text or images. Energy costs for regular Americans skyrocket as energy is siphoned to data centers generating text and images. Such energy and water use hastens climate change which will bring resource scarcity and an increase in natural disasters. It does nothing for the American people but harm them. It must stop.
