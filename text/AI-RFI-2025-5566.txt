General Comment
If it is necessary for the US to develop an “Action Plan” with regard to large language m odels (which have been incorrectly labeled
“artificial intelligence” by those seeking to profit from  them ), then such a plan m ust include strict protection of copyrighted m aterial. LLM
developers m ust observe all existing copyright law when seeking training m aterials for their m odels; unauthorized use of copyrighted
m aterials (including m aterials published online) for the training of LLMs constitutes theft. Any US governm ent policy regarding the use of
copyrighted m aterial for LLM training m ust include clear rules and strict penalties for those who break those rules. 
The policy m ust also establish clear guidelines for accountability in decision-m aking processes that em ploy LLMs. If a US governm ent
agency em ploys LLMs in a way that harm s a hum an, a hum an being m ust be held accountable. Agencies m ust not be allowed to shirk
responsibility for harm s by blam ing an LLM.
