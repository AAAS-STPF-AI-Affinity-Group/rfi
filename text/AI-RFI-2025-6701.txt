General Comment
Allowing copyright law to be skirted by com panies for AI developm ent has already been shown to be a disaster by the am ount of
derivative and borderline illegal content being shown to children on platform s like YouTube and TikTok, while I personally care little
about shareholders, as a party who largely takes influence from  corporations, you should plainly see that this would only further to anger
them , allowing anyone to use this software to not only steal the works of individuals, but full fledged copy written properties, effectively
m aking the entire idea of copyright for artistic work useless. This would be a killing blow to art of all kind across the internet, and frankly I
wouldnâ€™t be surprised if that was the intention of such a blatantly poorly thought out proposal.
