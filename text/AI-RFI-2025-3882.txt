General Comment
Current AI operations are a full threat to not only copyright writ large, but all Am erican culture and arts businesses and com m unities.
Many AI com panies struggle to find a use for their technology that produces any profit at all, this sim ply hasn't proven to be a theater of
any value yet, hardly different from  trying to m ake Am erica dom inant in the field of solitaire. Em powering these AI organizations in the
wrong way will gut our culture and art as AI scrapes them  all while struggling to find a path to profit. The technology has som e incredible
prom ise, but not if it m eans gutting the arts and culture we've built in this long Am erican history.
