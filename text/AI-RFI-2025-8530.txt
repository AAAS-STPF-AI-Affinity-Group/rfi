General Comment
While m achine learning is a valuable technological tool that the U.S. should absolutely be pursuing in the furtherance of various fields,
LLMs and generative im age Ai are a waste of resources, a dead-end ouroboros that serves no ends but the ruination of the inform ation
ecosystem  that is the internet and the stupefaction of our collective language skills. In addition, they run roughshod over the intellectual
property rights of countless writers, m usicians, visual artists, and various other creatives.
Any regulatory fram ework that continues to abet this exploitation is dangerously short-sighted and should be vehem ently opposed, and in
fact steps should be taken to unwind the dam age already done to the work and livelihoods of the innum erable individuals who have had
their creations hoovered up by these engines of m ediocrity and dreck. 
I urge the NSF to bring AI to heel. Thank you for your tim e and consideration.
