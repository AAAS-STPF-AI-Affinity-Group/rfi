General Comment
As a professional writer working in tech over the past 20 years, I can attest that the use of copyrighted m aterials to train generative AI
directly harm s the livelihoods of writers, designers, com m ercial illustrators, videographers, and professionals in m any m ore fields.
Perm itting it would im pact tens of thousands of Am erican workers and produce zero efficienciesâ€”all it does is increase shareholder value
for a handful of com panies.
