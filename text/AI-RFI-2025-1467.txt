General Comment
AI in the US has been created using stolen copyrighted data. OpenAI and other countries broke copyright laws, have lied to investors and
the public about the capabilities of AI, and aim  to use these apps to reclassify skilled professions as contract work or entry level in order
to break labor unions and exploit workers. The power required to run these m odels threaten current grid capacity and increasingly
depleted water resources. 
AI is scam  that hurts workers, harm s the environm ent and uses valuable water, and was built on stolen property. It is the new “self-
driving” car, just utter bs from  grifters.
