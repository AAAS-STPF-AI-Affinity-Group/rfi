General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. As an Am erican artist and writer, AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican
and profits off of theft. AI is over hyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. To give openAI special treatm ent in the context of
copyright is not only a hypocritical and unethical thing for the governm ent to condone, it calls into question the very notion of copyright
law. Why should one com pany be allowed to break the law and steal other's work while the rest of us and other com panies m ust stand by
and let their work be stolen, all the while forced to follow the law that others don't follow. Please, do not allow openai nor anyother ai
com pany to freely break copyright law. There are other ways to use and train ai data without resorting to theft.
