General Comment
I am  deeply concerned about our over reliance of AI technology, especially with it being a threat to the security of the Am erican privacy.
Why does AI needs increasingly larger and larger am ounts of inform ation, stealing from  artists, writers, and other jobs we need to support
ourselves? Do we have right to keep our inform ation secure from  AI? I do not trust AI or any business, institution, com pany, or governing
body that uses AI.
Furtherm ore, AI com panies want to strip our copyright. This threatens thousands of creative and talented artists, authors, m usicians, and
the entire creative field. AI threatens m y copyright of m y art and creative skills. I want to use m y art to support m y career in Art. Do not
let AI com panies take that away.
