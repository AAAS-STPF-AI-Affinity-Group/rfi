General Comment
I do not believe that AI has a place in the future of the US. Generative AI can only function on the backs of stolen work from  creators big
and sm all, and creates an adverse effect on those creators as AI generates work which takes credit for the real artists. AI has consistently
and repeatedly been proven to give wrong, inaccurate, or fabricated inform ation, and as such, has absolutely no place in our federal
governm ent or in the futures of Am ericans.
