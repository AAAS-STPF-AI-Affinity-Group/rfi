General Comment
This is unacceptable. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States, and is quite frankly em barrassing that itâ€™s gotten
this bad. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft of thousands if not m illions of individuals WHO DID NOT
CONSENT. We cannot allow for AI to be protected and unregulated. Please consider how harm ful AI is to, not only your fellow
Am ericans, but to our environm ent as a whole. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. This is NOT what we
want.
