General Comment
I do not believe AI technology deserves a future in the US. AI technology is theft in every sense of the word, as AI algorithm s scrape and
plagiarize im ages and written works m ade by people. AI also contributes to large scale m isinform ation by synthesizing unchecked
inform ation. Allowing the influence of AI to grow only hurts Am ericaâ€™s future by polluting public knowledge.
