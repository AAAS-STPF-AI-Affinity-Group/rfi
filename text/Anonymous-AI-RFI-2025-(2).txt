This executive order, to put it plainly, is embarrassing to the nation in its current state. Breaking 
down 'why' into a list, this technology is: Environmentally unfriendly. Full stop. Its wasting obscene 
amounts of water: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cind ygordon/2024/02/25/ai -is-accelerating -the-
loss-of-our-scarcest-natural-resource -water/ It's pollution costs are staggering:

needs of AI are straining our power grid: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024 -ai-power-

several notable professionals to raise alarm bells for safety and regul atory concerns. Outside of 
being environmentally unfriendly, Generative AI in particular is the subject of ongoing litigation in 
courts all over the globe (against multiple companies responsible for creating it, and allegedly 
sourcing their datasets unethi cally.) https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/using -

position of power that stands to benefit from a massive investment in this technology (Elon Musk.) 
Especially considering he's frequently shown to be acting in very clo se contact with the standing 
president, despite not being in a position requiring any hearing/approval/election to be there.

areas, the tech is flat out wrong so often that its not even worthwhile to use. I can't even use Google 
anymore, because the AI summaries it spits out are genuinely incoherent more than half the time.

places money like this could, and should, g o to. Wasting time on this technology can't come close 
to helping us if its doing more damage than it could ever help fix.
