General Comment
DO NOT allow OpenAI or ANY OTHER com pany touting AI learning the ability to steal from  hardworking HUMAN creators. No
entity should have the power to ignore copyright or tradem ark to freely steal from  any Am erican, or any other hum an being the world
over. GenAI is a wasteful, destructive, invasive, and above all UNWANTED industry. It regularly m akes headlines about how little, if any,
benefit or profit it creates for com panies that institute it. It steals jobs from  real people to replace them  with a com puter that is
INCAPABLE of actually thinking or judging its own output. It's a privacy and security nightm are. How long until these com panies scrape
national secrets from  som eone's com puter sim ply because these AI com panies, and the com panies who utilize AI learning m odels, m ake it
im possible to actually rem ove or disable from  our m achines. 
It steals from  people, it steals their jobs, it violates our privacy, it violates our properties. It requires enorm ous am ounts of energy that
m any grids can't even handle. It replaces trusted system s and services with a DEEPLY inferior or even outright dangerous im itations (think
of the instances of genAI creating fictitious court cases, or AI google searches giving instructions on creating chlorine gas). GenAI and the
com panies that push it as "the future" have yet to prove that their product has any real value, and giving them  untethered access to ALL of
our data, is such an incredibly bad idea that there shouldn't even BE a question about it. SAY NO TO GENAI COMPANIES. THEY
CAN NOT HAVE MY WORK. THEY CAN NOT AND WILL NOT STEAL, REPLICATE, OR REPLACE THE TALENT AND
KNOWLEDGE OF MYSELF, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, OR THE REST OF HUMANITY.
NO TO GENAI
