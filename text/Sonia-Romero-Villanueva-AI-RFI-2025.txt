Promote reducing energy consumption and 
increasing efficiency as one of the top priority 
policy measures that should be included in the new 
AI Action Plan. Data centers should mitigate carbon 
emissions associated with AI energy consumption 
by transitioning  to renewable energy sources, such 
as solar or wind, and adopting energy efficiency 
practices. AI must have net zero emissions to keep 
pace with international climate goals.
