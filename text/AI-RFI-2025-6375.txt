General Comment
I absolutely disagree with this disaster of a plan. As proposed it would be a m assive violation of copyright, allowing AI to steal from  the
livelihoods of Am ericans such as m yself and profit off of that theft. Copyright law exists for a reason. I do not believe AI should get a free
pass to ignore those laws in this country or any other.
