Reese Theobald,  
My name is Reese Theobald and I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth 
High S chool. I completed a semester course on AI and Ethics and studied the impacts of 
Generative AI on the legislative process. E.O. 14179 will potentially bring about a disruption to much of current attempts to regulate AI development at the state level. I believe that policy about regulation and governance should be based on many of the bills already passed at the state level. States such as Alabama and Colorado have already passed a variety of bills to ensure child safety and prevent ad misinformation and deep fakes. We cannot censor misinformation or deep fakes, but we can provide resources for citizens to be more informed and aware of what a deep fake might look li ke, or the signs that deep fakes tend to have. As a citizen who is soon to be an 
eligible voter and uses social media almost daily, the prevalence of deep fakes and AI misinformation is more real than we can even imagine, and I encounter it on a daily basis. While I have personally educated myself on how to recognize these forms of media, not every person in this nation has, and in order for us to vote effectively we cannot be misled by prompts given to AI from someone living in their parentâ€™s basement.
