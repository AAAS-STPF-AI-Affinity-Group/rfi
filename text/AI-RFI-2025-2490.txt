General Comment
As a creative m yself, I absolutely disagree with allowing AI to just be able to bypass copyright to learn off of anything. People who have
that creativity are greatly im pacted by the recent rise of AI. Because what we have spent our lives learning to do and create what we're
passionate about, can be soulless recreated at the push of a button. And then what are we to do? Just twiddle our thum bs and accept
obsolescence? No. We stand to fight against it. To fight against our creations being taken without our consent, so that a learning algorithm
can try and again to m ake a hand with the proper am ount of fingers. So that it can learn to replace us. If you don't want labor workers
being "replaced" then why are the creative any different? We deserve to have our work treated just the sam e. Do not pass this plan.
