General Comment
The incessant widespread adoption is the epitom e of everything wrong with m odern tech. Where will AI be in 5 years, when the m ajority
of its training data it's scraping will be other AI-generated works? And m oreover, how exactly does this im prove Am erican culture?
Artists are already struggling to be seen, flooded by a thousand hastily m ade AI prom pts for every single artwork. Som ething I've noticed
with every AI advocate is that it "dem ocratises art." On paper, it m akes sense, but in practice it's blatantly wrong. Anyone is able to pick
up a pencil and draw or write, and it's the idea that art has to be "good," an already subjective descriptor, to be worth som ething is
honestly sickening. Allowing this plan to pass will be the death of the Am erican arts; it com m oditizes art, seeing it as nothing m ore than a
product, rather than the parts of its sum .
