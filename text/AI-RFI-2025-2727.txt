General Comment
I am  writing this com m ent to m ake it clear I oppose any agreem ent which takes away the legal copyright protections and gives intellectual
property over to artificial intelligence com panies without any com pensation to The Entity or the Creator of the property. This is a terrible
policy that will not only ruin the expertise and professionalism  the United States is known for, it will allow the legal looting of property in
which these com panies have no legal right to as it stands today. Artificial intelligence is a dead end in the form at currently in place. The
com panies and individuals financing, pushing, and generally trying to encroach their Technologies on the people in Mass are doing so in
bad faith. They should have to com pensate in order to use m aterial. Whether it be written, illustrative, or any other m edium . And that
com pensation should be at a level com m iserate with the value of the work. Mark m y words, passage of this regulation would be an
incredible slippery slope that will only lead to the downfall of the United States and its dom inance in the world and business, art, and m any
other industries. I oppose this in full term s.
