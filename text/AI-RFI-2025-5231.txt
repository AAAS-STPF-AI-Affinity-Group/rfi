General Comment
The United States has far larger issues than “AI dom inance”. Attem pting to focus on such a pathetic and useless endeavor is a kick in the
teeth to every Am erican. So m any go without housing, food and education- and yet the US wants to focus on a technological pursuit that
will destroy creative industries and disrupt the lives of its people. Choosing to focus on AI is the worst choice the United States could
m ake.
Generative AI is m assively flawed. It’s built entirely on the theft of pre-existing and hum an-m ade m edia. It produces nothing of value and
poisons inform ational sources. It creates doubt in a person’s m ind about what is actually real. The inform ation it puts out is largely
incorrect and scrapes away at the internet with zero regard for accuracy. It will do nothing but decrease the value and effectiveness of
education. This will, now and in tim e, underm ine the entire structure of our society. 
Stop AI. Stop the Action Plan. Focus on the people of this country.
