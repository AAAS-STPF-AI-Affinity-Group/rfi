General Comment
The hardware and infrastructure costs alone ensure that LLMs can not be truly profitable. They are dem onstrably worse and m ore
expensive than the "problem s" they claim  to solve, and quite frankly, their proponents are only trying to find som eone else to leave holding
the bag.
LLMs/"AI" are m ost definitely not worth giving unrestricted access to copyrighted m aterial to "train" on. It won't even lower costs, as
m ore "training" m eans m ore expensive hardware is required, which m eans m ore energy use and overall waste. Any m aterial produced by
an LLM will also be unable to receive copyright protections in other large m arkets, further lim iting its m oney-m aking potential. 
Please, do not weaken copyright protections in the nam e of this get-rich-quick schem e. If for no other reason than that everyone who
could conceivably have gotten rich quick from  "AI" has already done it.
