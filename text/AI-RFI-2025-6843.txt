General Comment
In the past few years, I have watched m y students' m otivation to develop their own thinking and writing skills plum m et. While they
continue to develop m ore original ideas than AI with prom pting, they have m uch less resilience to try to exercise those m ental m uscles,
because why should they try? I am  terrified that we are decim ating an entire generation of the hum an race. Even if generative AI was
producing superior or original content that had real benefits, the cost to our children is m uch too high. Perhaps this will pay off for
investors, but Am ericans will suffer both in the short and long term .
Also, as a scholar, writer, and visual artist, I do not grant Open AI or any other organization the right to use m y intellectual property
without fair com pensation. Creators need to be paid for their work. If com pensating writers and visual artists and m usicians and anim ators
for their work is too expensive for Sam  Altm an, then AI technology is too expensive for Sam  Altm an.
