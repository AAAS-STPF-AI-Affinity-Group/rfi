General Comment
AI is attem pting to replace artists, m usicians, writers, etc. To m ake it cheaper for already rich com panies to produce second rate
products.
Your action plan should include provisions that prevent com panies from  sneaking in agreem ents to train AI on things the public posts, to
prevent AI com panies from  training AI on publically posted but otherwise copyrighted m aterial not belonging to them , and should include
the ability to sue the com panies should it be discovered they did in fact train their AI on copyrighted works.
