General Comment
DO NOT DO THIS! ai actively steals from  artists, writers, and creators without perm ission to form ulate their algorithm s. This being
signed would m ean no artists would be safe from  copyright infringem ent and copyright violations, and all lawsuits would be null. Creators
need their copyright protection to m ake a living, so i again reiterate, DO NOT DO THIS
