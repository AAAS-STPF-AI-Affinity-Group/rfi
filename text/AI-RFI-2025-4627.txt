General Comment
I do not think AI belongs in our lives. AI has the power to com pletely strip society from  artistic freedom . Generative AI can still peopleâ€™s
voices and creations and use it as its own. AI needs m ore regulation and we cannot let it seep into our creativity. Do not let openAI have
access to copy written work. We m ust protect ourselves.
