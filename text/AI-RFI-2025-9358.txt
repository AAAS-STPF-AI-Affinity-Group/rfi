General Comment
We are at a critical juncture in the developm ent of big data AI in which we m ay choose how its im plem entation will im pact the rest of
society. I believe that now is the tim e to set a clear precedent that m odels which are built from  copyrighted work m ay only operate legally
with the explicitly granted perm ission or license of the copyright holders, particularly in areas where the potential applicability of generative
m odels have the capacity to negatively im pact the copyright owners through m arket com petition.
We should im m ediately act to regulate m odels in such a way that their source data is clearly identified and categorized as private, public
dom ain, or other. It m ay be worthwhile to explore a stautory license m odel sim ilar to the m usic industry.
In addition, regulation is desperately needed to clearly label and identify generative AI products, not only to inform  consum er choices, but
also to assist in preventing situations where m odels are trained on the generated product of prior m odels, which can lead to instability.
