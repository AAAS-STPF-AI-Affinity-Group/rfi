General Comment
We desperately need to keep following the laws we have in place already. I don’t trust this adm inistration to do so, but as an artist I
*have* to com m ent on this.
These tech com panies just realise that they can’t keep up their content theft if they can’t break copyright laws. We shouldn’t just break
those laws in response and allow them  to use that m aterial when other people get in trouble for even just posting clips of snippets of the
sam e m aterial. Doing this without the input of people who create things is also such an awful thing because it would greatly invalidate
anyone who is in the arts.
