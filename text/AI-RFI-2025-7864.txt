AI can't &^% think. compan ies can't &^% MAKE AI or LLMs without training them on bodies of stolen conten t. that's not a 
workabl e business model. I'm a writer and I've spent thousan ds of hours thinking, creati ng, making work, al l for some &^% at 
openAI to be like. hey I didn't pay for this but I own it and I'm gonna feed it to my AI and my AI is gonna &^% out someth ing that's 
not even  recog nizable as human speech . are you &^% kidding me. go to hell with this bull&^%.
