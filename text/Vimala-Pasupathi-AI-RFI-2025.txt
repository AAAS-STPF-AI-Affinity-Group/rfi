AI innovation and US AI Domination are not goals that exceed the health and safety of human 
beings. So far those phrases have meant stealing the work of American workers, including 
writers and artists. Regulations should exist to protect intellectual prope rty and companies from 
engaging in unscrupulous, unethical behaviors. The environment is also impacted negatively 
from a lack of regulation, so regulation that understands the resource demands of AI is crucial 
for the health of the planet. We shouldn't los e water because somebody wants to use ChatGPT 
instead of a regular web search to do something they could do on their own without AI or 
without electricity even. Books exist still. We the American public are getting AI forced on us, 
not out of market intere sts and need, but out of power and influence, the false need of bailing out 
companies and CEOs who have lost venture capital on these programs. The least the government 
could do is acknowledge that these tech companies are subject to it and shouldn't be al lowed to 
operate without checks that ensure safety for people. real intelligence.
