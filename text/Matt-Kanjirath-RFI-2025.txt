With the use of Artificial Intelligence, we can focus on using technology to understand and 
customize learning to an individual’s needs through the clicks and responses made by each 
student. We could determine if the student is color blind, autistic, left brain, or right brain  and 
customize the curriculum to the student's needs .  I recommend  that the classroom teacher be 
made the business owner of the class , use the laptop to understand the child, and provide human 
interaction where necessary. The curriculum can be loaded onto the laptop from the cloud  and 
modified by an authorized central authority, creating an environment for standardized learning. 
The recommended approach will reduc e the education hierarchy's bureaucracy, which places the 
teacher and staff at the bottom of the decision tree in student education.  
The current US education system emphasizes standardizing testing for all students, forcing 
teachers to “teach to the test,” which limits creativity and flexibility in lesson planning. 
Therefore, teachers are forced to teach to the test, creating an environment of stan dardization that 
does not encourage diverse learning styles of special needs and gifted students in the classroom.  
Public schools, especially in low -income areas, suffer from insufficient funding, outdated 
materials, and large class sizes. Teachers assigned to large class sizes have high administrative 
burdens and excessive paperwork, which results in undue stress. Soc ioeconomic factors, such as 
food insecurity and unstable home environments, impact student performance and cannot  
adequately addressed by schools.  Schools often prioritize academic subjects over essential life 
skills like financial literacy, mental health,  and vocational training. High college tuition costs 
create obstacles for many students pursuing higher education.  
The contemporary United States education system significantly emphasizes  standardized testing 
for all students, compelling educators to focus primarily on test preparation. This approach 
restricts creativity and flexibility in lesson planning, ultimately hindering the ability to 
accommodate diverse learning styles, particularl y for special needs and gifted students.  
Public schools, particularly those in low -income areas, face challenges such as inadequate 
funding, outdated resources, and large class sizes. Educators managing large classrooms 
encounter substantial administrative burdens and excessive paperwork, leading  to increased 
stress levels. Socioeconomic factors, including food insecurity and unstable home environments, 
adversely affect student performance and are often inadequately addressed by educational 
institutions. Furthermore, schools frequently prioritize academic subjects at the expense of 
essential life skills, such as financial literacy, mental health awareness, and vocational training .  
The rising college tuition costs  present additional barriers for many students seeking higher 
education.

Teachers need to be provided with the autonomy and flexibility to tailor their teaching using 
Artificial Intelligence to understand and meet the specific needs of their students. Within a broad 
framework, they could achieve more effective educational outcomes. The hierarchical structure 
within educational institutions places teachers and staff at the lowest tier of decision -making 
authority. We first need to understan d that a class teacher is like the business owner of the class, 
and given the independence and freedom to teach according to needs with a broad guideline, they 
could apply to get the end result. The current hierarchy positions place the teachers and staff at 
the lowest decision -making ladder.  
 
 
 Recommendation  
To empower educators and school staff, delegating the responsibility and authority for 
implementing teaching standards to Artificial Intelligence (AI) is essential . AI possesses the 
transformative potential to enhance student learning by personalizing educational experiences, 
increasing engagement, and optimizing administrative processes. One of AI's most significant 
advantages is its capacity to customize learning experiences based on individual student needs. 
AI can assess students' strengths and weakness es through adaptive learning platforms , offering

personalized approach facilitates a deeper comprehension of complex concepts.  
A good AI -augmented learning model for school -going children should balance personalization, 
engagement, social interaction, and teacher involvement. Below is a n example of a  structured 
approach that integrates AI while maintaining essential human guidance . 
Hybrid Learning Model (AI + Human Teachers)  
The best approach is a blended learning model, in which AI personalizes lessons while  teachers 
provide supervision, emotional support, and deeper engagement.  Key Components:  
 
1. Personalized Learning Paths (AI -driven) 
AI adapts content based on individual  student’s strengths, weaknesses, and learning pace.  
2. Interactive & Gamified Learning (Engagement)  
- AI-powered games, quizzes, and simulations make learning fun and improve 
retention.  
- Example:  AI -based coding games like CodeCombat.  
3. Collaborative AI -Assisted Group Learning  
- AI facilitates peer learning by grouping students based on skill levels and interests.  
- Virtual AI mentors guide group projects, discussion forums, or debates.  
4. Real-time Feedback & Assessment  
- AI tracks student progress and provides instant feedback on mistakes.  
- Teachers receive detailed reports on student performance, allowing targeted 
intervention.  
5. Adaptive AI Tutors & Chatbots  
- AI-powered tutors answer student queries in real-time, reducing their dependency  on 
teachers for routine questions.  
- Example: Google’s Read Along AI helps children with reading fluency.  
6. AI-Powered Creativity Tools  
- AI tools assist in storytelling, art, and music, encouraging creativity.  
- Example: DALL·E or AI -powered storytelling apps generate interactive narratives 
based on prompts.  
7. Ethical & Safe AI Use  
- AI models must be bias-free, explainable, and privacy -compliant to protect children.  
- Schools should ensure data is securely managed and parents have transparency in AI 
decision-making. 
 
A voice response system can be an alternative to chatbots or other technologies for students with 
disabilities , ensuring that assistance is readily available for those in need.  
AI can support educators by automating administrative tasks such as grading and attendance 
tracking. This automation allows teachers to concentrate more on instruction and student 
interaction, ultimately enhancing the quality of education. AI can also anal yze data to identify

curriculum adjustments and intervention strategies.  
Implementation  
With the advancements in cloud technology and data center connectivity, establishing a 
centralized system to develop curricula for each grade is feasible. Assigned administrators and 
classroom teachers can make recommendations for approval, ensuring alignm ent with standards 
set by a central authority. This initiative will streamline existing bureaucratic processes and allow 
for customization tailored to each grade level. Additionally, an AI tool should be developed to 
assess each student's learning style —whether it be right -brain, left -brain, graphic representation, 
or color adjustments for those who are color blind —while providing detailed examples in 
specific lessons as needed.  
Summary  
In summary, AI has the potential to revolutionize student learning in schools by personalizing 
education, enhancing engagement, and supporting educators . This would ultimately lead  to a 
more effective and enriching educational experience for all students.
