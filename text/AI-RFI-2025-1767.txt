AILiteracy response to Ostp Nsf Rfi notice request

Subject: Response to RFI on the Development of an AI Action Plan  
March 14, 2025  
Introduction: AI Literacy as a Pillar for Global AI Leadership  
The AI Literacy Foundation appreciates the opportunity to provide input on the development of an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. As the United States charts its course toward maintaining 
AI leadership, it is crucial to recognize that AI literacy , both domestically and globally , plays a 
fundamental role in ensuring democratic AI adoption, economic growth, and national security.  
While much of the current AI discourse has focused on export controls and strategic competition, 
history has shown that true leadership is not solely about restriction but also about strategic 
engagement, capacity building, and fostering inclusive AI adopt ion globally. The Global South, 
home to over 60% of the world’s youth population, presents an opportunity for U.S. AI leadership, 
economic expansion, and democratic influence.  
We submit this memo to urge the integration of AI literacy initiatives, global AI engagement, and 
structured AI cooperation with the Global South as part of the U.S. AI Action Plan  as this  is also  


2 important to avoid leaving it out to other players such as  China to dominate it due to  US restrictive 
policies . 
A Case for AI Literacy  
1.It is important for the plan to  recognize AI literacy as a strategic national asset, much like
STEM education was during the Space Race. If the U.S. is to lead AI innovation and
governance globally, it must ensure that AI is understood, trusted, and accessible , both
within its borders and in emerging AI markets such as Africa, Latin America, and Southeast
Asia.  A digitally literate and AI -informed global workforce will shape AI adoption trends.
Countries that lack AI education and literacy will default to A I models built by nations that
actively engage them , potentially tilting AI influence toward authoritarian regimes.
2.Failure to engage the Global South in AI capacity -building risks ceding ground to China.
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has extended China’s technological reach into Africa,
Latin America, and parts of Europe. The U.S. must not allow the same to happen  in AI. A
US-centered AI-literate in the Global South ensures the preference for democratic AI
principles, open innovation, and U.S. -aligned AI ecosystems.
3.AI misinformation, cybersecurity threats, and deepfake manipulation pose growing risks
to democratic societies. Equipping citizens , both in the U.S. and allied nations , with AI
literacy enhances resilience against AI -enabled disinformation and ensures alignment with
U.S. security interests.
A robust AI literacy framework helps mitigate AI skill gaps that could lead to reliance on 
foreign AI systems for critical infrastructure. By investing in AI literacy, the U.S. fortifies its 
workforce and reduces reliance on adversarial AI models.  


3 The Role of the Global South in U.S. AI Leadership  
1.AI literacy presents an unparalleled opportunity for the U.S. to exert soft power, countering
China’s AI expansionism through educational partnerships, technology exchange
programs, and AI research hubs. By integrating AI training programs, scholarships, a nd AI
capacity -building initiatives into foreign policy efforts, the U.S. can cement its AI
leadership for generations.
2.The Global  South is not only a consumer market for AI but a future contributor to AI
innovation, particularly in areas such as  agriculture, health tech, and financial inclusion.
This offers an early opportunity for U.S. AI partnership driven by a private -public  sector
to be  actively incorporate d into the Global South as an AI collaborator rather than an
afterthought.  Africa, home to the world’s fastest -growing youth population, is poised to be
a global AI powerhouse if investments in AI education and litera cy are prioritized.
Engagement today means influence for US tomorrow .
Recommended Polic ies for the AI Action Plan  
1.The Plan needs to e stablish a National AI Literacy Framework to integrate AI education at
all levels  - from K -12 to workforce reskilling programs.
2.Partner with US-based universities, industry leaders, and research institutions to develop
US centric AI literacy programs for non -technical stakeholders, including policymakers,
journalists, and business leaders  in Global South .
3.Launch Global AI Literacy Initiative s targeting the Global South to counteract China’s AI
dominance and promote ethical AI adoption aligned with U.S. values.
4.Establish AI knowledge -sharing partnerships with governments, universities, and tech hubs
across Africa, Latin America, and Asia.  Also, i ncentivize U.S. AI firms to provide AI


4 training, internships, and AI -based entrepreneurship support to emerging markets, ensuring 
democratic AI adoption . 
5.Integrate AI literacy into national security strategy to combat deepfake misinformation,
cyber threats, and algorithmic manipulation.
6.Mandate AI awareness and risk education for public officials, election bodies, and perhaps
media organizations to safeguard democratic institutions.
7.Expand visa and research exchange programs for AI scholars from the Global South,
strengthening U.S. academic AI dominance.  Establish a Global AI Training Fund,
providing AI skills development for underrepresented communities and ensuring AI
innovation reflects diverse perspectives.
Conclusion: A Future -Proofed AI Strategy for the U.S.  
The U.S. must recognize that AI leadership is not just about developing the best models or 
regulations that ban models or platforms, but ensuring the world understands, trusts, and aligns 
with them. AI literacy, both at home and abroad, is not an optional add -on, it is a foundational 
pillar for sustaining U.S. economic, technological, and geopolitical leadership . We urge the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy to integrate AI literacy initiatives and strategic AI engagement 
with the Global South into th e AI Action Plan.
