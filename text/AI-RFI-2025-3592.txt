General Comment
AI had no positive place in hum anities future. It's taken Am erican jobs, m y own included. The art or writing it produces is soulless and
causes nothing but needless problem s in the workforces its being used in. A future with AI is not one I would wish on anyone. Can't
believe its even m ade it this far in grained into society as is. What are we even doing? This has got to stop.
