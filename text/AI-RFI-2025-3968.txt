General Comment
AI com panies should not be allow to ignore copyright in order to m ake their m odels. This isn't an "unnecessary, burdensom e" regulation, it
is a vital (and Constitutionally-m andated) part of Am erican society. Let private enterprise pay for the resources they want to m ake use of,
just like everyone else.
