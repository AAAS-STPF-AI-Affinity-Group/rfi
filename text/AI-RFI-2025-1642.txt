Hello, 
Please do not change the laws on AI as AI is nothing but a shady practice with no real excuse to have any kind of law protecting it. In all
form s, it's becom e an absolute hindrance in both science and creativity. It's not even any kind of true artificial intelligence, it's a learning
program . Please listen to people who have som e sense and do not try to m ake AI the standard for our lives and what is accepted.
