Do we need AI oversight? Yes Why? People are losing jobs and jobs that pay enough for house 
maintenance, groceries for a family of four, utilities, taxes, insurance and medical expenses are 
hard to find. How about government makes it a priority for compani es to create efficient 
humanoids that can help families pay for these costs? How can humanoid generate revenue? A 
government AI trust could pay quarterly dividends to households based on AI productivity, 
provide support to families to own/hire humanoids to  help farming etc
