AI has no reason to do well, be accurate, or improve beyond what prompts
it's fed. Nor can it be held accountable when things go wrong. LettingAI create and letting it be unattended can lead to disastrousconsequences or results.
We already have AI impersonating real people, AI writing hate speech,
and AI already in the market using content from other creators.
AI is a dangerous waste of time and serves no purpose but more trouble.
