General Comment
I am  deeply concerned about the phrase "to ensure that unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents do not ham per private sector AI
innovation". Already we have seen exam ples of AI being used for m aking critical decisions and m aking m istakes where the reasoning
cannot easily be determ ined.
AI should be subject to *significant* regulation and hum an oversight precisely because if an AI m akes a wrong decision, it is im possible to
hold that AI accountable.
While there are plenty of m achine-m ediated decision engines out there, GenAI has the distinction of not only m iscalculation but of
hallucinating incorrect facts or conclusions out of thin air.
