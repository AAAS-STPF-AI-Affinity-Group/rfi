General Comment
As a private citizen of the US, an artist, and a vocalist, I am  not com fortable with private com panies utilizing m y art or voice to train any
AI m odels without m y consent or knowledge. To give coporations the power to disrespect m y agency and the ways in which I m ake
m oney and pay taxes is unlawful, unoriginal, and un-Am erican.
If we truly wanted to care about our "com petition" against China, focus on education instead of trying to gut it and truly work to m ake
Am erica Great by trying to im prove the lives of its citizens instead of the pockets of billionaires.
