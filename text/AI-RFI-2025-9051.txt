General Comment
I don't think com panies developing LLMs and other AI should be allowed to do m assive sweeps of copyrighted m aterial for free and
claim  fair use. They're talking about just having free rein on all the copyrighted m aterial in the world because "it's for training." If your
com pany can't pay for the raw resources, it's not m uch of a com pany at all. Property rights for m e, but not for thee.
