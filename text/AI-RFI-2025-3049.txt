General Comment
As som eone in a creative industry, advancing AI by feeding it copyrighted works freely is a despicable act that would only harm  m y line of
work and livelyhood. I'm  firm ly against allowing anyone or any com pany free rights to take everything I've m ade without m y consent under
the guise of 'advancing AI'.
