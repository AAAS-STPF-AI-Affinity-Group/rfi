General Comment
What these people want to do is im m oral. It will destroy the welfare and future of m illions of artists. Art will becom e the m achine and the
future of our country will be ground into a fine paste under the threads of the Apathy Machine. Designed only to work and consum e until
we die. That is not the life we were m eant to live. Fight back against these m onsters who wish to STEAL our hard work and create
NOTHING with it.
