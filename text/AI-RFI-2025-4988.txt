General Comment
We can absolutely not let AI com panies willfully steal from  anyone and everything just because "AI would be dead in the water without it."
Would we let a com pany m ine in Native land if there was a m ineral there they wanted? Would we let a com pany go into another
com pany's HQ and take their office supplies because "they needed them  to succeed"?
Please do not allow this to go forward.
