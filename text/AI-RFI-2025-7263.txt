General Comment
I think it's bad, actually, to give AI com panies free reign to steal everything they can get their greedy m itts on to use for training data.
That's really all there is to this. It's a terrible idea, subm itted by terrible people, for the purpose of doing a terrible thing. Tell these churls to
get bent and be done with it.
