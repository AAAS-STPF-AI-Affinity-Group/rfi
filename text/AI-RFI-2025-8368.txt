General Comment
Ridiculous that we allowed this technology to be ca lled "AI" when all it does is pred ict what words/s ymbols come next. It's not intelligent. 
It's not even  rel iably accurate. It's a waste of  energ y, water, and ti me. It's the new hot dot-com  bubble. It's bri nging nothing new or 
useful to our species nor to our society. It's overh yped beyond the poi nt of  farce. Real  On ion  s&^%.
