General Comment
Section 2 is too broad. It could deem  the whole of EO 14110 to not be in line with section 2 and revoke it com pletely. This would open
up AI com panies to bypass DMCA, potentially expose PII, and hurt all publishers by allowing them  to claim  that their m odel is
transform ative and constitutes fair use. Allowing them  to m ake m oney off the backs of other people's hard work and creativeness without
proper com pensation.
