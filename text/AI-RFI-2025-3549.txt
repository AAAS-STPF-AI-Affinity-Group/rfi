General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. Allowing the technology to study art without com pensating artists is a violation of
the spirit of our plagiarism  laws and will lead to catastrophic results for artists. Please do not allow technology com panies the ability to
steal from  artists without duly com pensating them .
