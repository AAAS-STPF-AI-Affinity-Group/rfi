General Comment
AI is an obvious scam  that steals work from  people who actually do som ething for a living. The only value it has is in inflating the
valuations of com panies that don't m ake real products in order to benefit venture capitalists. It doesn't deserve any protections of any kind
and should instead be heavily regulated, to the point of having a very narrow set of legal uses.
