General Comment
Absolutely not! Do not gut copyright and give unfettered access to private data, intellectual property, and protected arts. 
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US and is a snake oil technology acting as an "in" for nefarious organizations to profit
off of others' hard work. AI personally steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and directly profits off of theft. It is an unsustainable
m echanism  as it requires theft to function. You are ignorant if you can't see through the deception of AI as a business, it is not viable. 
In order for AI to be ethical, it m ust com pensate creators for copyrighted training data. AI-generated m aterials are not copyrightable.
Furtherm ore, there are not adequate security m echanism s or laws lim iting hum an "replacem ent" with AI. There is no financial or tim e
benefit to replacing hum an workers with AI as the output of AI has never proven itself m ore valuable, m ore accurate, or of higher quality
than hum an-m ade work.
Furtherm ore, the ecological im pact of training AI as it currently stands consum es ludicrous am ounts of resources. Whether in the form  of
energy, freshwater for cooling, or the m anpower required to clean up the subpar output, AI is a m assive net-loss.
