General Comment
AI hurts the job m arket (and as a designer, is hurting m y livelihood by decreasing dem and), dilutes the truth, and wastes precious
resources on energy. I do not think AI has a place in the world. We need to protect people's copyright and livelihood. AI being trained on
people's artworks and photos without express perm ission from  their creators/owners is theft.
