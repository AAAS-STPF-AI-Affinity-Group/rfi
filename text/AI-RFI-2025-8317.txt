General Comment
Generative AI such as OpenAI provide absolutely no scientific benefit to anyone. It does nothing but take previous inform ation(Im ages,
writing, anim ation, etc.) given to it, shred it into pieces and then rem ix the pieces in a way it thinks looks correct. It cannot com e to its one
conclusions, or create anything new - and therefore it is m ore useless than a toddler.
