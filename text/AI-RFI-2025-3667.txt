General Comment
The United States of Am erica’s AI action plan should revolve around protecting United States citizens from  the destruction that unfettered
AI can havoc. Ideally, legislation would be drafted and approved to lim it AI datasets used for training, lim it the output of AI program s,
and appropriately fund ethical uses of AI for the public good. The ideal scenarios include using AI to detect life threatening diseases, such
as cancer, earlier and with m ore accuracy, and using AI to process large am ounts of data m ore effectively than hum ans can. The US
governm ent both shouldn’t be concerned with using and be actively lim iting AI that com m its potential copyright infringem ent from  training
its m odels on products of hum an creation, such as art pieces, YouTube videos, and scripts from  television/m ovies. AI that aim s to create
m edia for consum ption that is norm ally m ade by hum ans is an even m ore effective waste of tim e than the pieces of m edia them selves.
Rather, the US governm ent should concern them selves with legislation and enforcem ent of legislation that protects citizens jobs from  AI
copyright infringem ent and keeps hum ans creating m edia that is m eant to console and touch other hum ans.
