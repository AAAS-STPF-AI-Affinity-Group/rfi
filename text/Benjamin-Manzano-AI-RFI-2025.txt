Hello and good morning. I just want to say that I believe that food production and the  
elimination of hunger in America should be of the highest priority with the AI Action Plan.
Simply put, if we utilize AI to produce a food surplus in our country, food prices would drop 
dramatically, and also millions of Americans would be able to afford groceries directly from 
their own money instead of relying on EBT.
This would align with the President’s “Make America Healthy Again” initiative by utilizing  
AI to provide real and transparent data about why they are so unhealthy.
 This, of course, would mean taking on the fast food and candy industries that are at the nexus  
of the health epidemic in our country. There’s far too much sugar and oil in the food products  
we are eating. We also need more in depth food nutrition facts displayed on the label…often  
times the most plentiful Vitamin of a food product isn’t even listed on the nutrition facts.
Just as the President and his Administration have been blasting the instances of fraud and  
abuse as they discover them, the same loud and vocal blasting of unhealthy food and  
restaurants needs to happen.
Lastly, a limit on the amount of sugar that is allowed per gram or liquid ounce of a food  
product would improve the individual health of American citizens because sugar wrecks the  
human immune system.
