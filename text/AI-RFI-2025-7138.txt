General Comment
We need strong legal protections for original creators from  which AI will scrape m aterial. AI is often just plagiarism  of art, it is ugly and
uninspiring, and I donâ€™t want to live in a world where art and language are defaulted to being created by com puters. Save the idea of
original art from  the degradation by sim plicity, speed, and boring efficiency of AI. Please consider the uses of AI and the need for original
ideas to thrive.
