General Comment
AI needs to be restricted m ore than m ost industries, due to the potential for abuse. Applying copyright laws m ore strictly to AI usage
would be a reasonable response. Being im m une to copyright law will be exploited by organizations having nothing to do with the intended
goal of this proposal.
