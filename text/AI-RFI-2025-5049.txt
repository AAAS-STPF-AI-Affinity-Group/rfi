General Comment
Generative AI devalues art, AI is a telem etry system  that m ishm ashes art created by hum ans to spit out som ething stolen by true creators. 
It can never encapsulate true creativity, it can never encapsulate the wonder of the hum an im agination.
Keep AI away from  am y art, it will only destroy products m ade by true hum an beings.
