General Comment
The U.S. governm ent should do everything it can to restrict and regulate com paniesâ€™ ability to steal from  the hard work that creative
people do. The hard work that earns them  a living and gives them  an opportunity to live up in the world, what the Am erican experience is
supposed to be all about. AI can only learn and prosper by stealing the intellectual property of real hum an beings: please support real
hum an beings over faces less com panies and AI software.
