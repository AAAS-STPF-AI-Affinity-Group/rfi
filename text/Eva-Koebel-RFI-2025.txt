Hello. I'm a graduating senior from Pittsburgh, PA. For a semester -long English course, I 
researched the impact of generative AI on mental health, and we recently studied the 
administration's viewpoint on AI regulation. Based on the months of research I co nducted, I 
think that is detrimental to current mental healthcare systems. AI algorithms have immense 
biases and often discriminate based on these biases. This leads to unequal treatment that could 
potentially harm patients rather than assist them. I also found that AI could undermine the 
benefits of person -to-person care that comes with the medical field. From an ethical perspective, 
this raises the concern of human autonomy. If we are to begin relying on robots to conduct 
assessments or act as therapists,  there is a large disconnect. More regulation needs to be put in 
place to limit the usage of AI in certain fields. Keeping it away from patient -doctor interactions 
is crucial to prevent these concerns from prospering. Thank you for your time and for hearin g my 
concerns/opinions!
