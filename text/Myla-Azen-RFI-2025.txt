My name is Myla Azen, and I am a graduating senior from Avonworth High School. I researched 
the impact of generative AI on religious persecution for a semester course and recently studied 
this administration's viewpoint on AI regulation. Based on two month s of student research, I 
think regulation and preventative laws are essential to ensure that artificial intelligence flourishes 
beneficially. With AI quickly advancing globally, religious groups across the nation are 
increasingly vulnerable to the potentia l misuse of AI. Specifically, the Uyghur Muslim 
population in China has been targeted under "anti -terrorism" sentiments. AI -powered 
surveillance and policing tactics have been utilized to suppress religious groups and violate 
human rights. Preventative mea sures must be put in place to reduce the risks of AI being 
weaponized against vulnerable populations. I believe such regulations can protect not only 
religious freedoms but also the fundamental rights of all individuals.
