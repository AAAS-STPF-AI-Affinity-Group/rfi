General Comment
We need to ensure that ai software does not take the place of hum an decision . m akers and established constitutional processes. AI have
no m oral or ethical constraints and could be program m ed to act so as to cause harm  to actual persons. Liability for such an eventuality
could require resolution through lengthy court processes at im m ense cost to taxpayers. AI m ust be carefully cultivated by independent,
ethical contractors with careful oversight by an accountable com m ittee with authority to stop, delay, edit, and/or cancel those parts of the
program  set that m ay fail to m eet legal and ethical standards. Isaac Asim ov sought to identify and explore som e of these issues with his
series of stories com piled as I, Robot, et seq. We have an opportunity to consider such a path but m ust concurrently plan for vast
econom ic upheaval our current sociopolitical system  is unequipped to m anage.
