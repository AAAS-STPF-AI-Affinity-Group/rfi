General Comment
AI as it currently exists and as it is being explored by for-profit entities is inherently flawed, unreliable, and unsafe. AI language/chat
functions require and rely on stolen data AND use that data to produce inaccurate results, m isleading sum m aries, and flawed or sim ply
im aginary source citations. 
Do NOT fund, enable, or legally support access; do NOT use as public interface!
