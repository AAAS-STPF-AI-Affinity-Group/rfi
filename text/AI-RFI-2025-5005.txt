General Comment
AI holds no place in the future of Am erica or in the world at large. AI steals the livelihood of hard working Am ericans and prevents them
from  achieving the Am erican dream ! AI is overhyped and already out the door, and allowing it a place at the table would m ean Am erica
goes out the door, too.
