General Comment
Please keep th is absol ute thieving garbage out of ex istence. If I'm forced to choke down garbage AI &^% for one more day I 
swear to  god I'm gonna lose it. NOBODY WANTS "AI" ESPECIA LLY THAT DOESN'T EVEN WORK PROPE RLY IN THE 
FIRST  PLACE, THAT'S TRAINED ON STOL EN WORKS FROM ACTUAL HUMAN CR EATORS. STOP TRYING TO 
SOLVE PROB LEMS THAT DON'T EXIST.
