General Comment
Unrestrained AI training on the creations of artists severely underm ines the effort artists put into their livelihoods and dem onstrates a gross
irreverence to copyright law.
Keep your grubby capitalist hands out of the creativity artists pour their blood, sweat, and tears into to keep the lights on and express
them selves. If you want a piece of the pie, pick up a goddam n pencil and start learning how to create instead of steal.
