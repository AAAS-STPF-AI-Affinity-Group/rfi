Thanks for allowing me to input.
I am concerned with AI.  While we may want to have the best technology, I am afraid this will  
come at a cost in the lives of Americans.
I once heard Elon Musk say lots of people may well sit back and be able to retire early ... and  
enjoy life.  He said on the heels of that comment he said absolutely, he would continue to  
work !!!
I am a Pastor and RN.  My concern is as you take meaningful labor away from people,  
whatever their jobs are, you may well also take away their meaning in life ... to do their life's  
work, support a family, find joy in what they do.  I believe as you create this scenario, you are  
setting many people up for mental health issues due to lots of free time, while taking away  
meaning and the drive to work and be useful.
AI, at the least, needs to be controlled so the machines don't become out of control with their  
knowledge - this could also cause major chaos, especially if it gets into the wrong hands (eg.  
USA 2020-2024 with Biden and Obama in the basement or if used by China to manipulate  
other countries ... including ours !!!).
Thanks for letting me voice my opinion !!!
