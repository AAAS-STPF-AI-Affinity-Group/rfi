To whom it may concern:
My name is CJ Bernstein-Feld. I am 39 years old and a lifelong, legal citizen of the United
States. I have spent a lot of my life on the internet, admiring and appreciating the works ofcountless artists
 and writers, both professional and amateur. I myself am an amateur writer
with dreams of someday publishing a novel.
In recent years it has come to my attention that AI learning models have been scraping
copyrighted works from some of those very same artists and writers I have admired online.These communities have expressed their displeasure at having their intellectual property stolenwithout their permission and without any recompense.
I do not support OpenAI and I do not support their infringement
 on artists, writers, and other
creatives. OpenAI should be held to the same standards and copyright laws as anyone else--
theft is theft.
