General Comment
Artificial Intelligence m ust be regulated to prevent infringem ent on the copyrighted m aterial of independent creatives and businesses. If it is
not, those skillsets will dim inish from  the public eye and eventually AI will begin to train off it's own data, som ething which has been shown
to drastically worsen the quality of its results. You will find yourself in a world where AI doesn't function effectively and a world where the
skills that you intend AI to replace have been alienated by your actions and consider your business and your projects to be poison.
