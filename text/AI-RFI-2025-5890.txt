General Comment
Not only is it too early in AI technology's cultural adoption to give AI training unrestricted access to all data, but I think its reasonable for
authors and artists to be com pensated for their work.
Also, one should recognize that an AI trained on Disney m ovies (or even just one Disney m ovie) could reproduce those m ovies (or
m ovie). In fact it would be fairly easy to train an AI to reproduce any particular copyrighted work, so this legislation would essentially
m ake copyrights invalid.
