General Comment
why the f&^% does an industry that has only proved it's good for LOSING MONEY get to flout copyri ght like this is the 
stupidest s&^% ever. Literally the only peopl e who care about 'AI dominance' are the peopl e hawking it, no one else wants 
this *at al l*. There's absol utely zero reason why AI compan ies should be exem pt from copyri ght persecuti on in this current  
environment, and honestly any focus spent here is a godda mn waste of resou rces am ou nting to *anoth er* payou t to useless 
capital ists.
