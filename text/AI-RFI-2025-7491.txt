General Comment
AI is theft. The developer OpenAI has said it would be im possible to create tools like ChatGPT without access to copyrighted m aterial,
and it's accessing that m aterial without perm ission. This is theft.
Multiple courts have said that AI generated works cannot be copyrighted. 
AI is costing people jobs. I haven't worked in a year because jobs for writers are disappearing due to the use of AI. I want a governm ent
that creates jobs for its citizens. Tech industry layoffs are widespread. This is all the fault of AI. 
No im m igrant has ever taken a job from  m e, but AI has taken m y job. Ban generative AI.
