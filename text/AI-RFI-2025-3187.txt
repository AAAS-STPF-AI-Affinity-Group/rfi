General Comment
What is the point in creating art if com panies can steal your work, run it through a m achine, and profit, while you get nothing? Copyright
protections exist to protect original ideas. Generative AI works are not original by definition. I also can't see large IP holders like Disney,
which em ploy large swathes of people, taking the unauthorized use of their IP lying down. Protecting AI com panies from  the
consequences of their actions is not the business of governm ent. 
On a personal note, I'm  a teacher. How can I realistically m ake the case that students should think creatively if their creativity will be
stolen by big tech, and they'll receive no benefit?
