General Comment
AI is not the way forward for Am erica. It's already threatened the livelihoods and job security of m illions of Am erican citizens and that's
without the governm ent rem oving guardrails that prevent AI developers from  further overstepping the intellectual rights and property of
hard working Am ericans. AI inherently steals all the data it uses to "train" it's sets and algorithm s, and can only profit by use of theft. 
AI has no place in Am erica's security, job force, or future.
