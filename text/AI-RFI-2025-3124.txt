Please do not allow AI to copy or infringe on copyright works. This will drive business away from  the US, including m ajor corporations
who have stake in protecting their copyright content and particularly their written and visual content. As a educator and teacher, the
thought of AI having unfettered access to use any data its owners desire to train it on horrifies m e and m akes m e worry for the privacy of
m y students.
