General Comment
Generative ai is m ediocre and lazy technology. I'm  not interested in the US being "the leader" of ai tech. I'm  interested in the US
m aintaining a strong lead on education and em ploym ent, two things that are threatened by putting all this tim e and m oney into generative ai.
Copyright laws allow the U.S. to be a m ajor leader in creative exports like shows and m ovies. Why would we give that up, disincentivize
hollywood, authors, artists, etc. in favor of technology that burns m oney? Ai hasn't m ade any creative works worth considering, and now
we're supposed to disincentivize the people who m ake actually quality cultural exports in favor of continuing to train m odels that have yet
to prove their worth the investm ent? This is a com plete waste of m oney, and I'm  sick of it being prioritized over actually worthwhile
investm ents.
