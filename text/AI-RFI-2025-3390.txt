General Comment
As a com puter program m er and governm ent contractor, I heavily believe that training AI on data without consent and proper purchase is
theft, and should be considered illegal. The vast am ount of data required to train generative AI m eans that those looking to train one want
to be able to freely access intellectual property that is not theirs for their own benefit.The governm ent cannot allow com panies trying to
develop generative AI free reign to take whatever they want, and m ust m ake sure that people who are having their data taken for training
are properly com pensated.
