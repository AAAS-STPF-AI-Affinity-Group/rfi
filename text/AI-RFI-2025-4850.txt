General Comment
AI is theft. It cannot produce content without first stealing content from  others, often (alm ost always) without consent. The use of AI in the
arts and hum anities dam ages our culture but m ore im portantly it dam ages the livelihood of our citizens. Individuals should take priority
over corporations looking to m ake a profit. Am erica should not be investing in AI or providing any legal loopholes for this blatant theft.
