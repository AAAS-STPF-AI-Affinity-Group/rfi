General Comment
As a professional artist and educator, the power of AI to use work in the public dom ain as well as m odern artist’s without their
knowledge is incredibly alarm ing. The im ages artists create are their livelihood - this includes their own “artistic style” or how they create
them , the way they look. Any training AI receives from  an artist’s work is essentially taking their individual style for m onetary gain. It
should be illegal through copyright laws. 
I know illustrators whose incom e has been cut m ore in half due to the unauthorized use of their style in training AI, and then selling those
im ages for com m ercial use (in som e cases nearly identical to the artist’s work). This is a huge overstep and infringem ent on artists’s rights. 
AI is a powerful tool that I’m  sure can do som e good, however it is already doing great harm  to the art sector by replacing the work and
livelihoods of hard-workin on Am ericans. Please regulate AI in a way that preserves the im age and creative rights of artists.
