General Comment
"AI" is noy necessary for national security, nor is dom inance in the m arket needed for global power. "AI" as it exists today is vastly
overstated in capabilities and often m isnam ed in an attem pt to m islead people about what it can do. What AI will do is further dam age the
econom y by destroying the livelihoods of countless hardworking Am erican citizens by stealing their work and putting them  unfairly out of
jobs.
It will do nothing but harm  the Am erican people, our sm all business owners who work hard to earn their place in this country.
