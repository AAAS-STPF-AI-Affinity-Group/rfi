This docum ent was also sent to  but I am  also sending it here in case it was sent incorrectly. 
As an artist whose work is stolen in the algorithm  of generative ai, and as a form er teacher, believe that ai should not hold any place in the
united states. At best, it is just an overhyped bubble waiting to be popped, but at its worst, AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican,
profits off of theft, and encourages laziness. Many students squander their education, choosing to m ake chat gpt do their work for them . In
the way that it is currently being used and developed, it does m ore harm  than good to the intelligence of the Am erican people. Please, for
the good of Am erica and its people, do not allow AI to continue in its current form  unregulated.
