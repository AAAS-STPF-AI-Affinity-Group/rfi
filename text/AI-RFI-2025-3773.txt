General Comment
AI that has no guardrails is ripe for abuse. It WILL kill the industry corporations routinely exploit before canabalizing itself--all for the
sake of m aking things "easier". AI has been around for years but all this will do is m ake it m ore difficult for the world to properly find a use
for it. Stealing from  creators will drive down the inability to create, will drive down the willingness to create, and the only people you can
blam e will be yourselves. You all think AI will save us but it will be the death of every art form  that m akes Am erica great--and you will be
responsible for that.
