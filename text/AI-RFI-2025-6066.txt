General Comment
OpenAi and AI as a whole. Should not EVER be allowed to freely tram ple any form  of copywrite.
From  jobs being taken and nothing to replace them , hum an creativity literally being stolen and regurgitated by a m achine -for profit- with
no com pensation to artists or com panies at all, not even a form  of CREDIT where they sourced their m aterials from .
We are talking about taking the whole of the world's im agination, stories, hobbies, and a source of joy being profiteered by one com pany
and if you're okay with that, you better be okay with m yself or any other hum an being on the planet, walking into your hom e and taking
your car, then bringing it back with the wrong tires and spray painted because.
"I didn't STEAL IT i borrowed, took it apart, learned from  it, took the good parts to sell for m y own, and then ""transform ed it"".
Think on that.
