General Comment
The idea that AI com panies need to steal dataâ€”art, writing, our individual com m unication as hum an beings, is such an absurd escalation
of their grift. As an agented writer, as som eone who cares about hum an m ade art, and as som eone who thinks that business should be
about creating good products without asking a whole ass governm ent to intervene on your behalf to let you steal the labor of others, I ask
that you deny these awful com panies this.
