General Comment
As an Am erican citizen I feel that OpenAI is going to do m ore harm  than good. These com panies will blatantly steal copyrighted IPs and
spread false and som etim es actively dangerous m isinform ation to the general public. Those who don't take the tim e to learn the difference
between AI generated content and real hum an output will be m ore at risk to scam s than ever before. Fake AI job listings already m ake
job hunting a nightm are for the average person and this will only exacerbate the issue to the point that any job search function on any
website will becom e unusable. There is no benefit to these AI bots that do things we already can do ourselves, but with technology and
costs that far exceed just sim ply letting a hum an do their job.
