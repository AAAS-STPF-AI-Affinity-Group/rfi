General Comment
AI can be a powerful tool if used correctly, but it should not take the place of hum an creativity, which is what generative AI aim s to do.
In an ideal future, we want AI to do our dishes or our laundry so that we have tim e write and create art even m ore, not the other way
around.
Generative AI is also unethical, I believe. It is trained on im ages without their owners' consent, and can thus em ulate art styles of artists
without their consent either. What it does create, though, lacks any actual creativity. It lacks the passion, the soul, the thoughtfulness that
artists put into their work. It's an insult to artists everywhere, honestly.
The arts are a vital part of society and exem plify what m akes us hum an. They should not be replaced. Generative AI should be regulated if
not outright banned. There should be no loopholes for its developers to exploit. They should focus on AI that is actually beneficial to
society, like that which could help with national defense. Thank you.
