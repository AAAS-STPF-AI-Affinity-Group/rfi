General Comment
I work as a graphic designer. My work already has been greatly im pacted by the theft engine known as generative AI. Rem oving
hum anity from  processes like art and writing will only serve to dehum anize us all. 
I have also worked with AI. Largely, it is unhelpful. It spends vast am ounts of resources to create subpar work m ade by sticking
copyrighted m aterial in a blender. Gen AI does not im prove m y workflow and even using it as a tool in m y overall process leads to a
subpar final product.
We should not allow AI corporations to steal wholesale from  the creative output of the Am erican public. Their intention is only to enrich
them selves by stealing from  the rest of us. 
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States.
