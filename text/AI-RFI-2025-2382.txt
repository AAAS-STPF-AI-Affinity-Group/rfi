General Comment
In no way should "AI" be used to train on data that is not created internally within the com pany that is training it. In addition to training on
any data not produced within the com pany that is training it, the com pute power need is too high which results in m assive water and
power usage. This is not the future we want. This product does not deliver and is a lie.
