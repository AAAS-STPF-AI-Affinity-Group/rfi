General Comment
This regulation is extrem ely vague and opens the door for open harvest of citizen data and m ore. I can't think of a m ore harm ful way to
bring AI to the public or, m ore aptly, bring every m em ber of the public to AI, willing or not.
I am  not in favor of the Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. It is neither a helpful
action, nor a plan.
Thanky you.
