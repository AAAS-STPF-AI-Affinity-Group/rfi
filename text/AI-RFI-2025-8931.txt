General Comment
I am  a writer who produces non-fiction technical docum ents, as well as fiction for sale and publication. Allowing OpenAI unfettered
access to m y work *without perm ission and com pensation* is a violation of m y copyrights and downright theft.
I do not believe AI, in particular generative AI, holds a place in the future of the US.
AI is overhyped and is equivalent to the false prom ises of cryptocurrency and NFTs. There is no reason for its current existence other
than to artificially inflate shareholder value. 
AI produces bad inform ation and bad art. It needs strict governm ent control along the lines of pharm aceutical developm ent.
