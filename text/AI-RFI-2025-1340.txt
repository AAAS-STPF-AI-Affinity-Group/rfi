General Comment
AI should not have any leniency in copyright that isn't already afforded to hum ans. The scale at which data scraping happens, resulting in
derivative works, has caused untold disruption in every creative field that AI has been entered into. It fails all four fair use checks and
there's no reason to change that. If an Internet personality has to get the rights to use a song for five seconds, then AI com panies
absolutely need the rights to the thousands of pieces of data they scrape every hour.
