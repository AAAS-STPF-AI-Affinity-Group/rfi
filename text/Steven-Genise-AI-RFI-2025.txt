I thoroughly oppose the government allowing AI companies to scrape copyrighted material for
training their systems. Art, writing, and music are the cornerstones of American culture.Because art is a mode of communication between humans, nothing produced by an AI couldever BE art in a strict sense, thus the theft of copyright materials, which represent the labor ofactual artists, in the creation of artâ€™s imitator, serves no purpose but to devalue Americancultural labor and put more money in the hands of tech oligarchs.
