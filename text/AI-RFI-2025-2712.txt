General Comment
The use of LLMs has been hurting the Am erican people by infringing copyright, reducing job availability as com panies incorrectly believe
it will solve problem s better than hum ans, and worsening custom er service, as, again, com panies resort to replacing real people with
m achines that can't actually help custom ers. At present, LLMs are prone to hallucinate, giving incorrect answers and solutions that do not
help people. This problem  will only get worse as the internet becom es saturated with AI generated content, where m achines will be
reading this bad data and regurgitating it back to people over and over. I believe AI, particularly LLMs should have greater restrictions in
place, not less.
