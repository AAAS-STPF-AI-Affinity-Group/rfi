General Comment
I strongly disagree with the idea of allowing OpenAI to use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI. I don't think AI has a place in the future
of the U.S. without laws and guidelines in place, as it steals jobs from  U.S. workers and consum es far too m uch energy for very little gain.
Additionally, it should not be used to control sensitive sectors, as AI m odels often produce unreliable, and often tim es, flat-out incorrect
inform ation. AI should instead be banned from  governm ent affairs and strong protections put in place in favor of Am erican workers. 
To reiterate, it steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off theft, while sim ultaneously increasing energy consum ption on our
rapidly aging infrastructure. You cannot support that while claim ing to be "for the people."
