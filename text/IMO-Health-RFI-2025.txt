Executive Summary 
 IMO Health  is a leading provider of clinical terminology and healthcare data solutions, 
dedicated to enhancing the quality and interoperability of health information. We have 
considerable expertise in the development, use, and application of various types of AI to the 
clinical and lifescience research space. Our experience in these areas includes work using 
machine learning, deep learning, and LLM models and methods. In response to the request for 
information (RFI) on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan, IMO  
Health emphasizes the critical importance of data enablement, robust terminology management, 
semantic alignment, and data provenance in healthcare AI applications. These elements are 
foundational to developing trustworthy, effective, and equitable AI systems tha t seamlessly 
integrate into clinical workflows and improve patient outcomes. IMO Health outlines below why 
we believe each element is essential for an effective AI Action plan.   
1. Data Enablement in Healthcare AI
Healthcare data is inherently complex and multifaceted, encompassing a wide range of formats, 
sources, and structures. To harness this data for AI applications, it is imperative to implement 
comprehensive data enablement strategies that facilitate access, integration, and usability of 
health information. Key considerations include: 
•Data Integration: Establishing interoperable systems that can aggregate data fromdiverse sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), laboratory systems, and
patient-generated data, to create a unified and comprehensive dataset for AI model
training.

• Data Quality Assurance: Implementing rigorous data governance frameworks to ensure 
the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data, thereby enhancing the reliability of 
AI outputs. These frameworks relate to the data presented to AI models during their 
training phase to ensure accurate results that will not cause harm to patients. Similarly, 
data (including clinical and research recommendations) must be capable of being 
explained, and related back to clearly established and defined guidelines in peer-reviewed 
scientific and clinical evidence, and evidence evaluation frameworks.  
• Ethical Data Use: Adhering to ethical standards and regulatory requirements to protect patient privacy and confidentiality, ensuring data use remains aligned with patient consent, privacy standards, and legal requirements. 
2. Terminology Management and Semantic Alignment 
Effective AI systems in healthcare rely on precise and consistent understanding of clinical 
concepts. Terminology management is pivotal in standardizing medical vocabulary, enabling 
semantic interoperability, and facilitating accurate data interpretation.  Terminology management 
and semantic alignment have the following benefits for AI models: 
• Standardization of Clinical Terms: Developing and maintaining comprehensive 
clinical terminologies that align with international standards, ensuring uniform 
interpretation of medical concepts across systems and stakeholders. This allows clear 
communications between participants in clinical care and clinical research, reducing 
errors, and allows for faster resolution of results. 
• Semantic Interoperability: Implementing mapping strategies that translate disparate coding systems into a unified language, allowing seamless data exchange and integration 
across platforms. Semantic interoperability is essential for allowing AI systems to 
perform various types of logical reasoning, such as clinical inference, and to prevent the 
introduction of hallucinations and other forms of error into results. 
• Dynamic Updates: Sta ndard Terminologies require continuous updates to reflect the 
latest domain-specific context, regulatory standards, and best practices. Medical 
Terminologies encapsulate not only Standard Terminologies but also  medical knowledge 
(e.g., diseases, procedures, labs, medications), clinical best practices, and innovations. Medical Terminologies ensure that AI systems operate with current and relevant 
information and utilize a robust source of truth with data provenance to train upon. 
3. Preparing Healthcare Data for AI Model Training 
The high dimensionality and variability of healthcare data necessitate meticulous preprocessing 
to render it suitable for AI model development. Essential steps include: 
• Data Cleaning: Identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and redundancies in 
datasets to enhance data integrity and model performance. 
• Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant data attributes to improve model accuracy and predictive capabilities.

•Handling Missing Data: To maintain dataset robustness, appropriate techniques, such as
imputation methods or leveraging auxiliary information, should be employed to address
gaps in data.
4. Provenance and Transparency in AI Models
Ensuring the traceability and transparency of AI models is crucial for building trust among 
clinicians and patients. IMO Health advocates for: 
•Clear Documentation: Maintaining detailed records of data sources, preprocessing
steps, and model development processes to facilitate reproducibility and accountability.
•Explainability: Designing AI models that provide interpretable outputs, enablingclinicians to understand and trust AI-driven recommendations and decisions.
•Continuous Monitoring: Implementing systems to track AI model performance overtime, ensuring sustained accuracy, early detection of model drift, and proactive bias
mitigation.
5. Additional Considerations
To further enhance the development and deployment of AI in healthcare, IMO Health 
recommends an AI action plan include the following: 
•AI Governance Frameworks: Establishing policies and oversight mechanisms that
guide the ethical development and application of AI, addressing issues such as bias,
fairness, and accountability.
•Collaboration and Stakeholder Engagement: Fostering partnerships among healthcareproviders, technology developers, policymakers, and patients to co -create AI solutions
aligned with clinical needs and societal values.
•Investment in Education and Training: Developing programs to equip healthcare
professionals with the knowledge and skills to effectively utilize AI tools, ensuring that
technological advancements translate into improved patient care.
Conclusion 
IMO Health  is committed to advancing AI in healthcare through robust data enablement, precise 
terminology management, and unwavering dedication to data quality and transparency. By 
addressing these critical areas, the forthcoming AI Action Plan can lay a strong foun dation for AI 
innovations that are ethical, effective, and centered on enhancing patient outcomes.
