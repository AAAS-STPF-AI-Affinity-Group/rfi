General Comment
To whom  it m ay concernâ€“
I want to echo the m any voices com m enting their concerns with an "AI at all costs" approach; we are giving private, self-interested groups
unfettered access to profit off of the creative works of m any hardworking Am ericans, and for what? To consolidate all that m oney (and
therefore, power) at the top? We need to establish a system  that m akes sure that the path forward with AI does not pervert the flow of
m oney and power in our society; m oney should flow back to the com m on Am erican, and these tech firm s hoard m oney for them selves
and their investors.
"AI at all costs" is not an issue of national security, it's an anti-Am erican power and m oney grab by these AI com panies at the Am erican
peoples' expense. We cannot allow this.
