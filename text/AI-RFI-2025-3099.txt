General Comment
It seem s like poor planning to let large corporations that have already abused copyrighted m aterials to have even m ore access to private
content. It seem s likely to greatly dam age m uch of the creative pursuits in Am erica if the creators have not even the appearance of a way
to protect their works from  being stolen and regurgitated by any AI that cares to scrape their works. Besides, there should be m ore focus
on preventing over reliance on AI than on building m achines to churn out m eaningless pieces of m edia that is only going to profit already
engorged corporations at the cost of further straining natural resources and energy. It would be better to focus AI developm ent on
tediously repetitious tasks that take away from  peopleâ€™s lives than to try and stom p out any creative hum an work in a m ad scram bling for
additional corporate profiteering.
