General Comment
Please reconsider. It's on ly gonna be disastrous if you give more power to AI compan ies. It will take away jobs from people and 
will just absol utely destroy the econom y. No one even likes the generated images that the AI does! It's al ways so &^% u p and 
creepy and easi ly used for spreadi ng misinformation in the Internet. 
Please, instead of protect ing these AI companies, put the effort into helping the peop le who needs it.
