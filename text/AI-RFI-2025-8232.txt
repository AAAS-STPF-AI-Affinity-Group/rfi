General Comment
This over focus on Ai is folly and directly dam aged artists and authors both financially and em otionally. It is not fair use for oneâ€™s work to
be scraped off the internet and repurposed without consent or com pensation. LLM need to respect copyright and they do NoT. Their use
harm s artists and debases their creations and even the end user is harm ed as they used AI instead of their own honest labor
