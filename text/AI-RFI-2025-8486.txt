General Comment
I’m  an artist. I love m aking art. Yes I m ight gripe about parts of the process taking tim e or being tedious, but art is an act of expression.
Generative AI sees art as a m eans to an end. Its overinflated valuation is based entirely on the acts of expression that it guzzled down
without perm ission. It treats art as output. As a product. It’s gross. Artists of all kinds have pushed back against AI. Listen to us please.
