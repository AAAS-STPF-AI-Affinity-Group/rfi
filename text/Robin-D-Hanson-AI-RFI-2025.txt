What should be “U.S. policy for sustaining and enhancing America's AI dominance in order to
promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security”?
 
Do nothing . Whatever we are now doing, stop that. Don’t especially subsidize or regulate AI.
Just allow a global free market in AI. AI has not shown special risks, harms, or features thatdeserve special consideration. So deter any AI harms, and promote AI benefits, via the usuallaws and legal liability that apply to tech and commerce in general.
 
Who am I? I was an AI researcher for nine years, and have been a professor of economics fortwenty five years. Some related writings of mine
