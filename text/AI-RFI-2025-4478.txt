General Comment
Allowing an AI com pany to com pletely ignore copyright law is an awful idea, tech com panies should not be allowed to legally steal the
hard work and creations of actual people. There is no societal benefit to theft of creative works, but there is societal benefit to hum an-
m ade art, and allowing AI com panies to steal intellectual property will stifle artistic creativity and artistic business. Please do not allow
OpenAI to ram pantly steal the hard work of artists and creatives with no recourse for those affected.
