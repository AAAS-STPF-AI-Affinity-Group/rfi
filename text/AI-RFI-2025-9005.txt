General Comment
Firstly, m y ability to fully utilize AI assistants in ways I find m ost beneficial is significantly ham pered by copyright restrictions. However, I
strongly oppose any form al exem ption for OpenAI and Google from  these restrictions. Such an exem ption would fundam entally
underm ine copyright principles.
Allowing corporations that aggressively protect their own intellectual property to freely exploit the work of others is inherently unjust. This
would exacerbate the existing power im balance, further shifting our society towards prioritizing corporate interests over those of
individuals.
The opaque nature of AI m odel training m akes this issue particularly concerning. This exem ption could represent a point of no return,
effectively granting these corporations unchecked control over creative output.
My concern isn't a dystopian fear of AI overlords. Rather, it's the certainty that this would accelerate the erosion of hum an creative
agency. We would be handing control of creative endeavors to corporations, built upon the intellectual labor they appropriate, prioritizing
profit over societal benefit.
Furtherm ore, regarding national security, it's well-established that m any corporations seeking this access are international in practice, if not
in form al registration. Granting them  such perm issions directly contradicts the goal of enhancing national security. This is particularly
concerning given the potential conflicts of interest within the current adm inistration and its advisory team , including individuals like Elon
Musk.
