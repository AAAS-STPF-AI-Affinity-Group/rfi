General Comment
As an artist, I am  opposed to artificial intelligence being allowed to scrape the internet and steal thousands upon thousands of people's
works. AI as it is right now is com pletely and disgracefully underregulated- huge tech com panies use it to censor dissenting opinions and
spread inform ation that is just utterly false.
60% of AI search engine answers are verifiable wrong- that shouldn't be allowed.
And AI generated im ages, sound and text created from  copyrighted artworks/photography/literature/m usic can not be considered fair-
use! It is theft and the com panies like OpenAI should in fact be forced to erase their datasets and repay the thousands of creators they
have violated the copyright of.
Do you want AI to take the jobs of m any talented Am erican creators? I sure hope not. Prevent that by enforcing copyright and regulating
the m achine.
