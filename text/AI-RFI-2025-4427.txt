General Comment
Generative AI is stealing and profiting off of the careers and livelihoods of Am ericans, and I believe it does not deserve a place in our
governm ent. It is a detrim ent to our environm ent. It is actively m aking the truth harder to discern from  falsely generated im ages and is a
waste of m oney.
