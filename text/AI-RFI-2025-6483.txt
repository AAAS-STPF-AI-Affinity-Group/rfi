General Comment
Artificial intelligence is a still developing technology which already incurs incredible costs in its inaccuracy
(https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/we-com pared-eight-ai-search-engines-theyre-all-bad-at-citing-news.php), energy usage
(https://www.nytim es.com /2024/07/11/clim ate/artificial-intelligence-energy-usage.htm l), and dependence on hum an work. Though
proponents suggest AI m ight offer incredible benefits to society, AI m erits extensive regulation. It is not in the interests of the United States
or hum an kind in general to offer the tech industry writ large, and AI com panies specifically, special support or treatm ent.
AI com panies should follow existing law and respect the incredible creativity of writers and artists (by either paying for/licensing their
works or not using them ). In addition, AI com panies should have to dem onstrate how their products actually m ove m ankind into the future
rather than recreating biases of the past.
