General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. It's both exceptionally dangerous to creatives, but also is highly m isleading and
generates m isinform ation on a trem endous scale. 
AI profits off of theft of creatives' works en m asse, and is a m assive danger to creative freedom  everywhere in the US. No com pany
should be above the law for any reason, especially theft of others' work.
