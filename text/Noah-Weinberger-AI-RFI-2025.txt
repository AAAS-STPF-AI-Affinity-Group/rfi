To whom it may concern at NSF: The ongoing Generative AI revolution has the potential to 
significantly enhance the lives of autistic people by solving critical issues facing many people 
with disabilities, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The large st impact for this 
demographic exists in the services industry, such as personal communication, K -12 and higher 
education, and general social involvement across all stages of life. Large Language Models 
(LLMs) and similar AI technologies have already been shown to improve social interaction, 
create individualized learning experiences, and close the communication gap between autistic 
and neurotypical people. Still more work needs to be done to fulfill the promise of innovation. In 
my opinion, generative AI a s a tool for the service industry ought to be developed and possibly 
regulated in active collaboration with the autistic community. Many promises of AI aren't 
necessarily designed to meet the unique needs of autistic individuals. Many autistic individuals 
don’t struggle with social connection because they lack the desire to engage with others, but 
because traditional communication norms weren’t built with neurodiverse perspectives in mind. 
AI-powered tools can help bridge this gap by offering real -time supp ort in interpreting social 
cues, suggesting contextually appropriate responses, and making interactions smoother. In 
education, AI can adapt to different learning styles, allowing for flexible pacing and multimodal 
approaches that make information more acc essible and engaging. The success of generative AI 
as a social tool depends on how much weight is given to autistic perspectives and how directly 
autistic people are involved in its development. Too often, well -intentioned interventions fall 
short because they are designed from a neurotypical perspective rather than being informed by 
the actual lived experiences of autistic individuals. Generative AI should be used to help autistic 
people as they are, rather than forcing them to conform to neurotypical norm s. For example, AI -
powered social coaching tools should prioritize allowing autistic users to interact in ways that are 
comfortable for them, rather than encouraging them to "mask" or conceal their natural 
tendencies. Privacy and data security are also imp ortant considerations. Many autistic people rely 
on artificial intelligence (AI) for delicate or intensely intimate interactions, such as social 
practice, mental health assistance, and business communication. AI models must be built, 
developed, and deploye d with total transparency and fairness. Transparency protocols ensure AI 
models are utilized properly by Americans, and aren't unintentionally harming our most 
vulnerable. The National Science Foundation has played an important role in developing AI 
research for the public good. By directing funds, resources, and expertise toward AI initiatives 
that address the unique needs of autistic Americans, the National Science Foundation can help 
ensure that technological innovation benefits those who need it most. T his is an important time in 
AI development. Thoughtful, inclusive research could change generative AI from a white -collar 
productivity tool into a product that actively supports independence, self advocacy, accessibility, 
and inclusion. NSF support will en sure AI is molded into a force that amplifies neurodivergent 
voices, making technology more flexible, responsive, and in tune with real -world needs. Noah
