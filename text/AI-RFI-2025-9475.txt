General Comment
There are so m any better things AI could be used for than stealing from  the works of hum ans. AI is a powerful beast that needs to be
regulated, and letting it go unchained as is would be disastrous to m any creative fields. It is not a trusted technology by the general public
for a reason, and NVIDIA's m assive stock drop as a result of their failing cam paign on AI technology was no accident.
