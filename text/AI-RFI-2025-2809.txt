General Comment
Approving this plan will ultim ately be a detrim ent to our country, not just as creators but for the businesses ignorantly seeking this
m ovem ent in the first place. They seek a m eans of accessing our content without consequence, but fail to see that they them selves would
be left vulnerable to the loopholes that would be born of this unregulated access. Worse, they m ay attem pt to m onopolize the data they've
scraped through additional action, leading to what could be the greatest act of public thievery to known history.
As an artist m yself, m y own personal em otions cannot be contained in regards to this blatant, desperate show of corporate greed. If one
day I see an eerie sim ulacrum , sim ilar to m y own work, it would all but crush m y spirit. These people do not care about the life behind the
near incalculable am ount of art being m ade and shared on the internet. They m erely seek to squeeze as m uch profit out of a trend that they
them selves have artificially extended them selves for the sake of m oney.
Analytics show that the downfall of ai as a com petent business m odel is im possible to avoid, and that its profitability, despite their own
greedy efforts, is on the decline. Don't allow them  to upend our legal system  just so they can go on beating a dying horse for all its worth.
