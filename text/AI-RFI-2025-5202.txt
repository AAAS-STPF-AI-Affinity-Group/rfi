General Comment
I am  a business owner and software developer. I have created software that is used by m illions of people around the world. Allowing AI
com panies to steal m y work is the death of m y Am erican dream . Organizations like OpenAI are fleecing the Am erican people by trying to
convince us that they need to steal our work in order to fatten their bank accounts. Governm ent endorsed theft of this scale would be a
m assive harm  to our future econom y. 
If they want to use the efforts of creators and businesses, they can com pensate those creators and businesses just like anyone else who
cam e before the AI hype started.
