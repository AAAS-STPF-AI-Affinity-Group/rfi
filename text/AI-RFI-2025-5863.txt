General Comment
This is a horrible idea. It’s an existential threat to the livelihoods of artists and creatives everywhere, not to m ention that AI has been
proven tim e and tim e again to produce incorrect, biased, and hallucinatory data. Plus, it’s social suicide - using AI generated assets just
m akes a person or organization look like a cheap loser. Do not give these com panies any m ore power!
