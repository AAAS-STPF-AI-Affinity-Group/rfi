General Comment
As a visual artist and as an arts educator I am  terrified of a future that allows the strip m ining of our entire cultural heritage for the sole
financial benefit of a tech oligarchy. A skilled creative is facing the prospect of being usurped by a technological doppleganger of a skilled
creative, an app which was trained using the work, data, and intellectual property of other skilled creatives entirely without their consent or
com pensation. This is the m oral equivalent of the m ost brutal colonization. A cowardly and depraved from  skilled, productive, working
people to the elites. Our society will be all the m ore poorer, financially, aesthetically and m orally if this goes forward.
