General Comment
Developing AI in its current form  requires "training" it on already created literature. This m aterial is copyrighted, and the authors and rights
holders have NOT BEEN ASKED FOR THAT PERMISSION. AI in its current form  neither asks copyright holders for perm ission nor
recom penses them . THIS IS THEFT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND MUST BE PROHIBITED. 
Furtherm ore, AI in its current form  has not shown a large-scale utility or profitability. Allowing its developers to violate copyright am ounts
to large-scale dam age to Am erica's powerful IP environm ent without any corresponding reward.
