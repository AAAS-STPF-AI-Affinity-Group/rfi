General Comment
Open AI should not have this kind of access proposed in the executive order. This leads to a dangerous invasion of public privacy, but it
also will lead to incredible am ou ts of copy right infringem ent. This order would help OpenAI at the expense of Am erican citizens, it
should not be allowed.
