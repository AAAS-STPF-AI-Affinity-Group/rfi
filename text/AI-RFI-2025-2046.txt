General Comment
AI generated im agery exploits the work of artists by violating copyright laws and refusing to credit or otherwise provide com pensation. It
creates and actively prom otes m isinform ation, and takes an im m ense am ount of energy that becom es m ore and m ore dam aging as we
continue to hurdle towards clim ate catastrophe. It is being used by corporations as a get rich quick schem e that cuts out hum an intelligence
and creativity with very little focus on any practical or beneficial applications. It is a weapon that could have been a tool, and it highlights
the disregard for people, art, accurate inform ation and the planet.
