General Comment
As a sm all artist who m akes content for YouTube, I am  com pletely against giving freedom  to OpenAI for source to hard work of others
without cost. Not only does Generative AI create a product in direct com petition with m illions of artists on the internet, it does so using an
algorithm  trained on the works of those sam e artists it seeks to replace. This is, plain and sim ple, theft of intellectual property.
Furtherm ore, the works OpenAI creates is often produced in m ass with lim ited oversight, causing it to lack artistic m erit or, in the case of
inform ational m aterial like som e YouTube videos or articles, contain incorrect and m isleading inform ation with no sense of intention from
its creator. AI can be a valuable tool to m ake our lives easier, but not without oversight, and not without protecting the rights of artists to
own their work.
