General Comment
While OpenAI seeks to add value to their product, they seem  to seek to exploit the m illions of creators & com panies that have
established their own value while respecting the current tradem ark, copyright, and licensing laws. Why should the governm ent be
responsible for OpenAI's failings?
Considering OpenAI cannot achieve its goals within the m eans of the law, it suggests that the business and concept are not sufficiently
developed for its purported application. A governm ent "bail-out" of ANY kind to START a business does not bode well for the future
prospects of said business.
