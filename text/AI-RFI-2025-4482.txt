General Comment
Generative AI is unprecedented technology. It is not a vector that produces consistent outputs. It is not a person with its own creative will.
Not yet, at least. Generative AI is som ewhere between.
Generative AI needs to be regulated, scrutinized, and leashed. It is fine to operate in infancy unrestrained, as professionals analyze its
purpose and consequence, but that tim e has passed. 
Generative AI has blatantly shown to derive content in ways that fundam entally differ from  Hum an inspiration. AI generated content has
swam ped Am erican social m edia with uncanny art that threatens to steal attention and profits from  actual Am erican content producers.
Chatbots frequently report erroneous inform ation, and the m ass-production of AI-generated m edia facilitates m isinform ation cam paigns.
Restrictions need to happen, and soon.
