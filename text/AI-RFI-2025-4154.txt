General Comment
AI will ultim ately be used by the ultra-rich to hoard m ore wealth, endanger m any jobs, and harm  the self-reliance of m any Am ericans if
relied on too heavily.
Also, AI needs to be trained on copyrighted data without the express perm ission of the copyright holder. Anything else is theft.
Furtherm ore, "art" created by AI is worthless, soulless trash that has no place in the cultural heritage of this country.
