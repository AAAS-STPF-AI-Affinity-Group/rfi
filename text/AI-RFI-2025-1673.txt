General Comment
Please don't let AI steal m y artwork and everyone else's creative work and protect copyright laws, all we want AI to do is do our dishes
and laundry so we can focus on our creative works not steal them ,we hum ans have done art for along tim e and if you replace that with
som ething soulles then you'll m ake a joyless dystopia, at least find another way instead of using copyright m aterial or anything
