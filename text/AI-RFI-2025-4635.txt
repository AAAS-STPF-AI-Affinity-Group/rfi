General Comment
AI exists purely to steal works and present inferior, poorly m ade copies of them .
It will result in an untold wave of m isinform ation and garbage data and com pletely dem olish Am erica's education, m edia and m ore.
Am erican jobs will be stolen and done in extrem ely inferior ways by m achines that do not understand actual hum an nuance. By allowing
AI fair use, you will be giving in to a grift that serves to destroy Am erican literacy and our inform ation security. Nothing good will com e of
this.
