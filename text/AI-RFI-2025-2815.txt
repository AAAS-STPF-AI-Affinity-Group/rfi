General Comment
I hope this letter finds you well. I am  writing to express m y deep concerns regarding the significant investm ents in artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies, particularly in term s of the allocation of taxpayer m oney and the apparent lack of tangible, long-term  benefits these
technologies have delivered thus far.
It has becom e increasingly clear that m any AI initiatives fail to deliver on their initial prom ises. Rather than em powering society, these
technologies often perpetuate inefficiencies, introduce new com plexities, and create system s that are difficult for the average person to
understand or control. In m any cases, AI projects have proven to be costly, over-hyped, and ultim ately underwhelm ing in their im pact.
They are the Beanie Babies of the 21st century.
I strongly believe that taxpayer m oney should be allocated to projects and technologies that provide clear and direct benefits to society.
At a tim e when there are critical issues such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and clim ate change that require urgent attention, it is
troubling that substantial funds are being directed towards AI system s that, in m any instances, only serve to further the interests of private
corporations rather than solving real-world problem s.
Furtherm ore, there is growing evidence that AI system s can exacerbate existing inequalities, underm ine privacy, and even replace hum an
jobs, creating m ore harm  than good. The lack of regulation and oversight surrounding AI developm ent only adds to the risks, and as a
result, I worry that continued investm ent in AI could prove to be a m isguided and costly endeavor.
I urge you and your colleagues to reconsider the direction of public funding in this area. We m ust ensure that taxpayer dollars are being
spent in ways that are genuinely beneficial and that prioritize the well-being of our com m unities. It is crucial that any future investm ents in
AI are carefully scrutinized, with clear goals and m easurable outcom es that directly benefit the public.
Thank you for your tim e and consideration. I trust that you will take these concerns seriously and work towards a m ore responsible
allocation of resources.
Sincerely, Nem o Hana
