The use of copyrighted works in the training data of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is nothing short 
of en abling the wholesale theft and plagiarism on a massive scale. This will greatly affect - but is 
not limited to - living artists, authors, designers an d computer programmers. At absolute 
minimum, those people deserve control of their works and their ingestion into the training data. This includes, but is not limited to, removal of their work from the training data, ledgers to maintain what output was created derived from their work and and financial compensation for any output derived from their work featured in the training data. However, I have nearly no faith that this Government will work to enforce the rights of artists and creatives and to that end - I anticipate you will go full- steam ahead in the acceleration of AI. If so - I look forward to when 
China again manages to undercut our efforts for pennies-on-the dollar and all we have to show for it is a complete lack of cultural value. Reduced to a bi llion generated images that convey no 
emotion, music that resonates with as much value as elevator music and programming that is inefficient and of poor design.
