 Re: National Science Foundation’s Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial 
 Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
 I don’t think OpenAI or any other one of these companies with an inflated value is selling anything other 
 than snake oil. But I also think there’s nothing that generative AI will do that isn’t harmful. These things 
 will either destroy a massive number of jobs all over the world and wreck the economy, make World 
 War 3 happen with fake audio or video or images destroying all intelligence gathering, or both.
