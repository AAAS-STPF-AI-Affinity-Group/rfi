I worked in the public sector, in law enforcement electronic communications, and in the private 
sector as an investigator specializing in TSCM (Technical Surveillance Counter Measures). As a 
military reservist, was involved with instruction and planning of  radio communications. These 
technical fields made me very aware of the need to keep communications (and in the broader 
sense, the internet, computers, phones and apps) secure and safe from all adversaries and hostile 
entities. I strongly support the Devel opment of an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan, but with a 
few caveats: (1) US national security, and US dominance must be first and foremost in all 
aspects of the AI plan. (2) There must be controls of "big tech". Remember the recent problems 
with US bi g tech (and foreign) influencers, blacklisting, cancel -culture, political interference and 
censorship? So, is not hard to imagine China (CCP) or other bad actors doing much more 
damage with hostile AI; hijacking our AI, or false -flag AI operations. Thank y ou.
