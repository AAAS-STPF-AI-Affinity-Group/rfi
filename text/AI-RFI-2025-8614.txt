General Comment
The need for AI m ust not override the governm entâ€™s m andate to regulate AI and all em erging through strong protections against intentional
and unintentional m isuse. The argum ent by those with too close a voice to the federal governm ent that the need for action outweighs the
need for prudent protective m easures is shortsighted and presents a dangerously high risk to the Am erican public. I strongly urge the
federal governm ent to reconsider lifting or otherwise reducing the regulatory requirem ents for AI research and developm ent.
