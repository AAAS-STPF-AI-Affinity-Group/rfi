General Comment
AI is terrible for a m ultitude of reasons, m ore so in the hands of a governm ent that does not care about consequences. Mistakes will be
m ade using AI services that will kill hundreds if not thousands of people. Machine Learning can never and will never replace the need for
actual hum an intervention and thinking.
That doesn't even touch on the fact AI is a waste of finite resources and is quite frankly a poor, erratic product that does not accom plish
what it sets out to do in the first place.
