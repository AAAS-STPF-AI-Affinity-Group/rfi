General Comment
Setting the precedent that Am erican innovation can be stolen without consequence is dangerous and deeply m isguided. Uphold copyright
law to protect creatives and entrepreneurs of all stripes. SIGNED, a sm all business owner whose hard work has been stolen by these
sloppy, predatory "AI" datasets.
