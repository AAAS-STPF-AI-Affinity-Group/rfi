General Comment
Generative AI m odels require enorm ous am ounts of data to trainâ€”they steal the art and effort of tens of MILLIONS of honest,
hardworking Am erican artists and writers, and put it into a m achine to fuel profits for corporate bigwigs and destroy the livelihood of the
very people it stole from . There is NO ethical use of existing generative AI m odels. Law MUST be strengthened to protect artists, writers,
and m ore from  the plagiarism  and theft com m itted on a m assive scale by OpenAI and other such com panies. These com panies cannot be
allowed to continue their scam  on the Am erican people.
