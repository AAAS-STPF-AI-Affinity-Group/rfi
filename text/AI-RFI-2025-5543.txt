General Comment
AI is absolutely terrible, inaccurate, and a threat to all hum an creativity. Giving Big Tech a blank check to steal the work of literally
everyone to use up m assive energy resources only to end up with a flawed, inaccurate product is insanity. No one wants AI, no one
voluntarily uses it, it is just thrust on us by a tech industry that has invested far too m uch m oney into a product that is NEVER going to be
the utopian tool that they prom ised. Now, their last hail-m ary is to convince the US governm ent to invest in this m oney sink-hole at the
expense of every single hum an being on earth. This is a GRIFT. Do not fall for it.
