General Comment
AI is a big corporate scam  used to steal from  hard working individuals in order to prom ote stagnation and slop. AI cannot exist without
stealing from  artists, therefor, it should not exist at all. It is trying to m ake the artist obsolete, which in turn will rem ove the thing in which it
will steal from . As such AI will becom e stagnant rapidly as the only thing it can produce or steal is from  itself or other AI algorithm s.
It is a straight violation of m odern copyright laws when any individual creates som ething. These corporate goons want the ability to take
our work for free!
There is no threat or interest to 'national security' here, this is a desperate attem pt to rem ove the one barrier keeping them  out. Once that
barrier is gone, it's over. AI is not in com petition with itself as it is a failing product, the investm ents provided to it over the years have
yielded net losses for com panies as they continue to waste funding on it. Do the right thing and let AI Action Plan die.
