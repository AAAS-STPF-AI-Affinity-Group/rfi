General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft of hard working people.
AI is nothing m ore than a fleeting trend the eyes of the Am erican public that does nothing but degrade the standards of our country.
