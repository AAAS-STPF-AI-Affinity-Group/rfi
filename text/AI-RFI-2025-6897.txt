General Comment
Allowing a private com pany like OpenAI to ignore intellectual property laws is dangerous and irresponsible. AI is a technological cul-de-
sac, its results are by nature unreliable and non-replicable. Stop wasting m oney and resources on this nonsense and invest in real hum ans
instead. Researchers, scientists, writers and artists. That will produce value.
