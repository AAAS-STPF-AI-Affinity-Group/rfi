General Comment
This disregard of prior copyright protection in the interest of AI progress is troubling, additionally it sets a precedent that hurts the legal
protection of copyright and its enforcem ent. What would be a fair alternate is for a licensing agreem ent - to ensure som e form  of
com pensation for the copyright holders. Additionally it is critical to safeguard the right to refuse access to m aterial where copyright is
established - else it enables the use and abuse of copyrighted m aterials for profit by third parties (i.e. the owners/developers of the AI
agents), m any of whom  have already violated existing copyright law in training their m odels, and are seeking to whitewash their past
crim inal actions (described above) by lobbying for this exception. 
The provision of AI agent-services by these com panies to their clients is a for-profit arrangem ent. The only way to ensure responsible use
of copyrighted m aterials is by levying usage fees for copyrighted training content - which m ay then be reflected in the cost of user/client
subscriptions. Let the free m arket decide whether the services offered are worth the true cost of training data that has been used to train
the AI agents, and the profits of the com panies offering these services be truly representative of their contributions to the developm ent of
the AI offering.
