Generative AI relies on stealing the copyright and intellectual property of other fields,
encourages stealing personal information of the general public, and produces the mostvalueless median output possible. Gen AI actively poisons any field it touches, including otherfields of Generative AI. As a professional computational linguist, I've seen my field absolutelydestroyed by companies fundamentally not understanding AI, and over investing in it, insteadof standard machine learning solutions, like phoneme recognition and language modeling thatuses human written grammars. 
As a professional that works in tech, AI is damaging to every company I've worked for, and
has set my field back by decades. Do not let it utilize unaware user's data, steal artist's work, oruse any form of copywritten media or protected data.
