General Comment
Generative AI is bad for the econom y. VC firm s have placed exuberant am ounts of capital into businesses that have higher operating costs
than capital inputs. Many stable funds and accounts of Am erican are diversified in these VC firm s and AI com panies and a collapse is
near, as there is not enough training data. Do not prop up the AI industry.
