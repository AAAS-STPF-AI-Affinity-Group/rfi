General Comment
It's entirely possible to develop AI technology without underm ining the value of hum an work and creativity. So called 'innovations' that
disregard copyright and hum an labor are not inevitable, despite what anyone claim s. Moving forward as we are now threaten hum anity, it
is a recipe for societal rot. We can do this thoughtfully and in a way that benefits hum ankind.
