Zac Goldfain, 
My name is Zac  Goldfain and I am a 2nd semester senior at AVonworth High School, I 
studied ge nerative AI and its impact on Sports Management for two months in a course on 
AI and Ethics this year. From my research, I think this current administration's viewpoint on 
AI regulation is putting our nation in the right direction. While researching AI in Sports 
Management, I was able to see various ways in which AI was beneﬁcial to those in the ﬁeld. 
Sports in our country are one of, if not the most televised thi ngs of today. They create unity 
with fanbases and competitive rivalries that many people live for. AI's impact on sports has continued to grow rapidly and with our new administration, I believe American sports can become the largest worldwide in every aspect. With AI's improvements, many big sports 
teams have been able to collect data and quickly ﬁnd ways to improve their teams. 
Whether it's player health, game strategy, or behind-the -scenes management, AI has 
simpliﬁed the sports world and made sports safer for athletes while also growing viewership for fans. Athletes are what allow us to watch sports, therefore making their health and safety a priority. AI's new developments have allowed medical staff to track 
player injuries and healing progress, giving  athletes the ability to play at their peak 
performance. If we continue to develop AI in the right direction, it will signiﬁcantly help in 
the sports world, which we all know and love in our nation.
