General Comment
Please don't allow this. 
Com panies should not be allowed to sue regular people into oblivion for copyright infringem ent and then turn around and claim  they can
"pirate" whatever they want so they can m ake new products with other people's inform ation. This is ridiculous. This shouldn't even need to
be said. I don't understand how this is a valid argum ent in 2025. Just sad.
