General Comment
We all know that this executive order action plan is m eant to bolster the tech industry with a technology that frankly doesn't contribute
anything to society. It doesn't even contribute anything to the econom y, given that pretty m uch every AI com pany has lost m oney for the
past several years! Replacing a hum an's labor with AI results in (som etim es extrem ely dangerous) m isinform ation, bad quality service, and
far-reach and consequences in every industry. AI is trying to disrupt m any industries without any safety nets for the people who work in
those industries, need those industries for their own day-to-day life, and quite frankly for the com panies that try to em ploy AI. Point blank,
this is a waste of tim e and a waste of m oney and we all know that it is a ploy to appease Elon Musk. Until the AI industry gets better and
actually delivers on its prom ises, there should be no reason why we have such a robust AI action plan. We are putting the cart before the
horse, and as a result m any people are going to get thrown under the bus!
