General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is the absolute worst way forward for a culture already sucked into false reality through electronics and technology
they can't differentiate between. Hum an MINDS are the center of all things creative, and com puters can only spit out what you tell it.
END THE PURGE OF HUMAN MINDS
END THE TAKEOVER BY TECH
END THE UNEDUCATED ABSORPTION OF AI
Rem em ber,just because it seem s cool at first, doesn't m ean it's actually cool.
