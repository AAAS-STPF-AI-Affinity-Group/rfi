My name is Braden Gregory, and I've been an artist for decades, and have
slowly grown my skills the entire time. It's absolute theft letting somegiant big company just scrub everything I've ever done over 30 or moreyears from the internet, which was out there to try and grow my ownbusiness, throw it in a blender with everyone else's art and hit abutton to pop up something they can sell in just a few seconds. It's yetanother unteathered tool for the ultra wealthy to harvest the work andefforts and skill of everyone too poor to sue them and stop them and getthemselves even more and more and more wealthy.
The government needs to limit and break up monopolies that these very
few people have over the rest of us, or the unfettered growth ofcapatalism will choke us all.
