General Comment
Generative AI does not have a place in the future of the United States. While AI is ultim ately going to becom e im portant, whether we
want it to or not, the current m ethods of obtaining training data are im m oral, if not downright illegal, due to legal precedent set in the past.
Worse, Deepseekr-1 has shown that OpenAI's m ethods are inefficient and expensive to m aintain. The ecological im pact of training AI as
it currently stands consum es ridiculous am ounts of energy and, in m any cases, precious freshwater resources to cool these training centers.
Many argue that the grid "can't support an all-electric lifestyle," yet are blind to the fact that this includes AI.
As an Am erican, AI steals from  m y livelihood and profits off of theft. It inhibits the free thought, creativity, and originality that m ake this
nation unique and wonderful. There is nothing about it that is beneficial to national security. Please do not give AI carte blanche to continue
to steal and harm  the Am erican people.
