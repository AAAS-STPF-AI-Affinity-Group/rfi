General Comment
Generative AI goes against the spirit of Am erica - it steals the hard work of Am erican artists and swipes m oney right out of their pockets,
funneling it to a few who see them selves as above the law. Skill needs to generate rewards for Am erica to function, and generative AI is
not a skill. Handing m oney to lazy thieves will bankrupt the country and cost it its best and brightest.
