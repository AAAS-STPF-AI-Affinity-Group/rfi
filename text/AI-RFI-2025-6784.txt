General Comment
As an author, I strongly oppose proposals to give generative AI com panies the ability to use others' work without regard to copyright and
com pensation. Copyright and fair com pensation are not "unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents". Generative AI training m odels steal
from  authors' and artists' livelihood as Am ericans and profit off of theft. Generative AI com panies are overvalued and m ajor CEOs have
adm itted that they can not m ake a profit without being able to steal others' copyrighted work. Generative AI com panies should stand and
fall on their own m erits- which includes fairly com pensating authors and artists and getting their perm ission to use their work to train their
datasets. There is no good reason for the federal governm ent to step in and prop up this industry if it can not m ake it on its own.
