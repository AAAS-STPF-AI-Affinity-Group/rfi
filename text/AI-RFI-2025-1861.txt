General Comment
I am  a com ic book author and illustrator, m aking art is m y livelihood. I am  a staunchly against generative AI and the illegal way they take
everyone's content and use it to train their m odels without com pensating artists for the work it's taken them  years to perfect. This attack
on everyone's copyright to allow the continuing training of AI is both im m oral and detrim ental for the econom y, as it will kill m illions of
jobs in illustration and art. Not only that, but it would affect every level of the entertainm ent sector, including m usic com panies like
Universal Music, m ovies, and even program s. GenAI needs to be lim ited, required to contact every author whose work they're trying to
train their m odels on, offer both com pensation AND royalties every tim e their work is used as a base for som ething, and forced to respect
the author's decision if they decline their request.
