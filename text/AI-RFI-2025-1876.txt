General Comment
As an artist who lives in these united states, we should be united against AI. What once could've been a tool used to aid the artists has
becam e a shortcut that robs them , and they deserve not only recom pense but certainty that their works will not be fed into m achines
incapable of providing the soul that art needs in order to m ake a statem ent. I don't expect the soulless to understand this but if you have
any decency left in your shriveled, darkened, crum pled up garbage bag of an organ you call your heart, you'd oppose this plan in an
instant, otherwise the sheep shall be led with a shepherd's crook held with seven digits.
