General Comment
AI com panies should be held to the rules of the land and not get a special carve out for harm ing Am ericans and their works. AI is purely
hype and is ultim ately not the future for writing or art. AI also should not be used in schools. It has issues with their output. Many of the
answers it outputs are lies.
