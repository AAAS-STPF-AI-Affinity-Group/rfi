Mankind is rapidly approaching a future cleanly divided by two paths; one which leads to a
utopia and the other leading to a dystopia. A fast AI ramp takeoff
 supported by national
investment with strong alignment regulations and a multi-government hardware kill-switch isthe best path forward for ensuring that Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is both safe andbeneficial to humanity.
 
ASI represents the single most important human endeavor, offering solutions to existentialrisks, scientific frontiers, and economic abundance. However, it is also the most significantnational security priority—the first nation or entity to achieve ASI will control the trajectoryof global power, economic leadership, and technological supremacy.
To balance rapid progress with safety, a regulatory framework should enforce:
1. Mandatory alignment testing for AI systems, ensuring robust value alignment before
deployment.
2. A multi-government-controlled hardware shutoff, providing a last-resort safeguard
against misaligned AGI/ASI threats.
3. Taxation of AI entities to fund a Universal Basic Income (UBI), mitigating labor
displacement and maintaining societal stability.
ASI will not wait for slow consensus. The first to the finish line dictates the rules. The US
government must act decisively to ensure that ASI is developed safely, remains in humancontrol, and is deployed for universal benefit—not just private gain.
