History is not going to look kindly on this proposed AI Action Plan from the 2025 US Administration, 
which is a transparently corrupt, corporate pseudo-legal grab at the rights of others for the short- term 
profit of the wealthy. I ’m extremely pleased to make my dissent part of the public record.  
The p rivate sector should be hampered in its pursuit of the current incarnations of AI, which were 
initiated using unethical means, including but not limited to illegal copyright and privacy infringements, and the further development of which has no environmentally sustainable path going forward. AI is currently being used to replace human labor rather than make our jobs easier for us. There must be more legislation and more restrictions placed on its use to protect human civil rights, not fewer.  
There  is no hurry to develop AI except from the people who stand to profit; citizens of the United 
States can live our lives as safely and freely as we have been without it while a slower, more responsible approach is taken. The need for “ America ’s AI dominance ” is coming exclusively from men 
who are old enough and rich enough that they feel they won’ t have to suffer the consequences.  
Execut ive Order 14110 must be reinstated. The very fact that it ’s called “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy 
Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence ” should be the first clue that it’s the better plan.
