General Comment
Hello,
I directly oppose of both OpenAI and Google being allowed to use copyrighted m aterial for generative AI, and I am  against them
dism antling US copyright law so they have free reign of what they can use for their AI program s without any com pensation for the original
creators/copyright holders. Dism antling copyright laws strictly for the purpose of large tech corporations being able to steal from
copyrighted works should not be som ething that can be allowed to happen. Not having our current copyright laws in place will affect
every business in this country, both big and sm all. Enacting this would also affect m illions of Am ericans who create art of every kind that
exists, both independent and even ones who work for large m edia com panies like Disney. Please do not let OpenAI and Google control
our existing laws on copyrighted m aterial. We have these laws in place for a very good reason.
Thank you.
