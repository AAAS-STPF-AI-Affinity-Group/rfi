General Comment
under no circum stances should any AI work be exem pted from  copyright law, since AI com pany's business plans rely on theft of
copyrighted m aterial to build their libraries and generate output. And if that m eans the end of AI then so be it. We didn’t need it before
and we don’t need it now.
