General Comment
Generate AI is anti-hum an trained on stolen labor and creativity of hum an beings. Keep guardrails up and m ake them  pay to profit off
content they had no part in creating. Make it harder to get perm issions and set ethical guidelines around disclosing when and how itâ€™s used
and what m aterials it was trained on. This is not even getting to the environm ental costs related to its use.
