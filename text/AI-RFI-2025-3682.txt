General Comment
AI is trained on artwork effectively stolen from  creators. It is unethical to continue to allow these program s to scrap art, writing, and m ore
without the consent of the original creators. Not only that, but the am ount of water used to cool the servers AI uses is trem endous and
should not be allowed. The planet is low if resources as it is, and using that am ount of water for nothing but cooling m achinery is also
unethical. Please do not grant OpenAI or any other AI program s the ability to legally train on art that does not belong to them .
