General Comment
I am  strongly against this as a sm all business owner. We m ust protect existing copyright law. If we give AI the ability to ignore such laws,
it will harm  Am erican businesses for decades to com e. Sm all businesses will be especially harm ed by the loss of copyright protections. If
AI is such a vital and thriving technology, it should be no issue to pay copyright holders what they are owed.
