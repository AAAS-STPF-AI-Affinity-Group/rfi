General Comment
Do not give the power to ignore copyright law to OpenAI. This would be a devastating blow to creatives and anyone with proprietary
work. If this technology can only grow by stealing from  people, it shouldn't be allowed to exist. Giving OpenAI and other genAI
com panies the freedom  to steal and profit off of other people's work without com pensation is injustice of the highest order.
