To whom it may concern,
The technologies known as "AI" (specifically Generative AI) do grave damage to the
environment, exploit labor throughout the Global South, and steal the work of creativeswithout consent (as well as web content produced by millions of internet users over 20+years). The US should not be developing these tools and should work with global institutionsto institute restrictions on usage.
Sincerely,
