General Comment
I am  appalled that big tech has the gall to use fearm ongering tactics like Chinese xenophobia to push for com pletely destroying our
country's copyright laws, for a product that has not even shown it is anything other than a nuisance. This is a short sighted, greedy
proposal that should not be considered. Dism antling our constitution for the benefit of corporations is a surefire way to erode the very
foundations of our country.
