General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. AI is a bubble waiting to burst and the technology does incredible harm  to the
environm ent through its water usage and energy consum ption. It's bad and this is a bad plan.
