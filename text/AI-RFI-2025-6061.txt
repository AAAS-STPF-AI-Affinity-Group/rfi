General Comment
Passing this bill will destroy any and all copyrighted work and art that is created. Not only that, but these Generative AI program s show
glaring issues such as spreading false inform ation that HAS caused harm  to people, racial and ethnic bias by portraying people of color in
negative ways while white people are portrayed positively, and the servers these program s run off of take up som e m uch energy and
resources just to generate one response. I urge you to not let this bill be passed because it will only cause nothing but harm .
