General Comment
Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) requires the unauthorized use of intellectual property in order to function, because the licensing
fees for all the work that genAI's proponents say is necessary would be an onerous burden. It is not the responsibility of the United States
governm ent to support the theft of intellectual property of tens of thousands of creative workers in order to keep afloat the ill-advised
schem es of a dim inished few. It is a genie that cannot be put back in the bottle. Generative AI should be allowed to fail because it is a
pyram id schem e, and because supporting the econom ic engine of Am erican creative workers will be better for our econom y than letting a
half dozen venture capitalists hoard wealth with a license to steal.
