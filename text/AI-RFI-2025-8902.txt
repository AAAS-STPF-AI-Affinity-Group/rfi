General Comment
allowing the absorbtion of all copywritten content into AI is a threat not just to artists and writers, but newspapers, m agazines, podcasters,
m usic, and m ore. The m ajor export of the United States is its culture, bringing in billions of dollars into the country and allowing m ajor
corportations to grow trem endously. Rupert Murdoch would have no fortune if his business had no copyright protection. Joe Rogan is
vulnerable to this exploitation as his influence withers if he's duplicated a thousand tim es by people with goals to the left of his. Creative
fields would grind to a halt while those overseas overwhelm  our influence by having no such sea of duplicates and phonies to overcom e.
And President Trum p would have no legal recourae to keep people from  using his brand in an unauthorized way. This is a Trojan Horse
of illegality and does not Make Am erica Great. Stop this steal!
