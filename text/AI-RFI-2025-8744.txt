General Comment
Generative AI is built off the constant theft and copyright infringem ent of num erous digital artists who did not give perm ission for their
work to be used in this way, and they have no way to opt out once their art enters the algorithm . To support GenAI at this state is to
dism antle the idea of copyright entirely, rem oving it from  everyday citizens and m aking it a protection only the rich and elite can enjoy.
Supporting GenAI tells your voters that you do not care about them , or their creativity, or their passion, and only the m oney you get from
the wallets of those who want to exploit them . A vote to support GenAI is a vote to lose your elected position at the next opportunity.
