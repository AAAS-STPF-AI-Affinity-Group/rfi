General Comment
I do not believe that AI has a place now, or EVER, a place in the United States!
AI steals from  creators who put their heart and soul into their works, especially as to take from  ones' livelihood as a hard working
Am erican, as well as its only source of profiteering is steal from  others.
AI is a sham , an em pty prom ise and an absolute con that is nothing but a waste of resources and another opportunity to rob from  the
Am erican People!
AI HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES, ESPECIALLY IN ITS GOVERNMENT!
