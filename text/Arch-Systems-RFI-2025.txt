Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
1. Executive Summary  
Arch Systems, LLC is pleased to submit recommendations for developing  a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action 
Plan that aligns with Enterprise Architecture (EA)  principles , promotes cross -agency collaboration, and ensures rapid AI 
adoption while avoiding vendor lock -in and cost escalations through open -source solutions.  
AI has the potential to improve decision -making, automate workflows, and enhance operational efficienc y. However, AI must 
be implemented with agility, governance, and interoperability in mind to ensure scalability, security, and cost -effectiveness. 
This document offers actionable insights into breaking down silos , fostering AI -driven innovation, standardizing AI 
infrastructure, and ensuring  that AI aligns with public sector federal government missions.  Figure 1 illustrates the intelligent 
Human Centered Des ign (iHCD) AI lifecycle management platform.

The Cost -Effectiveness of Small Businesses in AI Innovation  
Small businesses like Arch Systems, LLC, consistently demonstrate that they can deliver high -quality AI solutions more 
efficiently and cost -effectively than larger enterprises. Small businesses are agile, responsive, and driven by innovation, unlike 
large corporations, which often encounter bureaucratic delays, high overhead costs, and rigid processes .  
Over the past year, Arch Systems , LLC has successfully deployed over 20+ AI projects for the Administration for Children 
and Families (ACF)  - a feat that larger businesses typically take years to accomplish. This success aligns with the Department 
of General Effectiveness (DOGE) principles, emphasizing efficiency, adaptability, and mission -driven AI deployment. Our 
lean, highly skilled teams provide  customized AI solutions without unnecessary cost increase s, ensuring that taxpayer dollars 
are u tilized effectively. By leveraging open -source AI frameworks, cross -agency collaboration, and rapid development cycles, 
we deliver  AI solutions that are not only cutting -edge but also fiscally responsible.  
 
For the 2025 FXPElev8 Awardee  - Recognizing High -Performing  Federal Programs , Arch is an Awardee for 2025.

Bio of Alain Briancon  
Dr. Alain C. Briancon  is a distinguished technology executive with over 30 years of leadership  experience as a VP, 
CTO, and CEO across large enterprises, medium -sized businesses, and innovative startups. He holds a Ph.D. and 
M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, both earned with a perfect 5.0 GPA, and a Master’s 
degree from Supelec, Paris, where he graduated as a valedictori an. With an impressive portfolio of 90 patents, including 
29 in AI and machine learning, Alain has spearheaded  innovations that significantly enhanced business performance, 
such as an AI -powered pricing system that managed $350 million  for Kantar Profiles and an AI -based GDP forecasting 
model adopted by the Bank of Canada. His expertise spans AI, big data, IoT, security, and digital transformation, driving str ategic 
initiatives like an AI approach to automotive loan adjudication that boosted volumes by $1 billion  and a churn reduction model for 
Verizon’s 125 million customers. As CTO at Cerebri AI, he led the devel opment of real -time AI -driven platforms that optimized decision -
making and reduced costs for Fortune 500 companies.  Alain’s ability to transform businesses through AI and advanced technologies 
and his strategic leadership and team -building skills make him a recognized authority in leveraging innovation to drive growth and 
operational excellence.  Alain has participated as a reviewer to many NSF SBIR panels . 
2. Aligning AI with Enterprise Architecture (EA)  
To ensure AI integrates seamlessly into federal IT ecosystems, it must align with Enterprise Architecture (EA) principles , 
focusing on interoperability, cost control, security, and scalability . Table 2  describes AI -EA integration strategies.  
Table 2: AI-Enterprise Architecture (EA) Integration Strategies  
AI-EA Integration Strategies  Description  
Open -Source AI Frameworks  Adopt open -source AI models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to prevent vendor lock -in and control 
costs.  
API-Driven AI Architecture  Develop standardized AI APIs to ensure cross -agency interoperability and data integration.  
Hybrid Cloud & Edge AI  Implement scalable AI infrastructure that balances on -premises , edge computing, and cloud AI 
services.  
Microservices for AI  Use containerized AI models (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker) for modular, flexible AI deployments.  
Zero Trust AI Security  Embed security -first principles into AI workflows using federal cybersecurity guidelines (e.g., 
NIST, FedRAMP).  
Aligning AI with EA frameworks ensures that AI deployments remain modular, adaptable, and cost -effective . 
3. Promoting Cross -Agency Collaboration & Removing Silos  
Government agencies often struggle with data silos, duplicative AI initiatives, and lack of interoperability . Arch proposes a 
federated AI collaboration model  that ensures seamless data sharing and interoperability across agencies . Figure 2  illustrates 
key components of AI governance and collaboration.  
Key Recommendations:  By breaking down AI silos, government agencies can accelerate AI adoption while maximizing 
resource utilization.  
 
Figure 2: Key Components of AI Governance and Collaboration  
4. Agility & Rapid AI Adoption: Pilot Programs & AI Platforms  
To mitigate risks and ensure AI is thoroughly tested before full -scale deployment , Arch recommends a "fail fast, learn fast" 
approach  through pilot AI programs and rapid prototyping platforms . Table 3  describes AI acceleration strategies and 
implementation approaches.  
Table 3: AI Acceleration Strategies and Implementation Approaches  
AI Acceleration Strategy  Implementation Approach  
Regulatory AI Sandboxes  Establish AI testing environments with controlled risk exposure for experimental AI 
applications . 
Open -Source AI Pipelines  Leverage open -source AI tools (e.g., MLflow, Hugging Face) to rapidly train, test, and deploy AI 
models.
