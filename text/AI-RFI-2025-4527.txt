General Comment
I do not believe that artificial intelligence will aid in the future of the Am erican people, especially if the guardrails that protects intellectual
property and creative works from  being stolen are rem oved in regards to the training of said artificial intelligence. 
Rem oving these guards incentives and protects theft, especially of Am erican work.
