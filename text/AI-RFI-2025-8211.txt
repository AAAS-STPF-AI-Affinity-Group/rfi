General Comment
This is going to kill art as we know it. We will never recover. Do NOT do this. If stealing from  a store where everything is m ass produced
is a crim e, how is stealing from  creative people who have put years of their own tim e and effort into creating art not??? THIS IS THEFT,
YOU CAN'T ALLOW THIS.
