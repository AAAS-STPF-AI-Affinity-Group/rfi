General Comment
It is absolutely im perative that OpenAI and other com panies who wish to scrape copywritten m aterials be held accountable under the law
for stealing creations they did not properly license with the consent and perm ission of the original creator. They also try to claim  their
business m odel cannot succeed without theft. If they need to steal data to be successful, then they are based on a crim inal act and should
not be allowed to thrive. Additionally, the theft of this data goes beyond just taking som ething as it can then recreate and m im ic the original
creator itself. It presents a block for any new and original content as people are afraid of their likeness and voice being stolen and used
against their will. Generative AI m odels destroy the environm ent and so far have no true groundbreaking use case to justify their
outrageous valuations. Without proper plans in place to protect people, these com panies will ruin countless lives with their AI slop.
