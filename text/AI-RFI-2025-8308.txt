General Comment
Ai generated m edia should be held to m ore scrutiny when it com es to copyright. It has becom e so easy for these m odels to scrape the
web for thousands of articles/im ages/videos/audio files that they are taking from  hundreds of creators at a tim e. Som e people liken
generative ai to creators being inspired by other works, then using that inspiration to help them  create. However, inspiration is a uniquely
hum an process where the creator adds som ething unique to them . If they arenâ€™t being transform ative and they just take, that can be titled
plagiarism  or copyright infringem ent. Generative ai takes, it is incapable of adding anything original. If it can find hundreds of sources to
pull from  to generate m edia, it also needs to be held accountable for accurately and explicitly crediting those sources.
