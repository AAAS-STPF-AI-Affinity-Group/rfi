General Comment
As an Am erican citizen who has studied AI and Machine Learning, from  linear regression to gradient descent, I do not believe AI will
assist with national security, but will harm  it. It has been dem onstrated that it is quite possible to retrieve the training data from  the AI (see
https://blog.gitguardian.com /yes-github-copilot-can-leak-secrets/ for an exam ple). I worry that this rush to integrate AI nationwide will
result in a half-baked technology that is easily exploited.
