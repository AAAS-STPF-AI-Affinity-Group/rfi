General Comment
While I do see a use for AI in certain fields, generative AI seem s only capable of taking jobs, hobbies, and the very hum an experience
from  people. It exists as little m ore than a cash grab for the com pany of it's origin and seem s to offer little to civil, m ilitary, or scientific
fields that couldn't be accom plished by even the m ost pathetically trained person. 
No. The guardrails should rem ain in place.
