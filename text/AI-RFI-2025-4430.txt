General Comment
we are watching so-called "a.i." technology level entire industries in real tim e. the tech is built on illegally harvested data extracted from
copyrighted works. m ake no m istake: this is a crim e. and y'all have kind of just set it loose on the citizens. creators need to be
com pensated for their work (not to m ention lost opportunities) and these tech com panies need to be put on a *leash.*
best wishes!
