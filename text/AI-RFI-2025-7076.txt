General Comment
I’m  a professional artist and m y job is currently threatened by generative AI. AI com panies should not have im punity to break copyright
law. Unfortunately som e of m y art has already been incorporated into the LAION-5 data set which has been used to “train” (copy) AII.
A num ber of the pieces that have been stolen are com m ercial illustrations I have created for large com panies such as Disney, Warner Bros
and m ore, which also infringes on their copyright. Generative AI is just m ass theft that is already costing people their jobs.
