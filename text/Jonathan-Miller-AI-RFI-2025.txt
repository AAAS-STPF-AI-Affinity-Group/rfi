If a business cannot be viable without stealing protected original thought, then it should not be
viable. If the AI industryâ€™s only path to creating viable, competitive products is to train theirLLMs on copyrighted material, without permission, and clearly outside of the definition andspirit of the Free Use Doctrine, the government should not bend the law to the detriment ofcountless copyright holders in order to prop up a technology built on stolen material,especially one that has failed to return even the smallest modicum of value on the tremendousinvestment it has received, and which has also exponentially increased its use of preciousnatural resources to no tangible benefit for anyone except investors artificially inflating thevaluation of this vaporware.
 
DO NOT allow AI companies to tread on copyright holders. If these companies have thepotential for the world-changing economic impact they love to tout to loudly in order to raisefunds, then they can use those funds to properly license the copyrighted works they claim toneed.
