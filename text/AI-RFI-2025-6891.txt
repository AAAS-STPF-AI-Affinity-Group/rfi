General Comment
Hello!
The use of AI is extrem ely problem atic, since its ability is based on copyright theft. It is also frequently wrong, and should not be used as
an expert or the basis for anything beyond sim ple routine checks. It cannot m ake decisions, conduct analysis, or create policy. Plus, as
m entioned above, it depends on stolen intellectual property to do whatever it does. So no to any and all AI beyond sim ple routine checks.
