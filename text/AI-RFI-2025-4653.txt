General Comment
I would likely to form erly state m y total and absolute opposition to the "Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Action plan).
This is in direct opposition to Am erican interests. This hurts the livelihoods of thousands of individuals who earn their incom e through
creating intellectual property. This action plan encourages profit from  theft.
AI is not the future for the US.
