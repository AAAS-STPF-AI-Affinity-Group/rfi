General Comment
Open AI has been proven countless tim es to be stealing copyrighted m aterial to train it's program . It would not only be allowing theft of
products but theft of creative works. Com panies like Open AI have also shown huge net lose over the years with countless investors
keeping these projects afloat each tim e. Usually showing sinking stocks lose and countless rug pulls as well.
It would not just be detrim ental to the governm ent. But the governm ent would end up a giant investm ent schem e into a flim sy program  that
has shown little progress in the past 2 years alone.
