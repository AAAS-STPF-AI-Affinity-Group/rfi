Hello, 
I am taking this opportunity to provide input on the AI Action Plan.  
All AI models should be required to follow existing intellectual property laws and copyright
laws. Allowing them to consume and use copyrighted content created by humans for profit isstealing directly from human content creators like writers, actors, voice actors, singers,musicians, visual artists, photographers, videographers and designers, to name a few.
 
This is not a complex issue. Anything less than honoring copyright will be a blatant disregardfor business ethics, individual rights, and the law.
 
Sincerely,  
Shannon Jay Kennedy
