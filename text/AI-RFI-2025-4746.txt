General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. I believe it is nothing m ore than a gim m ick, a parlor trick. It seem s neat for a
m om ent to som e people but they have no idea it steals from  the livelihoods of others and has a negative im pact on the world. It has a lim it
shelf life and will be forgotten about but the dam age will already be done. AI will be the downfall of m any com panies that chase the latest
toy while stepping on the backs of artists trying to m ake a living. Do not throw away the laws we have just for som ething that will burst.
Do not drown the world with AI. Please do what's right
