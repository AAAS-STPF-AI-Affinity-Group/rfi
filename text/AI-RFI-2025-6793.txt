General Comment
This is som ething we don't need in this world now nor ever. By letting AI into people's work, you're letting it take away their creativity and
hard hard. Not to m ention, letting others com m ent theft of som eone else. I love drawing and I been doing all of m y life, and I refuse to let
this AI BS ruin m y dream  and everything I am  to be a good artist by hand and paper. Preserve and protect hum an generated work
