General Comment
Generative AI is a grift of the highest order, an attem pt by the rich to outsource creativity. It adds nothing to society while actively taking
away from  the Am erican people. If generative AI is allowed to do whatever they want without consequence, not only will Am erican
citizens lose jobs in droves, but the artistic quality of m any of Am erica's "exports" (m ovies, television, video gam es, m usic) are likely to
take a nosedive. Do the world a favor and just say no.
