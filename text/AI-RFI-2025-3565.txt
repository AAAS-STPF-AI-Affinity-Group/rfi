General Comment
AI is horrible, AI job application program s? The right people don't get hired. Generative AI? not only is it Theft, its taking away jobs from
the canadian public which negatively im pacts the job m arket AND the stock m arket, leading to recession if not full depression. AI
exclusively belongs in scientific research where it belongs and not rem oving jobs from  people sim ply because its "cheaper".
