General Comment
AI, for generative use at least, is useless in the long term . Besides killing gig econom y for m any hard working artists, it will fill the internet
and inform ation super highways (and it already has) with m isinform ed useless slop. People are already using it for papers. AI needs to be
stopped entirely, not furthered.
