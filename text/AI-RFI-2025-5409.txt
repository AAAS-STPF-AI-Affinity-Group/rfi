General Comment
Allowing any am ount of leniency in fair use for the developm ent of what is well understood to be a poor assem bly of random  data will be
a disaster for the arts, education of the arts and of all other subjects, com m on knowledge, and the rule of law. Nothing less than our
current understanding of reality is at stake with the m aintenance of copyright and protection of our creators.
