General Comment
I am  absolutely opposed to the idea of allowing AI developers to have unlim ited access to the use of copyrighted m aterials in the training
of their m odels.
The Fair Use doctrine allows for the use of copyrighted m aterials in other works that are transform ative, to criticise or com m ent, or
advance the progress of the arts by the additional of som ething new to the copyrighted work. AI training achieves none of these goals.
Scraping existing works to train an autom ated system  is likely to have the exact opposite effects the Fair Use doctrine was instituted to
obtain. AI does not create, it m erely copies and rem ixes. This is not the sam e as the use of reference and practice to create to new works.
By its nature it cannot com m ent or criticize. It can only regurgitate others opinions. 
Increase of AI tools is likely to m ake it extraordinarily difficult for artists and writers who rely on com m ercial com m issions to m aintain a
livelihood. The work of an artist is their property. AI proposes to create tools to profit com m ercially from  replacing the work of artists and
writers. We should not be allowing the theft of the property of both our own citizens and writers worldwide in order to fuel profits to a
corporation. It is the responsibility of governm ent to protect the rights of individual citizens.
