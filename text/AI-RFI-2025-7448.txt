General Comment
Generative AI technology is a trend and a toy and has no future. It will do nothing but dull the m inds of the youth, take jobs from  working
Am ericans, and m ake our country the laughingstock of the world. Generative AI is useless and cheap and worth nothing com pared to the
artists from  which it steals.
