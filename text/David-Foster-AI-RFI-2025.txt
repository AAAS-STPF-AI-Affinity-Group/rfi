Laws for Training Data
AI models require massive datasets to function, but unauthorized scraping of  
copyrighted works has led to legal disputes. Content creators fear losing control over  
their work, while AI developers argue that training data is essential for progress. Current  
copyright laws were not designed for AI, creating legal uncertainty that primarily  
benefits Big Tech with legal teams .
Proposed Solutions:
·Expand fair use protections  to allow AI models to train on data at least 10
years old (or a similar threshold). This balances the needs of content creators
and AI developers, ensuring older works can contribute to innovation without
harming recent creators.
·Encourage licensing agreements  while requiring medium and large
businesses  to fully disclose  their training materials. This minimizes legal
disputes and ensures a fair competitive environment .
·Government-funded materials , especially scientific research and publicly
funded datasets, should be immediately and freely available, even if originally
behind a paywall.
·Enforce explicit disclosure requirements  for companies training models on
non-public data , ensuring transparency in AI development.
·Establish penalties for violations , ensuring companies cannot train models
on copyrighted, non-fair-use material  without consequences.
Preventing AI from Concentrating Power in Capital
AI has the potential to consolidate wealth and power , disproportionately benefiting
capital over labor . This is the greatest risk of AI . To counter this, legislation must
prioritize individuals and small businesses , ensuring AI remains a tool for broad
innovation, not just corporate monopolies .
Open-source AI is crucial—while it benefits large corporations, for small businesses


and individuals, it determines whether they can innovate or remain dependent on
tech giants . Without truly open models, small enterprises are forced into expensive
cloud AI services, where access, pricing, and innovation are dictated by a fewdominant companies .
Proposed Solutions:
·Legally define what qualifies as "open-source AI." Should this include just
model weights and code , or also training data and methodologies ? A clear
legal framework prevents corporations from exploiting vague definitions.
·Strengthen and enforce anti-monopoly laws , preventing Big Tech from using
licensing loopholes  (e.g., Meta's “open weights but closed license” model) to
block competition.
·Require that AI models developed with government funds  (e.g., university
research or public-sector projects) be fully open-source , including weights,
training data, and methodologies .
·Fund independent open-source AI projects  (such as Hugging Face’s
BLOOM, EleutherAI, and Mistral) to foster competition and decentralization .
·Provide tax incentives  for businesses contributing to open-source AI, similar
to existing open-source software tax credits .
AI Education & Workforce Development
To rapidly upskill the workforce , the focus should be on short-term, high-impact AI
training programs  rather than traditional long-degree programs.
Proposed Solutions:
Expand Title IV eligibility  to cover short-term AI programs , including coding boot
camps and online AI certifications.
Permit more flexible accreditation models  for industry-recognized AI and tech
certifications , ensuring high-quality programs without unnecessary bureaucratic
barriers. Set minimum standards  to protect students from predatory, low-value
programs.
Allow businesses to directly fund AI education  through job placement
agreements , ensuring students graduate with employment opportunities.
Extend federal Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans  to include certificate
programs , preventing students from being burdened with high loan payments after
short-term AI training.
Provide federal and state grants for in-demand AI certificate programs , similar
to existing workforce development grants for skilled trades .
Expand Pell Grants  to include short-term AI training courses .
Reduce credit barriers for AI education loans , making funding accessible to a
wider range of students.
Expand loan eligibility  to cover very short courses (as short as 4 weeks) to allow
for fast AI upskilling.


Encourage businesses to create AI apprenticeships , where students can train in
AI-related fields with guaranteed employment pipelines .
Establish retraining programs  for workers displaced by AI, particularly blue-
collar workers  (e.g., truck drivers replaced by self-driving technology).
Nuclear Energy & AI Power Demands
AI requires massive amounts of energy, and demand will only increase. The current
regulatory framework for nuclear energy is outdated , making it nearly impossible  to
bring new nuclear power plants online within a reasonable timeframe. Without reform,AI's power demands will strain the grid , leading to higher costs and slower AI
adoption .
Proposed Solutions:
Streamline the approval process for new nuclear reactors.  Currently, it takes
10+ years to approve and construct new reactors. Bureaucratic delays should be
reduced while maintaining rational safety standards .
Fast-track advanced nuclear technologies such as molten salt reactors, smallmodular reactors (SMRs), and thorium-based reactors . These technologies are
safer and more efficient  than traditional nuclear designs.
Limit local overreach and NIMBYism. Even if federal approvals are streamlined,local governments can still block nuclear projects , leading to unnecessary
delays.
Encourage private investment in nuclear power , removing unnecessary
financial and regulatory barriers. AI companies should be allowed to develop
their own dedicated power sources .
Permit AI data centers to build and operate their own nuclear power plants ,
ensuring stable, independent power sources  for AI clusters.
Upgrade aging electrical grids to accommodate AI-driven power demand.Many regions cannot currently handle  the increased load from new AI-focused
data centers without significant infrastructure investment .
