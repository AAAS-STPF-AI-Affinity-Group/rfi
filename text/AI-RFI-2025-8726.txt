General Comment
Absolutely do not grant com panies to train AI on intellectual property it did not pay for. Force AI com panies to pay for the licenses of
intellectual property if it wants to use that data for training. Text, im ages, video needs to be licensed. Com panies are required BY LAW to
respect copyright, and this AI training is no different.
