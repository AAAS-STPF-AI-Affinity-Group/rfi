General Comment
I have very little hope that anything the public says will sway the governm ent on this m atter, given that every decision this adm inistration
m akes appears to be bad by design. That being said, I want to add m y voice to the throng requesting that you do not allow AI com panies
to have full use of any copyrighted work they choose to feed into their LLMs. It is outrageous that this even needs to be begged for,
because in no other sector would such blatant copyright infringem ent be allowed.
