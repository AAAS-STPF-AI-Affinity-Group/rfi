General Comment
Hello! I am  writing today to say that it is unconstitutional to allow generative AI com panies to train their AI on content they don't own. I
believe that AI puts individual liberty at risk, and therefore the future of Am erican prosperity depends on strictly regulating AI technology.
Generative AI is nothing m ore than an am algam ation of stolen works from  various types of m edia (online, print, im ages, artwork,
photographs), etc. If you were to rem ove these ethical guardrails, it creates a dangerous precedent and opens the door for nefarious
foreign actors or enem y governm ents to create m isinform ation. How is that constitutional? Aside from  the intellectual property theft, there
are several risks that generative AI has for our country.
There is also a m atter of clim ate change. I would like to point to this article to show AI's growing carbon footprint:

Thank you for reading. Once again, I urge you to not give com panies perm ission to train AI on content that does not belong to them .
