General Comment

* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
No entity, whether an individual, com pany, corporation, or beyond should have the ability to use copyrighted m aterial with im m unity.
People who create content that is copyrighted should be paid for their work and their efforts. It would lead to terrible abuse which defeats
the purpose that copyrights were created for in the first place.
