General Comment
Any plan for dom inance in AI m ust have a m ajor consideration for the accessibility and quality of data to be used. The National Academ y
of Sciences has two groups that focus on data: US National Com m ittee for CODATA which has strong international access and the
Board on Research Data and Inform ation. It is recom m ended that these groups be included in discussions on national AI policy and the
im portance of quality, FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reuseable -https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data. Other
countries around the world including European and China are far ahead of us in advancing data curation.
