General Comment
While I don't fervently hate or AI, I believe that those deeply affected by this should have the right to protest and oppose the usage of AI
taking advantage of their art without perm ission. I also believe Trum p's appeals to "The Good of this Nation" are blatant attem pts to
enforce nationalist m indsets that allow him  to get away with ever increasing bigotry.
