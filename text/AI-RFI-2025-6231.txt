General Comment
This is giving corporate exem ption from  copyright law. Let's say you let Disney do som ething sim ilar. They could just steal from  any
sm aller artist or writer and m ake m ass produced garbage with it. Had an original idea for a m ovie? You're never gonna m ake a dim e off it.
Or a gam ing com pany like Ubisoft. Had a good idea and m ade an indie dem o with Godot or som ething? It's going to be stolen. Not that
they don't already steal things, or use AI, but I'm  m aking a point.
