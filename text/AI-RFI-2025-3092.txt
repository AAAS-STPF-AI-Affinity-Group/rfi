General Comment
I do not believe AI has a future for Am erica. It will take away the livehoods of m illions of Am ericans, and will likely result in enabling
foreign actors to scrape Am erican copyrighted works from  all m anner of Am erican com panies who cannot afford getting their works
stolen by a program  that does nothing of im portant.
