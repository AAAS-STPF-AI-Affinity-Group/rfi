General Comment
Generative AI steals from  citizens in order to profit. We should not legitim ize the ability for com panies to steal art, m usic, writing, or
anything we create to train a vague sim ulacrum  for plagiarism . This will only serve to benefit those in tech that are trying to profit off of the
backs of artists without acknowledging or crediting the work they steal in any ways.
