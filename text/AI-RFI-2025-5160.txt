General Comment
Please allow copyright protections to extend to AI training. I am  an artist and m y work is being used to train AI. I would like to have
protection against this, but current copyright laws are unclear on this m atter. This m akes it im possible to know what I can legally do in this
situation. A copyright m odel which requires copyright holders to consent in order for their data to be used, before an AI could be trained
on it, would help to legally establish protections for m yself, and other artists, from  AI currently, and in the future.
