General Comment
Dear NITRD/NCO/NSF,
I am  very concerned that in the scram ble for global dom inance, the United States will allow an excessively lax regulatory environm ent for
AI safety and Am erican com panies will build AIs with dangerous capabilities that will harm  everyone in the world, including Am ericans.
I would strongly urge you to enforce strict controls on AI to m ake sure AI com panies cannot develop anything that m ight be dangerous.
Thank you,
Michael Dickens
