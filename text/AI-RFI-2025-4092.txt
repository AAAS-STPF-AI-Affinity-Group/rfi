General Comment
The developm ent of artificial intelligence in its current incarnation (large language m odels) is both untenable and im m oral. To continue to
allow m assive for profit corporations to steal the work of others to generate profit for them selves at the expense of every citizen just
because they use the infrastructure created in part by their tax dollars is horrifying.
This will not even spur innovation, as has been seen with Chinese com panies able to produce com parable m odels with less effective
hardware and less access to such works. Allowing this practice to continue will only cem ent the idea that AI com panies do not need to
innovate in order to succeed. Instead it will show them  that they can sim ply rely on the work of others to m ake them  appear profitable to
their investors, while other countries surpass us.
