General Comment
Copyright needs to be protected and AI use and developm ent needs to be done ethically and in a way that accounts for and elim inates
bias. AI has been overhyped and is unable to deliver on its prom ises. Giving OpenAI protection from  copyright infringem ent is theft and
will harm  the livelihoods of countless Am ericans. This will harm  genuine creation and innovation, and will further dam age the reputation of
the US.
