General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft and the
destruction of the lives of creatives. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
AI should be deeply regulated and heavily contained as to protect the lives and interests of all Am ericans.
