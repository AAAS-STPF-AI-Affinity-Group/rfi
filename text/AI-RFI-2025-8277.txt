General Comment
Definitely not! People's own thoughts and ideas should belong to them , not to som e faceless corporation that wants to m ash it up and pass
it off as som e one-dim ensional im itation of som ething new. Com puters cannot generate new m aterial, they can only copy the patterns and
probabilities of what they already know.
