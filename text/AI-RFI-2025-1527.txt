General Comment
I am  a open source developer who rely on AI . And we largely rely on open source AI m odels. The knowledge should be accessible by
everyone to build greater things for our future generations . Anti-com petitive behavior by Big Tech in the AI sector poses significant
challenges to fair com petition, innovation, and ethical AI developm ent. 
By controlling proprietary AI m odels, fram eworks, and cloud infrastructure, Big Tech can lock users into their ecosystem s, m aking it
difficult for com petitors to gain traction.
Now is the tim e to m ake it accessible for everyone . 
Thank you !
