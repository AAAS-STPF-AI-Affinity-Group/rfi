General Comment
Generative AI relies on m ass theft to be trained, and requires unconscionable am ounts of resources to function. It provides bad
inform ation and m akes bad art (when it is not unpredictably sim ply recreating art from  its training set), and doesn't exist to do better.
Rather, it exists to strip em ploym ent from  hum ans who are perceived to cost m ore.
It is overhyped the sam e way NFTs were largely by the sam e people, and is just as useful. The scam  involved is less obvious but no less
unpleasant.
