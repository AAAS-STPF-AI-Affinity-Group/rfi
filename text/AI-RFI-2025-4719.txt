General Comment
As an individual that works in the AI Industry, I believe that AI should be regulated as a m atter of national security. 
Allowing individual com panies the lee-way to arbitrarily decide what to train AI on, without any input from  the individuals or com panies
that control the content being trained on, opens the door to anyone stealing Am erican secrets under the guise of "training data."
No legitim ate com pany should be pressuring the Am erican public to allow their identities, private inform ation, and other sensitive
inform ation to be used in their training data.
TRAINING DATA IS NOT PRIVATE AND CAN BE REVERSE ENGINEERED. IT IS A MATTER OF NATION SECURITY
THAT THE COMPANIES PROVE THEIR DATA CAN NOT BE REVERSE ENGINEERED BEFORE ALLOWING THEM TO
ADD TO IT.
