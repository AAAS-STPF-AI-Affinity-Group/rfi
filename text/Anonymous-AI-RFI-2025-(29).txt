I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High School. I completed a 
semester course on AI and Ethics and studied the impacts of Generative AI on the NBA. E.O. 14179 would be more negative than positive on this, and policy about competition should be based on the core human aspect of the NBA. AI should be able to have a slight impact on the NBA, considering the highlights of a player, but should never be able to fully transfer over to the actual game. The competitive aspect of the NBA is what makes it so enjoyable to watch, and putting a larger emphasis on AI today could take away from the game. While AI has heavily influenced many other aspects of our world, it should always be essential to keep the human aspects of all sports. Even considering this, it is still something that could be used around the NBA, maybe to keep stats, since that wouldn’t take away from what the NBA and other sports offer. Overall, competitiveness shouldn’t necessarily be influenced by AI as much as other topics on the list. Sports are separate compared to the other topics in this world and should primarily remain separate.
