General Comment
Com m ercial AI products, such as text, im age, and video generators are a transparent attem pt to steal jobs from  hard-working Am erican
citizens. By consolidating the incom e that would be going to m any workers, such as professional artists, accountants, and designers into a
sm all set of com panies who have fewer em ployees will only further stagnate the econom y. These people buy groceries and gas here on
Am erican soil. The com panies don't. Most of the em ployees and infrastructure these com panies do have is outsourced to foreign countries
(including China). The server equipm ent and labor are cheaper there and there's no hope of catching up in a tim ely m anner. The AI
industry will bleed Am erican dollars that would otherwise be circulated dom estically out into global m arkets. Allowing these bloodsucking
bastards to keep opperating unchecked on Am erican soil isn't putting Am erica first.
