General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica. Neither to its private citizens, nor its public com panies. AI com panies seek to
subvert the copyright rights of a variety different com panies in industries such as advertisem ent and entertainm ent. This isn’t even taking
into account the rights of private artistic citizens and their own work which AI use unlawfully to create its own ‘artwork’.
