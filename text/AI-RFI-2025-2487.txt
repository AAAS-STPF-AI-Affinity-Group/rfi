General Comment
I am  a freelance illustrator, sm all business owner, and am erican citizen. Without clear and transparent control over m y intellectual
property, work and inform ation, m y ability to continue m y business is in jeopardy.
By granting any group free reign over things that, in every single other context, are considered m y property is unethical and unnecessary.
Without any protections in place we indanger sm all business owners, average am ericans and national security. 
I cannot, with clear conscience, support the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan
