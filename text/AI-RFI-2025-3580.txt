General Comment
Allowing AI to go unregulated is reprehensible and extraordinarily short-sighted. It's not just m orally wrong, but unsustainable to build an
industry on the back of stealing from  the sam e hard-working talent being driven out of it. You can give a m an a fish, teach a m an to fish,
but living on fish stolen from  the fisherm an just leads to everyone starving.
