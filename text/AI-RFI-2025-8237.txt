General Comment
Privately held AI com panies with proprietary m odels should not be allowed to steal copyrighted data for training. This is wholesale theft
for profit and utterly im m oral. Everyone else is legally bound to respect copyright, AI com panies should be as well. Any AI m odels that
result from  stolen data sets should be public dom ain.
