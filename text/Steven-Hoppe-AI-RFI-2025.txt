I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. It steals from my livelihood. I do not
want my hard work used as a means to train a system that takes away creativity. IESPECIALLY do not want my hard work used as a means to train a system that takes awaycreativity, and NOT get paid for it, That is theft. AI steals from my livelihood as an Americanand profits off of theft. That is NOT okay, AI is overrated. It takes away from creativity andoriginality. It is a danger to creative careers. It increases the possibilty of fraud, identity theft.It can take from my artwork and someone coding the AI, could claim to be me. That is not fairor equal to me, That can ruin my livelihood. AI is Fleecing the eyes of the American public.
