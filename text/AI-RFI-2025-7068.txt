General Comment
Hi. 
Generative AI is a m assive burden on the energy sector, which this adm inistration has claim ed to already be over-burdened (it isn't). So
why, pray tell, would you add m ore energy centers, waste m ore water, and waste m ore fuel on som ething that will only flood the m edia
with junk, slop, and garbage. 
AI has incredible potential for uses in the m edical field, in forensic science, for autom ating m ass transportation, and so m uch m ore. Why
focus on rem oving barriers for program s that are already churning out m isinform ation, deep fakes, and just... ugly, useless, soulless, and
com pletely non-creative trash. 
OpenAI, DeepSeek, Chat GPT, etc. are all built on work that has been stolen from  real hum an beings who deserve to be paid fairly and
have their work used correctly. 
This is one of the dum best things y'all have been pushing, and that's saying a lot.
