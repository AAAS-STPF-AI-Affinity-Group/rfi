General Comment
The intended use of these tools is to steal the livelihood Am ericans to profit off of the labor they perform  via theft of their intellectual
property.
Do not allow big tech billionaires to force Am ericans into poverty by destroying their jobs in favor of hallucinated output by com puter
program s that don't know what they're doing and don't care why it's being done.
AI cannot replace hum an beings in the workplace because it is a fundam entally flawed big tech boondoggle that requires fraud and theft to
generate nothing but m ore fraud and theft.
