General Comment
Innovating with AI through unethically stolen im ages from  creators is just not right. The "Don't ask for perm ission, ask for forgiveness"
approach to the sciences of AI coats the field in a business first, hum ans last type of grim e. Solutions to the problem  would be to have
copyright system s in check, to give power to the people who have had their work stolen. Another solution would be to have creators
subm it their works voluntarily and have them  com pensated. The ram pant disregard of hum an ethics that AI currently has paints the field in
a terrible visage. It's disgusting to see and I wish things would get better for people first.
