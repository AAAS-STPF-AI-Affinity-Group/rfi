General Comment
I oppose the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. I oppose all copyright exceptions for AI m odels. I believe that they should have to fairly
and legally license any data used with the consent of the owner, and in the case of people, with the consent of anyone whose likeness is
depicted in trainable data.
