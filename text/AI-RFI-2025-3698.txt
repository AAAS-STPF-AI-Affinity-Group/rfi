General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. Hum an intelligence is superior, and we do not benefit from  trying to create what
isn’t needed. 
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft; anything that has been scraped from  the internet has been done so
without consent or com pensation to the affected parties. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public; why do we need
som ething that can only “create” (and I use that term  loosely) by being prom pted by a hum an anyway? Hum ans should prom pt other
hum ans to do work for them , not use a m achine that is based off plagiarism . 
It is sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, both of which m ake huge prom ises to investors but don’t actually grant any proper returns on
investm ent. 
There are also concerns about the safety of our data; we have already seen the private inform ation and photos of individuals being
lawlessly scraped and used to train AI servers in horrendous ways.
