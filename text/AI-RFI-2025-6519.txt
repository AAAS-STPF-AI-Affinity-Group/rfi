General Comment
AIs are not true artificial intelligence they are language learning m odels. LLMs are not sufficiently advanced enough to handle policy and
security for hum an beings. We should not be relying on LLMs to do actual hum an jobs. This is yet another m ove by the Trum p
adm inistration to elim inate jobs at the expense of Am erican citizens' safety and security.
