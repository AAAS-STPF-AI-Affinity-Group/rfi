General Comment
I do not believe generative AI m achines, such as MidJourney or ChatGPT, hold a place in the future of Am erica. AI "learning" is founded
on the theft of hum an works, and I cannot abide by it. Moreover, generative AI produces results that are at best soulless, redundant and
at worst m isleading, dangerous. I do not support this plan in the slightest.
