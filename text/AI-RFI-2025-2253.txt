General Comment
I am  strongly against the AI executive order. I think AI is taking advantage of the hard work others do and has no right to copy,
plagiarize, or otherwise use people’s work without perm ission, com pensation, and credit. 
AI should not have free rein or special treatm ent. I am  against Trum p’s plan.
