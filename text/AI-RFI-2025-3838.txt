General Comment
Hey, how bout not letting peoples work be stolen for what is already a failing technology by corporations to cut out working folk and try
to profit off cheap labor, there is a place for AI in the would but i think first, only institutions or even people qualified in tech like
program m ing and other types of coding should be the ones using it, two that any and all voice actors will be paid for theyre likness and
voices even being used and three to never have to use it to Illegally scrape archives of artists who them selves are just trying to m ake ends
m eet m ost the tim e. and look the ai of am erica is just to bad, bloated, and SO inefficient and unprofitable any way, China cooked them
and i predict will repeatedly keep cooking them  on this in every aspect, from  financial to even having ethics with that. So for god sake stop
thinking itll be like nft's crypto or whatever new scam  it is, it will always never benefit even those actively trying to use it for scam m ing. i
m ean look how hard they have to fight to literally STEAL work from  so m any artists of all kinds, if it was ok in the first place this wouldnt
be happening now would it.
