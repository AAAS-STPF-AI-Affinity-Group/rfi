HI,
As a psychologist who deals with protected health information, I am deeply concerned about  
the use of AI note taking services or AI recordings of sessions, due to the risk of this  
information being hacked and released in some capacity or used as a form of blackmail. I am  
further concerned about the use of AI mental health chat bots and these risks. 
Thank you for hearing me out.
