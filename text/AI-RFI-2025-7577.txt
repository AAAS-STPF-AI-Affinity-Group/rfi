General Comment
I am  a writer. I have published a best-selling book, viral articles on m ultiple sites, and unbelievable num bers of words on blogs. I have
spent literal decades honing m y craft, so m any hours working so hard for very little m oney.
But I have m ade m oney from  m y writing — not enough, but enough to get by, to pay for m y apartm ent, to go on vacations, even to put a
little aside. I have been able to do this work because I'm  good at what I do, and I'm  good at what I do because I have spent thousands of
hours working on m y writing.
MLM and AI wants to steal m y work. The m akers of these m odels say that their business can't be profitable without stealing m y work.
They say that if they can't run ram pant through m y work — and the work of m any artists such as m yself — their business isn't sustainable.
Good. They should fail. Stealing copyrighted m aterial is illegal. It's im m oral. And it's taking food off m y table. It's profiting from  m y work,
and it's m aking the world poorer in the process.
If MLM and AI can't do what they do without stealing work, they should fail. The end. It's im m oral, it's wrong, it's harm ful, and it m ust
stop.
