General Comment
Generative AI has no long-term  value to the United States and allowing AI developers to have carte blanche to use copyrighted works
nullifies the purpose of copyright to begin with. There will be no value in copyrighting anything when som eone can sim ply instruct an AI to
m ake a perfect copy of som ething if this technology is unregulated. Multi-billion creative dollar industries that are the core of our econom y
would be irrevocably dam aged both nationally and internationally, as Am erican creative works are enjoyed around the world.
Generative AI being harder to create because of Copyright is, in effect, Copyright working as intended. If there is truly som ething useful to
be gained by developing these generative AI it can be done without infringing on the creative works of The United States of Am erica.
