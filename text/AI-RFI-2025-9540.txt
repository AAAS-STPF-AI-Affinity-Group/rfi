General Comment
If AI requires theft to be usable, then it doesn’t deserve to be usable. It’s garbage tech that doesn’t m eaningfully help anyone except
sim pletons and the people profiting off of them . 
The US doesn’t need to give open AI carte Blanche to steal from  artists in order to get ahead. Generative AI is a useless grift that will
only serve to further widen the gap between rich and poor. Nobody wants this crap
