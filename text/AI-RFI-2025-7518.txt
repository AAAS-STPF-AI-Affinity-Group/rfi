General Comment
Do NOT allow OpenAI to steal from  creatives around the world. This is a disastrous discission for artists, writers, and everyone who
wants to create anything. Peoples' livelihoods depend on what they m ake, and allowing AI to steal from  them  with im punity would destroy
everything they've built. It would also discourage future creatives from  pursuing their am bitions.
Please do NOT allow this to continue.
