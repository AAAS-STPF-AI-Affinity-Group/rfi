General Comment
As an architect who has utilized artificial intelligence program s and seen their application in the workplace, I am  deeply troubled by
allowing artificial intelligence com panies to operate through the gutting of copyright protections. Without the stolen work of others, artificial
intelligence can sim ply not operate and AI com panies have continued to refuse to play by the sam e rules that hum an artists and creatives
have for the past century. Additionally, allowing artificial intelligence to operate unim peded will risk thousands of Am erican workers losing
their jobs and will allow large corporations to utilize content from  the internet that is often poorly fact-checked and im properly cited. The
US is known for its cultural exports and with a country loosening its copyright protections for the sake of “artificial intelligence
advancem ent,” we will find our creative works failing to resonate with dom estic and international audiences who yearn for the handm ade,
the raw, and the hum an. Work generated by artificial intelligence is not creative, it is derivative, and in order to be a world leader in the
21st Century, the United States needs to focus on Am erican-m ade ideas and innovations, not those churned out by a com puter that is
regurgitated from  previous ideas. If President Trum p wants to prom ote hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness, and national
security, he will protect the copyright system  in place and encourage the Am erican people to think for them selves and not allow tech
com panies to control the inform ation in this country.
