General Comment
Please do NOT allow AI com panies to have any greater access to training data, copyrighted or otherwise. I do not believe AI holds a
place in the future of the US. It is overhyped by tech CEOs who know it cannot deliver on their prom ises, and they are fleecing the
Am erican public. AI hurts artists and creators, and this will m ake it worse.
