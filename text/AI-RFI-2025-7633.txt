General Comment
This action plan will do nothing but derail the governm ent from  taking action against issues that m atter. The action plan will allow greedy
corporations to steal without consequence, steal from  the people & the governm ent.
This is an extrem e violation of privacy, for individuals, sm all businesses, corporations, & the US governm ent. It will not help 'secure AI
dom inance.'
I wholeheartedly do not support this plan; all it will secure is the idea that the com m on citizen does not have the right to own what they
post online, that their privacy is worthless in the fruitless pursuit of the AI fad.
