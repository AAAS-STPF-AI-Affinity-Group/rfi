General Comment
It is m y belief that AI being trained specifically on the work of hum ans hurts those hum ans. It puts their work and expertise in jeopardy
and they should have to consent and be com pensated for their work being used to train AI m odels. It is deeply unethical to take the
works published by people for free without consent to train an AI.
