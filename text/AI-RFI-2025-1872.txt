General Comment
I do not think it's a good idea to allow the further developm ent of generative AI, or to allow it to eat up jobs that are better done by
hum ans and do not need to be done by a very new and uncertain technology. AI technology is also a heavy environm ental burden, using
up water that the Am erican people need. The spread of AI "photos" that appear real is already creating widespread m isinform ation and
causing people to have a distorted view of reality, and generative AI is being used to create realistic pornographic im ages of non-
consenting individuals, including children. And, as an artist, I am  staunchly against AI generated im ages and writing of any kind, which can
only be created by stealing work from  10s of 1000s of artists and writers. Generative AI is not particularly useful or necessary, especially
when the things it does are things that people enjoy doing and do m uch better than AI could ever do, and it hurts every person who is not
a billionaire by subsum ing jobs that should be held by hum ans.
