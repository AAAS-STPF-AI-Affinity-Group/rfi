General Comment
AI com panies should be held to the sam e copyright and intellectual property standards as any individual. It is not okay for them  to train
m odels on copyrighted content. It is not okay for them  to steal from  artists and then take the jobs from  the very artists whose work
provided the training m aterial, without their consent. AI is nothing less than a m assive grift. It will not benefit the Am erican people in any
way, and OpenAI should be held legally liable for the dam age they have already done.
