General Comment
This action plan is a disaster that's either waiting or dem anding to im plode on itself, as it will m ake creatives like us hum ans suffer. We
can't afford--literally and figuratively--to suffer through anym ore AI's restless consum ption of creative integrity. Even if it isn't in the nam e
of artists, this plan should be tossed in the trash bin because we do not want m isinform ation and needless "slop" to affect education,
creativity, businesses, etc. Not a single word of that plan shall com e through, and the higher-ups know it shouldn't either. We cannot let
this pass.
