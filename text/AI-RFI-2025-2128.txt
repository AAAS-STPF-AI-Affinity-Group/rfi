General Comment
Why are we reducing great m inds and am azing skill to training fodder? Should we not instead be rising above what is a glorified algorithm
and instead funding and fueling the next generation of creatives? If our leaders fear China pulling ahead in AI training m odels so m uch that
they're willing to gut and betray entire industries and m illions of individuals, why not beef up our own m aterial security and ensure that our
rights don't get swallowed up by foreign AND dom estic forces?
It's sad, pathetic, and cowardly that the US is even considering som ething as sham eful as catering to 1-2 com panies over the voices and
rights of m illions.
