General Comment
Generative AI is theft. Generative AI is plagiarism . Generative AI steals from  Am ericans of all kinds who create and teach us things of
great value. It pollutes our digital environm ent, facilitates the spread of inaccurate if not downright incorrect inform ation, and harm s our
real environm ent to an extrem e degree with its dem ands on our energy resources. Generative AI should hold no part in the future of the
United States.
