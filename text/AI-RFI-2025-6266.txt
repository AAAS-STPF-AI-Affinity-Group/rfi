General Comment
This is absurd and ridiculous to even consider m oving forward, besides having nothing to do with national security. All this aim s to do is try
to allow com panies which have been hem orrhaging obscene am ounts of m oney to sim ply steal anything and everything they can scrape for
a novel technology with no real applications. The widescale backlash of public opinion on these increasingly intrusive "A.I." technologies
alone is abysm al, not to m ention the absurd strain it puts on power grids, the dangers to the environm ent and strain on precious natural
resources. All you'd be doing is enabling theft and giving protection to those who cannot be trusted with any inform ation they'd try to glean
from  it. Do not give these short-sighted grifters anything, let them  eat their losses for their terrible ideas and let them  m ake their own
creations instead of stealing and poorly synthesizing the hard work of m illions of others.
