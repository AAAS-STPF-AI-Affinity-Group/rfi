General Comment
The work of artists m ust be protected by copyright against AI. Copyright protects the incentive to create and allows sm all businesses to
m ake a living without having their work stolen. Anti com petitive nature from  big tech with AI is against Am erican values, as is the behavior
of com panies such as Google using AI to censor publishers it disagrees with.
