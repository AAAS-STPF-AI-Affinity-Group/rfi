General Comment
Not only from  a hum an standpoint, the current use of generative AI is directly counter-intuitive to SAVING on energy consum ption. It
costs significantly m ore energy-wise to use it than to "poison the well" via m ethods such as Nightshade and Glaze. Even without taking
energy consum ption into account, using hum an works WITHOUT PERMISSION in order to train generative AI m odels severely
discounts the hum ans that m ade the initial works in the first place. GenAI wouldn't BE where it is without the HUMAN artists they
STOLE from .
Generative AI is redundant. It is not beautiful. It has no soul; it is hollow, and it will not be valued as long as it is UNETHICALLY
INHUMAN.
