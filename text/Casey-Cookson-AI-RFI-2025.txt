Creatives went into their fields with an agreement from the government in place; their work
will belong to them until they sold the rights to their labor to specific parties and underspecific arrangements that they are able to refuse. It's the basic premise of labor. Copyrightexists to incentives creatives to create, its base purpose is to ensure we are not competing withour own work in the marketplace. Generative AI uses our work to compete with us directly.Allowing it to do so will not just harm creatives it will harm ai itself, more creatives will notbe able to continue working and ai has to sustain itself by constantly ingesting new humanmade works. This will lead to a total collapse of the United States creatives industry; thatemploys a staggering amount of Americans and is one of our chief exports. 
It's not simply immoral it's a terrible business decision. Casey Cookson
