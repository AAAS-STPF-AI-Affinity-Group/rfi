General Comment
If Am erica decides to prioritize the use of unlicensed work as training data for these big AI tech firm s it risks losing the very thing that
m akes it unique and profitable... If working artists are unable to contribute m eaningfully and m ake a living there will no longer be incentive
for one of our biggest exports (entertainm ent in all form s m usic, m ovies, gam es...books... ect). Generative AI is largely proving to be
unprofitable and far too expensive to m aintain at the rate that these com panies wish to m aintain. In the end everyone loses out if they are
able to skirt that law and destroy other industry and livelihoods in the process. These big business are racing to the bottom  for a
technology that is largely useless to m ost people, they put on flashy displays but in the last three years generative ai hasn't really
revolutionized any business if anything it has m uddied things up for m any people often m aking things m ore com plicated than it needs to be
by adding an autom ated elem ent that doesn't work well and frustrates m ore than helps. 
If Am erica wants to keep its com petitive edge it needs to uphold copyright so that working people can m aintain their livelihoods and
continue to contribute to society. Don't allow these com panies to pull a fast one while they line their pockets and prom ise im possibilities.
