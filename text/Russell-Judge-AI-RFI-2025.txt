As a software developer, I believe I may have some insight to provide to the AI Action Plan,  
but it occurs to me that there may be a much better source--AI itself.
So, I submitted the area under "Supplementary Information" on the Federal Register  website 
to Grok 3 for a response.  Below is the detail of its response.
Sincerely,
Russell Judge
Below are my comments on the highest priority policy actions that should be included in the  
AI Action Plan under Executive Order 14179, signed by President Trump on January 23,  
2025. These recommendations aim to advance America’s leadership in artificial intelligence  
(AI) by promoting innovation, economic competitiveness, and national security while  
minimizing regulatory burdens, in line with the administration’s vision to remove barriers and  
foster private sector growth.
---
### 1. Hardware and Chips
- **Policy Action**: Strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing to secure the AI
hardware supply chain. Offer tax incentives for companies to build and expand chipproduction facilities in the U.S. and allocate funding for research and development (R&D) intonext-generation AI hardware, such as advanced processors optimized for AI workloads.- **Rationale**: Reducing reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly from adversarial nations,is critical for national security and economic resilience. A robust domestic chip industryensures the U.S. remains competitive in AI innovation.
### 2. Data Centers and Energy Efficiency
- **Policy Action**: Streamline permitting processes and provide tax incentives to acceleratethe construction and expansion of data center infrastructure. Invest in research for energy-efficient AI computing technologies, including low-power algorithms and hardware designs.- **Rationale**: Data centers are the backbone of AI computation. Supporting their growthwhile addressing energy consumption ensures sustainable scalability without compromisingenvironmental or economic goals.
### 3. Model Development and Open Source
- **Policy Action**: Reduce regulatory barriers for startups and small businesses entering theAI space through simplified compliance frameworks and grants. Encourage open-source AIdevelopment by establishing clear legal protections for intellectual property (IP) rights withinopen-source ecosystems.- **Rationale**: Fostering innovation requires lowering entry costs for new players while


ensuring that open-source collaboration thrives, balanced with protections that incentivize
creativity.
### 4. Application and Use
- **Policy Action**: For government use, develop streamlined procurement guidelines for AIsystems that prioritize cost-effectiveness and security. For the private sector, eliminateunnecessary regulations that hinder AI deployment while maintaining basic safety and securitystandards.- **Rationale**: Efficient government adoption of AI enhances public services, while a lightregulatory touch in the private sector unleashes innovation and market growth.
### 5. Explainability and Assurance
- **Policy Action**: Fund research into interpretable AI systems and support the creation ofindustry-led standards for validating AI model outputs.- **Rationale**: Transparent and reliable AI systems build public trust and facilitate wideradoption, ensuring outputs are understandable and verifiable without stifling development.
### 6. Cybersecurity
- **Policy Action**: Mandate robust cybersecurity measures for AI systems, including regularaudits and certification processes tailored to protect against AI-specific attacks (e.g., modelinversion or adversarial inputs).- **Rationale**: As AI systems become critical infrastructure, safeguarding them from cyberthreats is essential for national security and economic stability.
### 7. Data Privacy and Security
- **Policy Action**: Establish clear, practical guidelines for data handling in AI developmentthat align with existing privacy laws, avoiding overly restrictive mandates that could hamperinnovation.- **Rationale**: Protecting user data is vital, but excessive regulation risks slowing progress.A balanced approach ensures privacy without choking the data-driven AI ecosystem.
### 8. Risks and Governance
- **Policy Action**: Adopt a light-touch regulatory framework focused on sector-specificrisks (e.g., healthcare, transportation) rather than broad, one-size-fits-all rules. Create avoluntary risk assessment and mitigation framework for AI developers.- **Rationale**: Targeted oversight addresses genuine risks like bias or safety concerns whilepreserving the flexibility needed for rapid innovation.
### 9. National Security and Defense
- **Policy Action**: Prioritize AI R&D funding for defense applications to enhance U.S.military capabilities. Implement strict export controls on sensitive AI technologies to preventadversarial access.- **Rationale**: AI is a strategic asset. Strengthening its role in defense and restricting itsproliferation to rivals safeguards national security.
### 10. Research and Development
- **Policy Action**: Increase federal funding for cutting-edge AI research through grants touniversities and research institutions, complemented by tax incentives for private sector R&Dinvestments.- **Rationale**: Sustained investment in foundational and applied AI research ensures the


U.S. remains at the forefront of technological breakthroughs.
### 11. Education and Workforce
- **Policy Action**: Launch initiatives to train the next generation of AI professionals,including scholarships, apprenticeships, and updates to educational curricula at all levels.- **Rationale**: A skilled workforce is the bedrock of AI leadership, ensuring the U.S. hasthe talent to drive innovation and implementation.
### 12. Innovation and Competition
- **Policy Action**: Promote a competitive AI marketplace by reducing barriers to entry fornew firms and enforcing antitrust measures to prevent monopolistic practices.- **Rationale**: A dynamic, competitive environment spurs innovation and preventsstagnation, benefiting consumers and the economy.
### 13. Intellectual Property
- **Policy Action**: Clarify Intellectual Property laws as they apply to AI-generated worksand AI systems, ensuring creators can protect their innovations.- **Rationale**: Strong IP protections incentivize investment and creativity, critical drivers ofAI advancement.
### 14. International Collaboration
- **Policy Action**: Partner with allies to develop global AI standards and norms, positioningthe U.S. as a leader in shaping the international AI landscape.- **Rationale**: Collaborative efforts amplify U.S. influence, ensuring global alignment withAmerican interests and values in AI governance.
### 15. Export Controls
- **Policy Action**: Define clear, enforceable export controls on sensitive AI technologies,with guidelines specifying restricted applications and destinations.- **Rationale**: Preventing adversaries from acquiring advanced AI capabilities protectsnational security and maintains a strategic edge.
---### Conclusion
The AI Action Plan should prioritize policies that unleash private sector innovation, securecritical supply chains, and protect national security while minimizing regulatory burdens. Byfocusing on infrastructure support, targeted investments, and clear guidelines—rather thanheavy-handed oversight—the U.S. can solidify its dominance in AI, driving economic growthand human flourishing as envisioned in Executive Order 14179. These concrete actionsprovide a roadmap to achieve that goal.
