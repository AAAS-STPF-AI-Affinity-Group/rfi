General Comment
AI is a scam  and a half. A groundbreaking innovation m ade useless through corporate greed that, at best, is used as a toy by the average
person to see what insane answers ChatGPT gives over the m ost basic quests; and, at worse, is used as an excuse to fire countless
workers because "why hire you when AI can do your job just as well."
AI is a plagiarism  m achine m ade to regurgitate inform ation it has no way of fully understanding.
Keep it in the spreadsheets if you're going to use it at all
