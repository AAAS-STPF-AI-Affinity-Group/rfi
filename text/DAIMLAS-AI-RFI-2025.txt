Submission DAIMLAS - AI Ecosystem Builders, Comment by Joseph Wehbe: 
To maintain global leadership in AI, the US must create pathways for more talent, and 
industry to participate in the AI economy.  According to the 2024 Global AI rankings, the 
US ranks #1 overall, but we are ranked #2 on both “Operating Environment” and 
“Government Strategy”.  Here’s how we can achieve #1 ranking on both.  
Recommendation 1: invite leaders from all AI Labs/AI Centers of Excellence/AI Degree 
programs/Investors with AI thesis/Industry Associations/AI k-12 programs in the 
East/West Coast to meet in Boston/Washington DC/Silicon Valley respectively for a 
summit to share their resources and how more stakeholders in every corner of America 
can participate.  Recommendation 2: The AI ecosystem must be anchored in 
Academia where Chief scientific advisors lead, so stakeholders who want to utilize 
American compute should connect to their local institution via a local AI center of 
excellence/AI lab.  These labs may have alliance programs/screening mechanisms for 
the public to participate.  Recommendation 3:  Every community college, state college, 
Ivy league, k-12 school should increase AI awareness/offerings at the grassroots level 
to evangelize AI use cases/AI jobs/R&D.  This encourages more State governments to 
establish an AI strategy.  DAIMLAS has built 4 American AI ecosystems in MA, DC, CA, 
NJ and is ready to continue to support, by organizing the proposed summit, and to 
contribute to building local AI ecosystem platforms in all 50 States (Made in America AI) 
that have commercial opportunities globally. Recommendation 4: DAIMLAS has the 
data of all American AI Ecosystems and can map all the resources in every corner of 
America so that we can contribute to Government Strategy in AI, and AI R&D. Joseph Wehbe
