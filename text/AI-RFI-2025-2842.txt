General Comment
No lim itations to AI technology are "burdensom e" or "unnecessary". Unrestricted AI developm ent can and will absolutely lead to harm
and abuse from  businesses, m ilitaries, and even m alicious individuals. Ethics need to be considered, and you do that by preventing abuse
before it starts. 
There is no such thing as unnecessary or burdensom e requirem ents, the only people that believe that that is the case are people that want
to use AI for abusive purposes.
