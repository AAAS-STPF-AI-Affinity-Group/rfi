General Comment
Do not give copyright im m unity to AI, this will have disastrous results to everyone inside and outside of the AI research sector.
AI, as we now know it, is never capable of critical thought, and it uses an exorbitant am ount of electricity and water to run AI data
centers. It is a stain on hum anity that has no right to exist.
Do not give any control to the AI research sector in any way whatsoever.
