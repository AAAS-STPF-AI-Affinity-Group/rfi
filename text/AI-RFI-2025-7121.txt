General Comment
AI, which steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft, does not have a place in the future of our country. AI does not
benefit the Am erican people, and is only being used as a tool for corporations to profit off of the work and intellectual property of hard-
working Am ericans.
