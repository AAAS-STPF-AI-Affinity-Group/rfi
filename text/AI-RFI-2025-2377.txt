General Comment
Allowing AI to access copyrighted content will absolutely destroy and ruin art as we know it. So m any sm aller artists and individuals who
live off of their work will be left unable to to survive if AI is allowed further access to everything. Its harm ful to so m any people and I am
against any further AI developm ent based on using peoples content to fuel AI training
