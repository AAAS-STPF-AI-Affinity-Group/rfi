General Comment
I have no interest in AI and I do not want it anywhere near m y writings. I worked hard on them  and the idea that som eone can com e
along and, essentially, drop it in a blender with a bunch of other peoples' work without even bothering to interact with the original is deeply
offensive to m e on just about every level I can think of.
AI is awful and I want no part in it.
