General Comment
Under no circum stances should any com pany or governm ental body be allowed to use any copywritten or personal work to train an AI
LLM. Without full IP protections, all anti-piracy laws should be dism antled im m ediately, and all intellectual property released to the public
dom ain. There is no stance that legally or m orally reconciles both.
