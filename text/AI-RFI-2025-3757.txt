General Comment
Generative AI has no place in innovation or creative works. Using sam ples from  artists results in essentially stolen and sub-par work as AI
attem pts to copy what an actual hum an can do. It steals the livelihood of Am ericans in an attem pt to profit off of theft. It is a dying industry
that is on its way out, and investing Am erican tim e and m oney into it would be a com plete waste. The highest proponents of generative AI
either do not know what they are supporting or are just looking to m ake som e quick m oney.
It would be a disservice to the Am erican public to invest in it.
