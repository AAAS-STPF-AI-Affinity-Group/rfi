General Comment
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
These m achines will never be able to m im ic hum an creativity and will only hurt the econom y with less jobs for the people. Generative AI is
scum m y and only m akes people m ore lazy and cheap
