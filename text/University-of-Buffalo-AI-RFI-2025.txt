The University at Buffalo’s response to Request for Information (RFI) on the 
Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan (“Plan”)  
Introduction  
The University at Buffalo (UB), a flagship campus of the State University of New York 
(SUNY) system, has long been a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) research. With a rich 
history of pioneering contributions  from the early development of AI -powered 
handwriting recognition systems for postal automation1 to leading the National AI 
Institute for Exceptional Education (AI4ExceptionalEd)2 and the National Center for 
Early Literacy and Responsible AI (CELaRAI)3, UB has consistently advanced AI 
technologies , specializing in  cybersecurity, information security and biometric s, with a 
focus on addressing societally significant and challenging issues.  
As the U.S. seeks to define and solidify its leadership in AI, it is essential to prioritize 
research and development that both drive  economic growth and harness  AI’s 
transformative potential to address critical challenges in areas such as education, public 
safety and healthcare . UB’s longstanding commitment to these areas of AI research 
offers important insights and recommendations for the development of an AI Action 
Plan. We propose policy priorities that will not only enhance U.S. leadership in AI but

2 also ensure that AI serves as a tool for public benefit, economic competitiveness, and 
global influence.  
UB’s Role in Pioneering AI Technologies  
The University at Buffalo has been a leader in AI research for decades, contributing to 
advancements that have had both academic and societal significance. One of the 
earliest examples of UB’s success in AI was the development of handwriting recognition 
technology in the 19 90s, which revolutionized postal automation systems and became 
one of the first major practical success stories of AI by improving mail delivery while 
simultaneously generating significant savings of millions of dollars for the US Postal 
Service4. This early success demonstrated the immense potential of AI technologies to 
solve complex, real -world problems.  
As AI technology has advanced, UB has continued to push the boundaries of 
innovation. More recently, UB received funding from the NSF and IES NCSER to 
establish the National AI Institute for Exceptional Education, spearheading the 
development of AI tools t o screen, diagnose, and intervene for children with speech and 
language disorders. This multidisciplinary center represents a critical intersection of 
domains such as computer science, speech, language pathology, communication and 
education, with the poten tial to provide personalized, scalable interventions for children 
with developmental challenges.  UB’s research in this area underscores the potential for 
AI to dramatically improve educational outcomes and help children overcome obstacles 
to learning and communication across the country.   
In addition to these groundbreaking projects, UB has continued to expand its AI 
research into other critical areas. These efforts contribute to the national and global 
dialogue on how AI can be used to address complex societal issues. Recently, UB has 
anno unced the creation of a new department, Department of AI and Society, with close 
collaboration between UB’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and 
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). UB’s collaborations with industry, government, and 
other a cademic institutions will continue to ensure that its AI research leads to both 
academic advancements and real -world applications. These partnerships are essential 
in ensuring that AI innovation aligns with national priorities in healthcare, transportation , 
education, and sustainability, ensuring U.S. leadership in these areas of significant 
national interest.

3 Leadership in Transforming Society with Positive Impact, and  Boosting U.S. 
Global Competitiveness.  
To maximize the societal impact of AI and maintain U.S. leadership in this critical area, 
we strongly endorse the following policy actions:  
Priority #1: Accelerate Funding for AI Research with Societal Impact  
The U.S. government should significantly increase funding for AI research 
focused on solving societal challenges, many of which are not a primary focus for 
commercial investment. Universities are well -positioned to lead research that 
addresses those critic al issues. One such area is AI -augmented special 
education, which can transform the lives of children and greatly enhance their 
ability to contribute to the workforce and the economic prosperity of the nation.  
Why it Enhances U.S. Competitiveness:  Incenti vizing the development of AI -
driven solutions focused on societal challenges will improve the quality of life for 
the nation’s citizens; and emphasizing AI for socially impactful initiatives is an 
investment for the long -term prosperity, security, and soci al well -being of the 
United States.  
Priority #2: Create AI Innovation Hubs to address  Societal Challenges  
The U.S. should prioritize fostering partnerships between academic institutions, 
government agencies, and private industry to accelerate AI innovations.  
Universities are uniquely positioned to serve as hubs for such collaborations with 
industry, government and non -profit organizations.  U.S. universities have 
traditionally been at the forefront of advancing the state of the art and 
partnerships with indust ry can help to quickly translate  the research into practical, 
market -ready applications. To this end, the government should incentivize the 
creation of AI innovation hubs, where stakeholders from various sectors can 
collaborate to create AI solutions that have both commercial and societa l value.  
Why it Enhances U.S. Competitiveness:  Public -private partnerships drive the 
rapid commercialization of AI technologies, positioning U.S. companies and 
institutions as global leaders in an AI-driven economy.  
Priority #3: Promote AI Literacy and Workforce Development  
To remain competitive in the AI space, the U.S. must invest heavily in AI 
education and workforce development. This includes integrating AI literacy into 
K-12 curricula, creating robust undergraduate and graduate programs focused on


4 AI, and offering reskilling programs for the existing workforce. Universities play a 
vital role in this critical endeavor. The government should also incentivize 
companies to invest in AI -related training programs that prepare workers for the 
demands of an  AI-driven economy.  
Why it Enhances U.S. Competitiveness:  A well -trained AI workforce is 
essential to maintaining U.S. leadership in AI. By investing in AI education and 
reskilling, the U.S. can ensure a pipeline of talent capable of developing and 
deploying AI technologies that will define the future of the glo bal economy.  
Priority #4: Strengthening Economic Growth and Job Creation  
While AI is often associated with automation and job displacement, a strategic 
emphasis on AI for societal benefit creates opportunities for new industries and 
jobs focused on societal improvement. For example, in education, it can lead to 
the demand for n ew skill sets and new opportunities such as curriculum 
designers  who create AI -augmented learning materials and tools to ensure that 
education remains relevant in a rapidly evolving technological landscape and 
teacher training programs  that prepare educators to incorporate AI -powered tools 
into classrooms, enhancing their teaching methods and improving student 
engagement.  
Why it Enhances U.S. Competitiveness:  A commitment to AI for societal 
benefit can make the U.S. an attractive hub for global talent and investors.  AI 
technologies that promote effective governance and public services lead to 
increased overall economic competitiveness.  By leveraging AI for so cial 
progress, the U.S. not only addresses domestic challenges but also reinforces its 
global technological and economic dominance.  
Conclusion  
The University at Buffalo is committed to advancing AI research that has a direct, 
positive impact on society. As the U.S. continues to shape its AI Action Plan, it is 
imperative that policy frameworks are crafted with a clear focus on harnessing AI’s 
potential for public benefit  while maintaining the nation’s leadership in this 
transformative field.  
By investing in AI research, promoting ethical standards, fostering public -private 
collaborations, and prioritizing workforce development, the U.S. can continue to lead the 
global AI race. UB is ready to partner with the federal government, industry, and o ther 
academic institutions to ensure that AI remains a tool for solving humanity’s greatest 


5 challenges while reinforcing the United States’ position as a global leader in innovation 
and technology .
