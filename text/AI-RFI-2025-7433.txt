General Comment
I am  a professional writer; at this tim e, the only tool artists such as m yself have to m ake a living is through the protections of intellectual
property law. OpenAI and other large language m odel businesses have, from  their inception, been dependent upon using the
UNCOMPENSATED work of visual, audio, and written word artists to create their products. While there is a great deal of utility for AI
and m achine learning in the sciences--which do not depend on stolen data to train their AI--large language m odel AI in particular depends
upon continued theft of intellectual property from  those least able to pay legal fees to defend them selves. If the United States wishes to be
a leader in AI, this ongoing theft m ust be addressed. AI com panies m ust at the least be required to m onetarily com pensate, at a fair
m arket rate, those whose work they have until now stolen. Additionally, people who do not wish to provide their intellectual property to
these com panies regardless of com pensation m ust have their property rights respected and protected. Additional exam ination m ust be
m ade of intellectual protection and copyright laws as well, to ensure those laws protect hum an creators rather and exclude the product of
m achines built upon stolen intellectual property.
