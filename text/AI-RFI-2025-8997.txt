General Comment
Monopolizing creative work through a LLM is theft. Moreover, it’s reassignm ent of ownership by m onied decree. Copyright becom es
only enforceable by those that can afford lawyers. Ai isn’t dem ocratizing art, it is stealing m illions of people’s life’s works to feed
overreaching corporations. It is a m istake, it is a sham e. Hum anity deserves better.
