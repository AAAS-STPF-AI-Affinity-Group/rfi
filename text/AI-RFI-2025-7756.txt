General Comment
Mem ber of the public here who *does* want there to be regulations on AI. No AI com pany should be able to use an artist's work
without their perm ission,and they should pay them  for it. By artist,I pretty m uch m ean anyone who has created som ething--any written or
visual m aterial. Any written work by anyone--fiction, nonfiction, reporting, science articles, textbooks, you nam e it. Sam e for visual
works. Oh, and m usical works, too. AI com panies should not be allowed to STEAL people's creative works! And by the way, I think
every generative AI product I've com e across is stupid and soul-deadening. Nobody wants Google's often dangerously wrong "AI
overview," no one wants weird AI custom er service. Bring on the regulations and stop shoving AI down our throats.
