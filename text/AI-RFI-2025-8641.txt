General Comment
Regarding generative im age tools specifically, AI does not learn the way that people learn, is not a person, and cannot be "educated".
Moreover, com panies like OpenAI are not educational institutions. 
The use of the data of private citizens - even when that data is publicly visible - is not protected as fair use for the purpose of training
generative AI or large language m odels. These tools are bad for industry and bad for freelancers in the arts. They steal our intellectual
property without consent or com pensation, and use it illegally to sell a service that im itates and undercuts our services and businesses by
stealing the results of our work. They destroy jobs, they violate IP rights, and allowing them  to scrape data without consent is bad for
Am erican businesses at every level from  the freelancer sole-proprietor to the Disney-Pixar board room .
It is m y view that OpenAI and its com petitors owe the Am erican people com pensation for reproducing, storing, and reselling their data
without consent.
