General Comment
The use of copyrighted works in the training data of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is nothing short of enabling the wholesale theft and
plagiarism  on a m assive scale. This will greatly affect - but is not lim ited to - living artists, authors, designers and com puter program m ers.
At absolute m inim um , those people deserve control of their works and their ingestion into the training data. This includes, but is not lim ited
to, rem oval of their work from  the training data, ledgers to m aintain what output was created derived from  their work and and financial
com pensation for any output derived from  their work featured in the training data.
However, I have nearly no faith that this Governm ent will work to enforce the rights of artists and creatives and to that end - I anticipate
you will go full-steam  ahead in the acceleration of AI. If so - I look forward to when China again m anages to undercut our efforts for
pennies-on-the dollar and all we have to show for it is a com plete lack of cultural value.
Reduced to a billion generated im ages that convey no em otion, m usic that resonates with as m uch value as elevator m usic and
program m ing that is inefficient and of poor design.
