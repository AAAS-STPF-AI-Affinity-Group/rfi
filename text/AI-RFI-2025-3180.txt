General Comment
I urge you to think about the consequences and what will happen years down the line if copyrighted works/data/m aterials are allowed to
be used without a proper license for training generative AI system s. Besides the point that they will be used without a license for "learning
processes", the output of these system s are alm ost never an inventive com bination of learned abilities. Som etim es the outputs are
piecem eal am algam ations of source m aterials, but m ost com m only they are over-fitted copycats of source m aterials the AI system  was
trained on.
Allowing generative AI to be trained with copyrighted m aterial creates m ultiple loopholes against the favor of copyright holders because it
can produce near replicas of its inputs if prom pted/queried in very specific ways. It is encouraging plagiarism  to say that if the process to
achieve a generated output is obfuscated enough, it's OK for it to nearly identically m atch som e input. In fact, this won't even be about AI
anym ore if the claim  can be m ade that som ething cam e from  AI but is really just plagiarized without it.
