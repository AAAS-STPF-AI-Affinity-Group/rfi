General Comment
If this passes through, that m eans the governm ent is giving the greenlight to the theft of one's own voice, written works, art, and properties.
I do not believe it holds a future for the US. It'll ruin people's lives, and it's overhyped and fleeting in the eyes of the public. Do not
greenlight this request!
