General Comment
It should be illegal for AI to steal art and literature that hum ans produce and turn it into an AI slurry that corporations will then use
whenever they need art or text that they would otherwise pay an artist to produce. It’s like asking artists and writers to train their robot
replacem ents for free. It’s worse than that actually because it is theft. And it’s really m uch m ore than theft because it is so widespread. So
m any people have been harm ed and will continue to be harm ed by the ram pant pilfering of their creations and will lose m oney going
forward when AI “art” is used to save m oney over hiring an actual hum an. This is terrible for the econom y.
