General Comment
Ignoring for a m om ent the environm ental im pact that m ass AI usage currently causes. Copyright and tradem ark exists for a reason. No
one, be they are person or corporation, gets to steal in m ass other peoples work to profit from  without paying those they are stealing
from . Please tell Disney lawyers that it's OK, actually, to steal and reuse their intellectual property without consent. See how well that goes
for you.
