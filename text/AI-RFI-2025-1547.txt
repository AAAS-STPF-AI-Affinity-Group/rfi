General Comment
The plans that the tech industry has for AI are nothing m ore than a gross violation of citizen rights. If left u checked and unregulated the
tech industry will have an unfair advantage across m ultiple industries and hurt sm all businesses. They dream  of a future where solely two
entities exist: the com pany and the consum er. I im plore you to protect sm all businesses and keep copyright protections in place.
Individuals have the right to refuse to lend their work to a m achine that will steal it and their business. Without copyright, the individual has
no incentive to innovate or create. This will only hurt our country.
