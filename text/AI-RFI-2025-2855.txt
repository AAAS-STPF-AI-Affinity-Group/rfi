General Comment
Genuinely nothing of any significance will be gained by letting a m achine that has already eaten dozens upon dozens upon dozens of other
creator's works eat even More works to produce, at absolute best, shoddy facsim iles. This technology cannot do anything that one would
trust highly trained people to do. Giving a com puter the kinds of responsibilities these people plan to can only lead to m ore people getting
hurt than any kind of significant gain, which is nothing to say about the excessive am ount of power usage these generative AI creations use
up.
