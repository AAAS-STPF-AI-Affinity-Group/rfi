General Comment
In a world where copyrights protect individual, groups, and organizations from  their creation being stolen from  them , m onetized without
their perm ission, and protected from  abuse, this protection deserves to rem ain a policy for all industries. No one should get an exception.
If AI com panies cannot train their AIs without ethics, then those AIs should not exist. If AI com panies cannot train their AIs without
stealing people's work, then those AIs should not exist. In theory, AI is a good thing that is going to allow for m ore individuals to have the
freedom  to do what they want, but if we can't get there without AIs scraping content from  every inch of the internet, then we don't deserve
AI. Please do not give in to the tech industry and their lies. They can follow the laws as they currently exist around copyrights. And you
can enforce them  if they don't.
