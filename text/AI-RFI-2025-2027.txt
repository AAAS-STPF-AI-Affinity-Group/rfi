General Comment
Private sectors have enough freedom  and dom inance as it is, copyright laws are one of the few things individuals and sm aller creatives can
rely on to protect them selves and their work from  being scraped by others without rightful com pensation. To allow AI “trainers” to scrape
as they please creates an unregulated m arket and could lead to a m onopoly in the creative m arkets and even a crash in the industry.
