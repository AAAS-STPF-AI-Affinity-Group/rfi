General Comment
It is inexcusable for private com panies to skirt around copyright law in their efforts to train their "AI" system s. Any private or corporate
entity who wants to use copyrighted works, m ust com pensate the owners of that copyright. Copyright is the bedrock of intellectual
property law in the US, allowing us to dom inate in the entertainm ent sector. If we want to continue to create high quality m edia, we cannot
penalize creators and producers, allowing the theft of their work in favor of an often com peting business m odel.
