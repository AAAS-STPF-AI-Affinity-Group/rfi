General Comment
While it's true that AI has great potential to help the world, it also has great potential to harm . As with any advanced technology, such as
nuclear power and weapons, great care m ust be taken to avoid catastrophe.
I am  extrem ely concerned that rem oving safeguards from  the developm ent and deploym ent of AI will result in financial decim ation of
creative artists, writers, and m usicians, as well as increase the risk of unintended side effects of AI that are devastating to large sectors of
the Earth's population.
I urge you to tread with caution. The profits of the few should never outweigh the safety and security of the m any.
