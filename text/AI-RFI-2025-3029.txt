General Comment
AI as it is currently being peddled by technocrats is a flawed and broken technology. It cannot properly respond to queries without
providing broken and in som e cases dangerous nonsense. The use of it to generate artistic works requires training on copyrighted
m aterials, m aking it outright theft. Software users overwhelm ingly despise this technology and DO NOT want it polluting any resources
that we use. The governm ent SHOULD NOT use this technology for analysis or predictive purposes as the results are inaccurate,
unreliable, and untrustworthy.
