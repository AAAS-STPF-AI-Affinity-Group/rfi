General Comment
AI developm ent should be be dedicated to m aking it m ore useful to the com m on person and not a bragging right. Please don't let the
desire for power cloud proper judgem ent and take note of how AI is affecting jobs, inform ation, and safety already. I suggest putting
m ore regulations on how it can be used, such as requiring m ore hum an elem ents to revew its output rather than hit and m iss results.
