General Comment
Copyright is a fundam ental way by which creators can profit from  and protect their work. The United States has repeatedly sought to
extend copyright term s in recognition of its im portance. Allowing any com pany to steal copyrighted work for any purpose is and should be
illegal. If a com pany cannot produce their product without theft, then by definition they are thieves, whether they are stealing goods or
intellectual property. If AI is such a boundless source of wealth and product, then it should be easy for AI com panies to pay creators for
the use of works they have already stolen, and pay for the use of works in the future.
Again, no supposed "innovation" is worth creating a backdoor for copyright protections. They are im portant and lengthy because they are
im portant. They incentivize creativity and innovation, unlike AI products which incentivize idiocy.
