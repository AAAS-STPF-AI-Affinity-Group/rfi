Re: National Science Foundation’s Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
Action Plan
I am a software developer wi th three year s of e xperience across two jobs, so my understanding and 
stance on AI comes from less of a creative-driven industry and more o f a technological industr y, and it is my 
understanding that allowing AI technology to run off of c opyrighted work doesn’t o nly compromise creative-
driven jobs, but also compromises workplace securit y, all for a result s that are insufficient. 
Much development tools have begun integrating AI-driven development, including companie s such as 
Salesforce, and Atlassian, whose tools I’ve used as part of development, such as Slack, Confluence, and J ira. 
These companies have begun integration o f AI, which means products I’ve begun work on are already having 
their data scraped, when they haven’t even been made publicly available. Granting AI free access to 
copyrighted materials means that if someone uses what AI has scraped to publish a tool, than the companies 
I’ve worked at are now in danger of their product being released by som eone else before they’re even able to. 
This puts the world of technology in dange r.
Please do not allow AI to use copyrighted data. It will cause more harm than good.
Thank you for your time,
-Anthony Fairfax
