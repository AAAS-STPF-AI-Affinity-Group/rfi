General Comment
Investing in the current wave of generative artificial intelligence will be disastrous for Am erica's future. It rem ains unclear what actual value,
if any, this kind of AI has to the average everyday Am erican besides being a tim e-wasting novelty toy. Allowing this useless technology to
do what it pleases unim peded will tear up and destroy the livelihoods of working-class citizens in m ultiple industries and give them  nothing
in return. The action plan we need for AI is how to stop the big tech m oney behind it from  doing irreparable dam age to the Am erican
econom y. A strong, dom inant nation doesn't have a use for this.
