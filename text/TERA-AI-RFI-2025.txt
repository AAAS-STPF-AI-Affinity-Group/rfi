 In our comment, we outline the strategic importance of AI in advancing  hard  tech inno-
vation, highlighting how this field  differs from general -purpose AI due to the lack of 
large, diverse, and high -quality training datasets. We explain how TERA -print  is devel-
oping technologies to bridge this gap, unlocking AI’s full potential for materials discovery  
and disruptive technologies development . Finally, we provide key recommendations on 
the AI Action Plan, ensuring that America secures its leadership in this critical technolog-
ical race. 
Strategic Importance of AI for Hard Tech Innovation 
Technological leadership in biotechnology, medical devices, microelectronics, and chem-istry has long driven economic strength, national security, and global influence. From genomic datasets powering precision medicine to nanoscale materials enabling high -per-
formance semiconductors, breakthroughs have consistently reshaped industries and for-tified geopolitical standings.  
Emerging  hard tech innovations increasingly  rely on miniaturization down to the micro - 
and nanoscale to unlock novel properties, enhance functionality, and significantly boost multiplexity  and parallelization— enabling entirely new capabilities across industries. 
However, current  micro - and nanofabrication methods  remain  costly, slow, and limited 
in scope – primarily optimized for semiconductor applications . Not only does this con-
strain the pace of hard tech innovation , but also leaves vast opportunities across biotech-
nology, medical devices, advanced materials, and beyond remain largely untapped.  
AI has the potential to dramatically accelerate the design, optimization, and commercial-ization of breakthrough micro - and nanostructured technologies —unlocking novel prop-
erties, enhancing performance, and enabling entirely new capabilities across critical  in-
dustries, all while significantly reducing reliance on costly and time -intensive physical 
experimentation.  
Just as AI is enabling Apple and NVIDIA to design cutting -edge chips that dominate the 
industry, it has the potential to revolutionize biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, defense , 
and other hard tech sectors. For example, AI-driven design could help biotech and 
pharma companies develop more sensitive diagnostics and breakthrough therapies, while the military could leverage AI to create multifunctional devices for next -generation 
sensing, autonomous systems, and resilient ba ttlefield technologies —enhancing natio nal 
security and technological superiority.  
Outside of the semiconductor industry and, to some extent, drug discovery, such ad-vanced AI models either do not yet exist or remain severely limited in capability.   How-
ever, the first to develop and deploy these models will gain a lasting competitive ad-vantage —reshaping industries, strengthening national security, and defining the next era 
of technological dominance.

Data  is the Bottleneck for the AI-Driven Hard Tech Industrial Revolution  
AI models require extensive, high -quality datasets to generate accurate predictions. Yet, 
in most hard -tech sectors— including biotechnology, medical devices, microelectronics, 
and chemistry— data remain fragmented, scarce, and inconsistently structured, in stark 
contrast to the vast, readily available datasets that fuel general -purpose AI.   
Additionally, as seen in advanced general- purpose AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and 
Claude, performance rapidly converges when trained on similar publicly available da-
tasets —underscoring the strategic importance of proprietary data as the key differentia-
tor. The same principle applies to domain -specific AI models —organizations that control 
the most comprehensive and proprietary datasets will gain an unrivaled competitive edge, drive future innovation, and solidify global technological leadership.  
The U.S. must therefore close this data gap first to maintain its technological edge and prevent adversaries from gaining a strategic advantage.  
The challenge, however, lies in the vast design universe of hard  tech technologies —span-
ning materials and complex 3D architectures —which is extraordinarily diverse and 
nearly infinite. This makes it exceedingly difficult to generate adequate training datasets and develop transformative AI models that can generalize not even across, but within 
specific applications.  Many of these problems are computationally intractable due to their 
hyperdimensionality . Miniaturization to the micro - and nanoscale in emerging  hard tech 
innovations  further complicates experimental prototyping and data generation, as tradi-
tional fabrication technologies are prohibitively slow, expensive, and restrictive – espe-
cially beyond  semiconductor materials and applications.  
This  means that w inning the AI —and, consequently, the broader technological —race in 
hard  tech domains is not just about advancing algorithms or generating more data. The 
key lies in first developing generalizable physical -world technologies capable of produc-
ing training datasets with significantly higher throughput, versatility, and relevance to 
real-world applications.  
TERA -print’s Technologies for  Unparalleled Large- Scale Datasets Generation and AI 
Advancement  in Hard Tech: Powering  America’s Technological and Economic Do mi-
nance  
TERA -print  is pioneering  the world’s most advanced and versatile  suite of tools, enabling 
massively parallel experimentation and prototyping with micro - to nano- precision across 
diverse  materials and hard tech applications .  
These tools empower researchers to conduct tens of thousands to millions of chemical syntheses experiments to develop novel materials  or synthesize on demand DNA chips , 
prototype thousands of functional devices —such as sensors and optical components —or 
fabricate advanced multi -material structures with unprecedented properties, such as

 those for tissue engineering  or self- healing surfaces. What once took months or even years 
with current methods can now be achieved in just hours.  
By integrating complementary high- throughput screening capabilities tailored to specific 
applications, these tools become the most powerful platforms— not only for experimental 
discovery and prototyping but also for the rapid generation of the largest training da-
tasets in hard- tech domains where micro - and nanoscale precision is essential.  
TERA -print’s tools have already facilitated breakthroughs  such as the discovery of novel 
drug delivery ve hicles, brighter blue light LEDs,  and new catalysts compr ising lower crit-
ical materials for low intensity hydrogen production, just to name a few.  
Remarkably, these tools cost only a fraction of that of advanced semiconductor fabrication 
systems, require no expensive or complex supporting infrastructure, and are compatible 
with a wide range of biological and organic materials— an inherent limitation in the sem-
iconductor industry.  Moreover, the underlying technology is highly scalable, enabling a 
10- to 100 -fold increase in the platform’s data generation capabilities . 
We strongly believe that massively parallel experimentation, fabrication, and characteri-
zation technologies —such as those developed by TERA -print  and others —will be the cor-
nerstone for generating the critical hard -tech datasets currently lacking. By enabling data 
creation at an unprecedented pace and scale, these technologies will unlock the most ad-vanced AI models in this domain, securing the U.S. ’s competitive dominance in the global 
technological race.  
Recommendations for America ’s AI Action Plan  
TERA -print  believes that, among other important priorities, America ’s AI Action Plan 
should emphasize the following points.  
Infrastructure . Many  of the AI -based tools familiar to Americans, such as ChatGPT 
and consumer -facing platforms like Google Gemini, are trained on vast datasets 
sourced from publicly available internet content or open -domain repositories. How-
ever, applying AI to the cutting e dge of technology demands specialized datasets that 
go beyond the public realm —tailored to highly specific and often sensitive conditions 
for a given application. To secure long -term leadership in AI -driven hard -tech inno-
vation, investments must focus on the foundational systems , instruments,  and tech-
nologies that enable the rapid generation of massive experimental datasets across a 
wide range of applications . By prioritizing physical -world technologies, the U.S. will 
safeguard its technological leadership from foreign imitators in ways that purely soft-
ware -based solutions cannot.  
Additionally, establishing Centers of Excellence— whether as standalone facilities, 
within national labs, or at universities —for large -scale data generation is essential to 
advancing the AI Action Plan in the context of disruptive hard te chnologies of the

future. Each Center would have a specialized focus —biotechnology, energy, aero-
space, semiconductors —attracting the nation’s most promising innovations to 
strengthen U.S. technological leadership and national security.  
Moreover, there is a need to establish a standardized database architecture tailored to 
specific applications and domains, along with a centralized repository that enables multiple stakeholders to contribute and access high -quality datasets. This framework 
would facilitate collaboration, enhance interoperability, and accelerate AI- driven ad-
vancements across critical industries.  
Investment . Just as physical infrastructure is essential for overcoming the challenges 
of data generation at scale , so too must the U .S. strengthen its investment apparatus 
to bridge the funding gap —commonly known as the “valley of death” —that exists 
between innovative startups and full -scale commercial and industrial deployment. 
The pace of development and the longer payoff timelines inherent to hard -tech break-
throughs often fall between the cracks of traditional venture capital models, which 
prioritize rapid returns, and existing grant mechanisms, which are often too incremen-tal to support sustained, capital -intensive innovation. To maint ain its technological 
edge, the U.S. must adapt its funding strategies by expanding long -term ( patient) cap-
ital initiatives, leveraging the strengths of programs like the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, and directing strategic public investment toward long -term, 
high- impact AI and hard -tech innovations. A restructured investment framework  that 
aligns with the realities of deep -tech development is critical to ensuring these trans-
formative technologies reach market viability and reinforce national leadership.  
Industrial Collaboration through Policy  and Grants . Building an AI startup ecosys-
tem capable of addressing industry’s most pressing challenges requires a strategic ap-proach to fostering collaboration between early -stage researchers in academia, gov-
ernment, and private industry. While necessity drives invention, innovators must have visibility into these critical needs —siloed efforts risk slowing progress and un-
dermining global competitiveness. The AI Action Plan should wo rk to clearly com-
municate industry priorities and incentivize partnerships between industrial players and academic institutions, government agencies, small businesses, and other domestic entities. Additionally, the plan should integrate with existing fundi ng mechanisms, 
prioritizing high -risk, high -reward projects —whether pursued independently or 
through industrial collaborations —to accelerate transformative breakthroughs.  
These proposals aim to accelerate America’s leadership in AI -driven hard -tech innova-
tion by expanding massively parallel, real -world experimentation— unlocking unique, 
high- value datasets essential for training the most advanced AI models.  
TERA -print  has been a proud recipient of government small business grants through 
the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy,  and the Department of 
Defense over its lifetime.   The work and experience gained through  these programs  has

exemplified the value of empowering small businesses and early -stage  researchers to 
tackle pressing problems and develop powerful products to address industrial and 
government needs. The sum of these grants  totals roughly $ 2.9M  over 10 years, but in  
the lifetime of these grants, TERA -print has generated multiple novel micro - and 
nanofabrication tools capable of generating massively parallel  low-cost datasets and 
embarked on multiple collaborative projects with private and public entit ies that were 
manifested through the projects.23 These projects are focused on high -impact areas such 
as biotech and semiconductor materials where accelerated materials discovery  and de-
vice design  are fueled by massive dataset generation, the exact type of projects that will 
unlock and be revolutionized by AI.  
Expanding federal investment in large -scale data generation technologies for hard tech 
is essential to maintaining America’s leadership in AI and advanced technology , reduc-
ing its  reliance on foreign technologies, and accelerat ing the development of disruptive 
technologies of the future critical to defense, biotechnology, and industry.  
* * *
In summary , TERA -print  is a tremendous believer in America ’s efforts and abilities to 
spur an industrial revolution  with  AI and establish a new global dominance in doing so . 
We are ready to support these efforts and help accomplish  America ’s goals  in relation to 
the AI Action Plan. 
Very truly yours,
