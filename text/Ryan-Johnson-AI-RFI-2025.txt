Dear Collaborators of the AI Action Plan,
I would like to submit the following as comment in regards to the AI Action Plan:
1.Generalizing "AI"  - behind this label are the actual mechanics and accelerators within
currently available technology (large-language models, machine learning, etc.). We
should recognize these toolsets directly and broadly demystify how they work.
2.Abuse of the idea of "AI"  - Without a demystification, people will abuse this label and
hold power over others using fictional narratives of grandness (i.e. Wizard of Oz).
3."AI" as a guest  - We need to look at the root level of American culture and how local
economies are best organized from the bottom-up. For too long we have molded citiestop-down at the expense of decency. The introduction of new accelerated technologiesshould be as practical utilities of a
 genuine foundation, and guests to what is our work.
4.Opt-out option- Everything built in this space needs to be arm's length by its nature.The history of abuse demonstrated by the first wave of computers and digitalization hasset a precedent for all involved. New tools may provide greater transparency (i.e.Blockchain), but new agreements must be forged collectively for where this isappropriate. Each use case will mature, but opting out should always be an option.
