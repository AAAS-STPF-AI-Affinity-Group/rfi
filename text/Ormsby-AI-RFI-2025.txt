As someone working as a visual artist, I am very frustrated that there's nothing being done to 
reign in companies from stealing our works to Train their models. It should absolutely be 
criminal for them to use these LLMs for profit when they had no right to integrate all the source materials they had no right to use. This does not help America "flourish." It will just allow tech companies to profit off of the work of others with impunity.
