AI is overhyped and it does not fit into the future of the US. It steals livelihoods daily, and will only continue to do
so if Executive Order 14179 is passed. AI is simply another trend that will continue to grow until it inevitably pops,similar to NFTs.
AI will never replace the human spirit in art, and allowing these companies to allow their algorithms to take
copyrighted images with NO consequences, you ate destroying livelihoods, killing the arts, and leaving theAmerican People suckling on the teat of an ARTIFICIAL intelligence.AI is still hackable, it isnâ€™t and will never be perfect, and passing this order will open the possibility for terroristgroups to indoctrinate the youth, masking hate speech and radical ideology behind what could simply be interpretedas an officially licensed piece of media, for example.
There are no safeguards to control and punish those who use AI for malevolent purposes, and allowing the
floodgates to open to AI will absolutely destroy the nation.
