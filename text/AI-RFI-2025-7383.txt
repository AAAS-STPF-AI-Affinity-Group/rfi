General Comment
Please do not let this pass! It is blatant theft from  the Am erican people. If this adm inistration is really about putting the citizens first, AI
should not be able to run am ok and plagiarize off of us. There will always be a large m ajority fighting against this type of technology. The
hype can only last so long. We, the people, will m ake sure that developing this tech to steal will be a waste of tim e. We will not blindly
accept this.
