General Comment
I am  horrified at the reckless pace at which AI is progressing and the absolute lack of legislation to protect the intellectual property of
hum an beings. It is com ical to push this as a way to ensure Am erican dom inance in a creative field, because these program s inherently
weaken our creative rights by stealing without consultation or com pensation. The best way to protect Am ericaâ€™s creative future is to value
the rights of our creative citizens, not tech com panies seeking to stripm ine our creations.
