General Comment
My livelihood is rooted in creating art and AI is an active threat to this. It does not create, it steals. It blends up and regurgitates the efforts
of real people and can not be allowed to have free reign. AI that is used solely for profit and not the benefit of the people has no place in
the United States governm ent. Value living, breathing people.
