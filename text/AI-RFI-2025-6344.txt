General Comment
I am  extraordinarily dissatisfied with AI being forced into everything. AI m akes m y work m ore difficult. AI offers no value whatsoever to
education or writing. Am ericans should be protected from  the inundation of AI into everything. It should not be forced into all of our
software. Additionally, legal copyrights should be honored, and the illegal theft of written or visual inform ation to "train" AI should be
penalized by the strictest m easures. Am ericans have been greatly abused by the governm ent's allowance of this theft. Sim ilarly, Am ericans
have purchased software that has becom e unusable due to the forced im plem entation of AI within the software. Generative AI has never
been designed to be factually accurate, and it is beyond irresponsible for any business, governm ent office, or classroom  to use generative
AI as if it were capable of distinguishing fact from  fiction. Even on a creative level, AI operates based on the m ost com m on patterns,
producing the opposite of creativity. We do not need or want these plagiarism  m achines spitting out biased m ediocrity to be determ ining
ANYTHING AT ALL for the Am erican people. Protect and defend copyright laws. Error-ridden pattern-m aking m achines have no place
in m anagem ent, education, or business.
