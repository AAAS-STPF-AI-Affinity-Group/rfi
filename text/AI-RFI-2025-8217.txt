General Comment
Just recently, OpenAI released a statem ent saying that AI is over, because AI m aterials are not copyrightable and rely on stolen property.
Given that, why in the world is the US wasting its m oney and tim e on a technology that is proven to be pretty useless as well as hastening
the destruction of our planet. Studies have proven tim e and again that AI provides incorrect answers or invented inform ation up to 60% of
the tim e. See, e.g. https://arstechnica.com /ai/2025/03/ai-search-engines-give-incorrect-answers-at-an-alarm ing-60-rate-study-says/
Moreover, AI aggregates data and has a high potential to spit out personally identifying private inform ation to unauthorized sources. These
m achines are rife with bias and invention and underm ine our national security interests.
Divest from  AI, or else this country will regret it.
