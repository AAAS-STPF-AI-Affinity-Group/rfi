General Comment
Any use of an "AI Action Plan" using AI that is developed using copy-righted m aterials would be unacceptable. Individuals and com panies
ought to have the right to decide whether their proprietary content is opt-in for use in training AI - whether it is a line written on social
m edia to photos of their children, an illustration of Mickey Mouse or a m anuscript for a published book. 
We've already seen how m uch dam age AI theft has done - from  purloining people's personal m edical records for use in their 'generative
AI training' to generating inappropriate im ages of m inors based on m illions of stolen photos of people's children. Generative AI creators
have plagiarized the work of generations, and should not to pretend that blatant theft and total disregard for the rights of both individual's
personal content and IP holders' intellectual property is an acceptable way to conduct them selves. Such actions should be deem ed
copyright infringem ent, and our governm ent should absolutely not m ake use of such technology.
