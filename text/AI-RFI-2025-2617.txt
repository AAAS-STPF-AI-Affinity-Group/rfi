General Comment
AI, especially generative AIs, m ay cause problem s related to theft/copying of people’s work in a way that does not fit within the context
of ownership. There have been cases where generative AI has used artists’ works as training data without perm ission from  the artist
them selves. Further AI developm ent without regulations m ay lead to m ore of these types of problem s.
