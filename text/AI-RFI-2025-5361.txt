General Comment
Do not allow for this developm ent to take place. On a technical level this will allow for ram pant IP theft, for im personation of any person
from  civilian to high ranking governm ent officials, and ram pant m isinform ation to take place as their algorithm  im proves, along with an
oversaturation in the creative m arket as all legitim ate creatives will be pressed under a m ountain of ai generated m aterial that would be
m ade in m ere m inutes and look identical since the users are not people who have legit care for the process of creatives. On top of that all
parties that the com panies will be stealing from  will receive zero com pensation and larger scale com panies will see this as theft of their
properties as people begin stealing their work and sim ply m aking their own in their hom es, likely attem pting to profit off of this cheap,
instantaneous process through m eans of selling their ai generated works to the m asses that can sim ply be replicated again and again should
one get taken down and another takes it's place. This is a danger on a m oral, econom ic, and legal scale that the ai CEO's will not care to
enforce until they m ake their m oney and can disappear because they were given free reign to com m it copyright theft on a m ass scale with
zero repercussions for their actions.
