General Comment
Hello, I am  asking you to please oppose this ruling; not only this takes away the right of property for one but this also takes away
Copyright law, intellectual property rights, and takes away the freedom  of speech to request anything to be returned and taken down to
what the owner created, written, et cetera to be taken away, and it steals jobs.
Therefore, I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of Am erica for a good benefit, it all prom otes and profits off from  theft from  the
livelihoods of citizens, which is very unlawful.
