General Comment
AI profits off of the theft of intellectual property. Allowing AI, as it is, to flourish would be stealing any potential from  individuals.
Please, do NOT allow openAI to be able to break all the copyright they want. It’s not right to allow them  to take the work of other
people and profit off it. Profits m ade by them  is profits lost from  other hard workers.
