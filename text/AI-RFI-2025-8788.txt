General Comment
The AI industry not being held accountable for the data they are scraping and where it is from , is an egregious oversight and will lead
untold issues, just begining with copyright. This will hurt m ultiple industries, workers and livelihoods. AI operations should have to build
their own data sets and not steal from  artists, engineers and countless others within our nation and around the world.
