General Comment
As a working artist and cartoonist, I strongly caution the National Science Foundation to avoid giving AI com panies the ability to steal and
profit off of individuals' creativity. It would be tantam ount to legal theft and a dissolution of copyright law as it stands to allow this to take
place, and would stym ie creative fields across the nation, ending in an inevitable sludge of AI being feed only by AI.
