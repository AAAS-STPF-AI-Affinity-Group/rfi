General Comment
"AI" doesn't deserve us, nor do we either need or want "AI."
I cannot abide by the notion that the "burdensom e" copyright restriction m ust m ake exceptions for this so called "AI," exceptions that don't
extend to the broader public. Neverm ind the only thing that this "AI" has ever proven itself to ever be good for is duping norm al people
out of their tim e and/or m oney, letting the lazy cheat their way through qualifications, and just m aking stuff up to the uncritical am ong us.
If anything, "AI" aught to be throttled rather than given functionally official approval, as the data centers that power "AI" have been
starving com m unities across this country (and the rest of the world) of their electricity and water, all for the sake of m achines that cannot
tell right from  wrong.
