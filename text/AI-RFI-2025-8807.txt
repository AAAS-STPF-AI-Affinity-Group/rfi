General Comment
AI doesnâ€™t have a place in the future of the US
AI com panies should be held to the rules of the land and not get a special carve out for harm ing Am ericans and their works
AI is purely hype and ultim ately not
and AI is useless gim m ick that will only harm  the future of the US
