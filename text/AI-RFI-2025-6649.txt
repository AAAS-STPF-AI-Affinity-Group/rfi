General Comment
If training LLMs on unlicensed copyrighted m aterial is to be ruled fair use, then all other com m ercially-m otivated uses of copyrighted
m aterial m ust also be ruled fair use, as well as any individual access to copyrighted m aterial.
Either you com pletely neuter the idea of copyright protection, or you adm it that you are unfairly and unnecessarily handing power over to
tech com panies and billionaires at the expense of actual creative people.
