Hello.
AI is a threat to the livelihoods and security of millions of Americans. It is an immense weight  
on our power grid. It’s potential is dangerous, and it needs to be heavily regulated.
As a professional who has used AI for office work, and creative work, I am largely  
unimpressed by it. I find it useless for pretty much everything I have used it to produce. The  
most impressive use cases I have seen for this technology were things that the google search  
algorithm or translator already did. In times I have used AI to search for information, I have  
found AI suggested me uninformed and misleading information. Often misrepresenting the  
sources this technology is sourcing.
This is a gimmicky, fad tech. It’s this year’s crypto, or NFT. It’s a waste of our country’s  
resources, and a threat to the copyrights of our people.
Do not fund AI.
Regulate AI heavily.
Thank you.
Casey Daniels
