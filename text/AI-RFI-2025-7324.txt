General Comment
It's absolutely absurd! That law would not only anger people online, but com panies all over the world will be giving backlashes and
censures for allowing unbidden copyright infringem ent. If they can't sue OpenAI to prevent it, they'll just sue the US governm ent as a
proxy until you drop this horrid act.
