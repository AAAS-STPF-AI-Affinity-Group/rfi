General Comment
AI m ust be safely regulated, and the plan to develop AI without regulations is a very poor one. 
It is im possible to catch up with Chinese m odels now and AI has no m onetary value in the m arket. The regulations and guidelines already
in place will force better quality, and m uch m ore functional AI, provided researchers focus on im proving their m odel quality, instead of
how m uch data it can steal, a net gain for all involved.
