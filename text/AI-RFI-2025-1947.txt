General Comment
Any AI plan that does not respect the rights of copyright holders underm ines the rights of writers, artists and creators in every field, and
the basis for a large swath of the econom y. Legitim izing copyright theft sim ply because it was done on a m assive scale and for the benefit
of a few wealthy people is not good public policy.
In addition, AI regulations m ust put address the quality of the data AIs are trained on, and hold AI com panies accountable for when their
products "Hallucinate": eg: cite articles or studies that don't exist to support conclusions that actually have no basis in fact, or sim ply spew
forth com plete inaccuracies.
And finally, AI m ust not be allowed to m ake decisions that take effect without hum an review. The AI false positive rate when used to
detect "fraud", for exam ple, is as high as 80%. A program  that is so consistently wrong cannot be allowed to execute decisions on its own,
and the regulations should reflect that.
