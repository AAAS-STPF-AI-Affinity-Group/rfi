General Comment
I am  very uneasy about this action plan. AI is typically trained on copyrighted m aterial, without any com pensation or attribution for the
people whose m aterial is being used. Given that this copyrighted m aterial is then incorporated into the AI's output, this is tantam ount to
theft and/or plagiarism . As an academ ic librarian, I spend a great deal of tim e teaching students about citing sources and other aspects of
proper attribution. The fact that AI uses the intellectual and artistic output of others without the kind of attribution or citation we would
expect in even high school level student work is appalling.
Please rethink this plan.
