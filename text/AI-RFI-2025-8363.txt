General Comment
There is no legal or m oral standing for giving tech billionaires free reign on copyrighted works. Why are they to be held to a different
standard than the rest of society? If their m achines cannot work properly without unfettered access to the work som eone else legally owns
without their consent or com pensation, then it deserves to fail. 
AI com panies are actively bad for society from  both a creative and social perspective.
