Hello, I am in full support of the action plan. In order to maintain American lead, we need to 
support and finance research. Cutting of this funding will result in America's ability to stay 
ahead. As a parent of an 11 year old learning about AI programming , I am very concerned if 
funding to critical institutions such as universities is reduced in these critical technologies then 
America will fall behind and our physical and economic security will suffer.
