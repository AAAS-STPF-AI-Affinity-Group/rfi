AI needs to be regulated, intensely. It is used non-stop to generate inappropriate  images of
minors, non-consenting women, and other vulnerable groups.  
It is also being used to intrude on the copyright of creatives, from writers to artists.  
AI is not worth leaving uncontrolled. It will become a major problem. It will be used against
america.
