Introduction 
As artificial intelligence continues to transform our society, economy, and national security, the 
United States must establish a comprehensive and forward-looking strategy to maintain global 
leadership in AI research, development, and implementation. We respectfully submit the 
following recommendations to inform the Administration's AI policy priorities, with particular 
emphasis on education, research funding, and workforce development. 
Policy Recommendations 
1. Expand NSF's AI in K-12 Education Programs
The National Science Foundation has demonstrated remarkable foresight by investing in AI 
K-12 education for well over a decade. In light of recent advances in generative AI and
increased international competition, we recommend significantly expanding these successful
NSF initiatives. This expansion should build upon existing frameworks while updating curricula
to address emerging AI capabilities and applications. The program should continue to support
the development of age-appropriate materials that address four essential levels of AI
engagement: conceptual understanding, practical awareness, application skills, and systems
control. Expanded funding should support teacher professional development, curriculum
materials, and necessary technology infrastructure to ensure all American students develop AI
literacy from an early age, matching or exceeding initiatives in countries like China that have
alreadyimplemented systematic AI education beginning in elementary school.
2. Strengthen NSF Funding for AI Research and Education


The National Science Foundation has been instrumental in maintaining U.S. leadership in 
scientific and technological innovation. We recommend significantly increasing NSF funding 
specifically designated for AI research, with particular emphasis on: 
●Foundational AI research that advances capabilities in machine learning, natural
language processing, and multimodal systems
●Use-inspired research that applies AI to critical domains including education, healthcare,
and scientific discovery
●Research on effective human-AI collaboration models to maximize productivity and
innovation
●Development of secure, privacy-preserving AI technologies that protect user data
This funding should prioritize both individual research grants and the establishment of 
multi-institutional research centers that bring together diverse expertise to address complex 
challenges. Growth in these areas has had and could continue to have a profound impact on 
American innovation, commercial growth, and to maintain global leadership in AI. Our 
advantages on all fronts are significant. 
3. Create an AI-Ready Workforce Development Program
To prepare Americans for the jobs of tomorrow, we recommend establishing a coordinated 
workforce development program that spans secondary education, higher education, and 
mid-career training. This program should: ●Support the development of undergraduate and graduate programs in AI and related
fields
●Fund apprenticeship and certification programs that provide practical AI skills training
●Create incentives for industry-academic partnerships that connect education to
real-world applications
●Establish portable credentials that validate AI competencies acquired through various
educational pathways
4. Support Research on AI-Human Collaboration Models
The most promising future for AI lies not in replacing human capabilities but in creating powerful 
collaborative relationships between humans and AI systems. We recommend dedicated funding 
for research that explores optimal models of AI-human collaboration across critical sectors. This 
research should investigate how AI can: 
●Augment teacher capabilities through enhanced awareness of student needs
●Support personalized learning approaches that adapt to individual student progress
●Enhance workforce productivity in blue-collar professions like automotive repair,
construction, and manufacturing
●Improve healthcare delivery through AI-assisted diagnostics and treatment planning
●Strengthen customer service while maintaining meaningful human interaction


●Create new employment opportunities rather than displacing workers
5. Develop AI Integration for National Security and Defense
AI is radically changing how we can protect ourselves and our allies, and our national security 
increasingly depends on both our service members and civilians understanding AI technologies. 
To maintain technological superiority in defense capabilities, we recommend establishing a 
strategic initiative to responsibly integrate AI systems across military training, operations, and 
logistics. This initiative should: 
●Fund research on military-specific AI applications that enhance operational
effectiveness, both cyber and physical
●Develop AI-based training systems that improve military readiness through realistic
simulations
●Create secure, robust AI systems that can operate in contested environments
●Establish guidelines for responsible AI use in national security contexts
●Ensure broad AI literacy among both service members and the civilian workforce
supporting defense
6. Strengthen U.S. Higher Education Leadership in AI
America's higher education system is a powerful engine for innovation and talent development. 
To maintain this competitive advantage, we recommend policies that: 
●Increase graduate fellowship funding in AI-related fields to attract and retain top talent
●Support AI research infrastructure at universities including computational resources and
datasets
●Facilitate knowledge transfer between academic research and commercial applications
●Expand international student programs in AI fields while creating pathways to retain this
talent in the U.S.
●Establish AI-themed pipelines between K-12 education and higher education to ensure
that talent is grown within the U.S. and remains here
7. Create a National AI Testing and Evaluation Framework
To ensure AI systems meet standards for reliability, safety, and performance, we recommend 
developing a comprehensive testing and evaluation framework that: 
●Establishes metrics and benchmarks for AI system performance across various domains
●Creates standardized evaluation protocols for key AI capabilities
●Provides resources for independent verification and validation of AI systems
●Supports research on methods to test increasingly complex AI architectures
8. Fund Foundational AI Research for National Benefit


The federal government should prioritize funding for AI research that serves as a foundation for 
national advancement but may not occur naturally through industry or state-level initiatives. 
Such funding should focus on: 
●Basic research in AI that may not have immediate commercial applications but will drive
long-term innovation and discovery
●Educational applications of AI that support learning and development across the lifespan
●Capacity-building infrastructure that democratizes access to AI tools and knowledge
●Empirical research that objectively evaluates AI impacts, benefits, and potential risks
●Cross-disciplinary initiatives that connect AI capabilities with humanities, social sciences,
and other fields
This research is most effectively conducted through our world-leading universities and research 
institutions, which have consistently demonstrated their ability to advance fundamental 
knowledge while training the next generation of AI innovators and leaders. By strategically 
investing in this foundational research, the United States will maintain its global leadership 
position while ensuring AI development aligns with broader societal goals and values. 
Conclusion 
The United States stands at a critical juncture in AI development and implementation. With 
strategic federal investment and coordinated policy initiatives, America can maintain its global 
leadership in AI innovation while ensuring these technologies benefit all citizens. The 
recommendations outlined above represent essential steps toward a comprehensive national AI 
strategy that balances technological advancement with thoughtful implementation and broad 
access to AI literacy and skills. 
By investing in research, education, and workforce development, the United States can ensure 
that AI technologies enhance human capabilities, strengthen our economy, and support our 
national security while reflecting American values and priorities. Public understanding of AI, 
widespread access to resources, and provision of cutting-edge AI tools to American families are 
critical components of maintaining America's technological leadership. Our higher education 
system and research universities, supported by robust federal funding, will continue to serve as 
the cornerstone of American leadership in AI innovation and application, ensuring these benefits 
reach all sectors of society.
