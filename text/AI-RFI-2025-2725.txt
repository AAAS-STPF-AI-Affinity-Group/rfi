General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica.
AI has proven tim e and tim e again to only benefit those who steal and take credit for work that isn't theirs.
AI is fully reliant on the input of other hum an works, m ost of which are not sourced directly from  the person them selves, but from
unknowing third-parties that never consented for their work to be taken in the first place.
This is leads to a clear infraction of both intellectual property and copyright law. AI should not be m ade an exception under any
circum stance. 
The work and process of hum an creativity and the value in m aking things like art, m usic, or anything in a creative space will ultim ately
suffer greatly if AI is allowed to run ram pant without strict lim itation. We should strive to protect those who share their ideas, concepts,
visions, and work. These things keep culture alive and prom ote creativity in the individual. Not through a m edium  that has no hum an sense
of culture, direction, ethics or m orality that creates the end product for them .
If anything, we need m ore regulations and protections in place to safeguard people from  AI and the dangerous things it can be used for
both foreign and dom estic.
