General Comment
Artificial Intelligence...m ainly generative AI...is dependent on existing works and properties to produce content, which could include
copywritten m aterial. Giving AI perm ission to use this m aterial is technically copyright infringem ent, and hurts public and independent
content creators alike.
If this plan is put into action, please see to it that generative AI is forbidden.
