General Comment
I strongly believe that generative AI is inherently corrosive to our society. It steals from  the livelihoods of Am ericans, then profits from  that
theft. It also represents a m assive erosion in public trust, allowing weapons-grade generation and distribution of m isinform ation.
Additionally, it m akes little sense to invest in this speculative technology at a tim e of serious financial instability. This plan cannot be
allowed to go forward.
