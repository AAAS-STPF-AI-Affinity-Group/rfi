General Comment
AI is at best a waste of m oney and at worst is actively harm ing individuals who create, and truth be told it does both at the sam e tim e all
the tim e. We need m ore protections for artists and creators who are targeted by people who "use" AI, not less. Destroying copyright just
so big AI corporations can m ilk what little art they have not been able to get their hands on is not a good idea. At best, this will not effect
m assive corporations like Disney, and at worst, everyone else in the world will stop interacting with the USA because of the new
copyright laws. Why would you interact with a country that is going to actively steal everything you show them ? If we get rid of copyright
protections so AI com panies can m ake m ore m oney, we're going to becom e the new Russia for the rest of the world, a danger to
everyone else to the point where everyone will hate us unless we buy them .
Pretty m uch: if we allow corporations to do whatever they want with AI, then everyone is going to hate us and we will be killing
artists/creatives. Nobody actually wants this, som e say they do, but they really don't.
