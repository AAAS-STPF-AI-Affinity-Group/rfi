General Comment
As an entrepreneur who both creates com ics for m obile publishing and helps SMB enterprises harness the power of data, I recognize
both the power and responsibility of putting together a thoughtful Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. Already the free m arket has leapt to
em brace the possibilities of the technology, creating prediction m odels to m ore quickly analyze large data sets and guide strategic
decision-m aking. In the right contexts, AI can be a powerful tool. My biggest concern are the legal and ethical im plications of training data
m odels on copyrighted works not owned by the user. Any products that leverage generative AI should only be used for educational
purposes and should NOT be considered 'sellable.' The creative industry already suffers enough from  digital piracy as it is. By establishing
a fram ework for dataset sharing that respects the rights of copyright holders on both sides, the governm ent can lay a foundation for
sustainable growth and attain its goals of AI dom inance and innovation.
