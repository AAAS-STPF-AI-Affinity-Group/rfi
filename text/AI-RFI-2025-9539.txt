General Comment
I am  an Am erican artist, both by trade and as a hobbyist. I have spent years of m y life building the skill necessary for m y work. I am
strongly opposed to giving generative AI com panies free reign to take whatever art they want, regardless of ownership, copyright or
consent. 
What these people are asking for is to essentially be allowed to com m it widespread theft of intellectual property, for free, without
perm ission or consequence, to profit off their ill gotten gains, and for this widespread theft to be protected by law. 
Regardless of what the intention of use is, AI tech com panies should not be allowed to profit off of the stolen work of m illions of artists.
This will take away countless jobs from  those in the creative field and destroy the concept of copyrights and ownership.
