General Comment
My nam e is Zac Goldfain and I am  a 2nd sem ester senior at AVonworth High School, I studied generative AI and its im pact on Sports
Managem ent for two m onths in a course on AI and Ethics this year. From  m y research, I think this current adm inistration's viewpoint on
AI regulation is putting our nation in the right direction. While researching AI in Sports Managem ent, I was able to see various ways in
which AI was beneficial to those in the field. Sports in our country are one of, if not the m ost televised things of today. They create unity
with fanbases and com petitive rivalries that m any people live for. AI's im pact on sports has continued to grow rapidly and with our new
adm inistration, I believe Am erican sports can becom e the largest worldwide in every aspect. With AI's im provem ents, m any big sports
team s have been able to collect data and quickly find ways to im prove their team s. Whether it's player health, gam e strategy, or behind-
the-scenes m anagem ent, AI has sim plified the sports world and m ade sports safer for athletes while also growing viewership for fans.
Athletes are what allow us to watch sports, therefore m aking their health and safety a priority. AI's new developm ents have allowed
m edical staff to track player injuries and healing progress, giving athletes the ability to play at their peak perform ance. If we continue to
develop AI in the right direction, it will significantly help in the sports world, which we all know and love in our nation.
