General Comment
I worry if this Ai plan will go too deep into m y personal Data. I'm  trying to talk to people and network not com pete with an Ai bot that is
trying to understand what I'm  looking for. Not to m ention with the intrusive nature of data collecting where are these lines being drawn for
the purpose of education.
