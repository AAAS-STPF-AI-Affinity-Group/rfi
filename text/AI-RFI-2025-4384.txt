General Comment
Generative AI program s, whether text or im age based, need to train on large data sets. The currently available offerings, such as OpenAI,
Google’s Gem ini, Meta’s search function, X’s Grok, all have trained on the illegally obtained copyrighted m aterial of writers and artists.
It’s theft and the com panies behind it have adm itted as m uch in various court cases. Not only that, it’s filling our digital spaces with subpar
crud, m isinform ation, and terrible “art”. Artists and writers should not have their rights abuses just so these large corporations can continue
too shove their unwanted product down everyone’s throats. Its integration into areas such as education, m edia, and law have already
degraded everyone’s experience and proven harm ful.
