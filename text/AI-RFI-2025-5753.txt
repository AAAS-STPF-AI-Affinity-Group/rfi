General Comment
The use of AI technology as it currently exist is nothing short of poor quality and craftsm anship. AI program s routinely steal from  artist and
writers in order to “create“ their content. What they create is not original, and if left unchecked like is currently being proposed, it will lead
to the utter destruction and desecration of genuine works of art by creators. Art is not a com m odity and it is not som e thing that can be
turned out on an industrial scale, like what AI technology does. It is som ething that takes real hard work, dedication, and passion that
com es from  the hum an spirit and im agination. AI technology should not be allowed to be able to run am ok and ram pant unchecked
supervision.
