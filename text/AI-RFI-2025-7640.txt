General Comment
OpenAI should not be allowed to train their m odels on copyrighted content without som e sort of legal protections for the owners of said
intellectual properties. 
Allowing organizations, like OpenAI, to run am ok will irreparably harm  our society as a whole in a plethora of way. Perhaps irreparably.
Legal ownership of intellectual properties will be underm ined. Creative works would be rendered worthless or outright drowned out in a
sea of AI generated content. This would effectively be cultural suicide unlike anything hum anity has ever encountered before.
All brands, logos and characters/actors could be reproduced without perm ission, which in nefarious circum stances could be used to
legally fram e certain individuals or organizations for crim es they did not com m it. 
Som ething needs to be done before we reach that point of no return. When the very core pillars of our dem ocracy are at stake here.
