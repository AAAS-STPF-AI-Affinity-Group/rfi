Hello, I am contacting you in regards to  your recently announced AI Action Plan set to make the 
American people and the United States government more reliant on the use of AI for everyday 
use, the economy and government surveillance. Simply put I do not at all support the use of AI as it stands now to be used in conjunction with the government, as of now the general public 
perception of AI is universally low with it's usage in various other aspects of life (such as art, it's algorithms supplying objectively wrong information, unconscious biases plaguing it's programing and the use of it to stereotype and marginalize others) is incredibly harmful to both the US and the world at large. Not to mention the environmental impact it will have when the earth is already in a fragile enough state as is. Sim ply put the implementation of the AI Action 
Plan will do nothing but harm the American people at large and will do nothing but serve the right winged bigots who wish to implement it for their own goals. I will finished it up with this, DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE AI ACTION PLAN.
