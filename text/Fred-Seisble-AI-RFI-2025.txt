i have serious conerns that AI will be abused, and I think these questions should be asked. Who 
has control of AI? goverments cant be trusted,large corporations, and anyone political also cant 
be trusted. power inherently corrupts. Does privacy even exist?  How much more privacy are we 
willing to give up since 09 -01-01? Can and will this AI be weaponised, against individuals, 
political rivals, other goverments? Is this for betterment of mankind or another way to control 
people?
