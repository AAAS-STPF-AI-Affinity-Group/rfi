To whom it may concern,
AI is already lacking in properly defined  safeguards and transparency requirements at the
federal level.   Ensuring "that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private
sector AI innovation" is appalling this early in the development of AI.   If anything, the federal
government should be limiting and tracking where these private companies are securing their
information and holding them responsible for unlawful stealing of human  created  content.   AI
generated art already steals from the livelihood of my friends and many other  Americans; if
left unchecked, AI as a whole will impact many more Americans.   Companies should also be
held responsible for what their  AI generates.   Please ensure that instead of serving us up on a
silver platter that Americans are protected from the predatory companies that want to harvestanything within their reach to cultivate their AI monstrosities.
