Emerging Ethical and Legal Issues Related to the     
Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Automatic Speech Recognition 
(ASR),  and  Digital Audio Recording in Legal Proceedings  
Court reporters are highly trained professionals who share a unique ability 
to convert the spoken word into information that can be read, searched, 
and archived. These experts also are known as “guardians of the record” 
because of their impartiality and ro le within the judicial process primarily 
capturing the words spoken by everyone during a court or deposition 
proceeding. Court reporters then prepare verbatim transcripts of 
proceedings.  
Stenographic machine and voice court reporters are impartial officers of the 
court who must comply with state laws and federal and state court rules 
regulating their practice.  
The official record or transcript they generate helps safeguard the legal 
process. By combining their skills with the latest technology, some court 
reporters provide realtime access to what is said during a trial or deposition 
for the benefit of all involv ed parties. A court reporter providing realtime — 
the only proven method for immediate voice -to-text translation — allows 
attorneys and judges to immediately access a transcript while also 
providing a way for people who are deaf or partially deaf to partic ipate in 
the judicial process.  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subsets, such as machine learning, are 
only among the latest in more than a century of technological advances 
that have disrupted and ultimately advanced the professions of court 
reporting and captioning. AI is defined as “a machine -based system that 
can, for a given set of human -defined objectives, make predictions,  “This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business -
proprietary or confidential information. Document contents may be reused by the 
government in developing the AI Action Plan and associated documents without 
attribution ..”

recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments,” 
according to the National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2020.  
As highly trained, tech -savvy professionals, America’s court reporters and 
captioners have long mastered cutting -edge innovations to bring the 
spoken word to text accurately in real time. Indeed, today’s court reporters 
can accurately capture in writing 22 5 or more spoken words per minute in 
real time.  
Clearly, court reporters do not fear or avoid technology innovations when 
they know that such changes are reliable, trustworthy, and strengthen 
transcript protection, accuracy, access, and speed. However, AI has flaws 
and is developing so rapidly that even  the world’s leading AI developers 
and users are urging caution and greater control by governments. Indeed, 
more than 1,000 CEOs and AI leaders sent a joint letter in early 2023 to 
policymakers urging federal and state governments to establish guardrails 
and standards for the application and creation of AI systems.  
These leaders emphasized that AI and the use of machine learning or AI 
technologies to process human speech into text (known as Automatic 
Speech Recognition or ASR) are not unimpeachable in their work and 
outcomes.  Such technologies have already proven to  be untrustworthy and 
risky for the court reporting profession, especially when compared to the 
tremendous human expertise, integrity, and experience of court reporters.  
Other leaders and practitioners in the judicial system also have expressed 
concern and warnings about the growing use, ethics, and influence of AI 
and ASR in the nation’s legal system. The House of Delegates adopted a 
resolution at the 2023 ABA Midyear Meeting on Monday that addresses 
how attorneys, regulators and other stakeholders should assess issues of 
accountability, transparency,  and traceability in artificial intelligence.  
Resolution 604  calls on organizations that design, develop, deploy,  and use 
AI to follow these guidelines:  
•Developers of AI should ensure their products, services, systems,
and capabilities are subject to human authority, oversight,  and
control.

•Organizations should be accountable for consequences related to
their use of AI, including any legally cognizable injury or harm caused
by their actions, unless they have taken reasonable steps to prevent
harm or injury.
•Developers should ensure the transparency and traceability of their
AI and protect related intellectual property by documenting key
decisions made regarding the design and risk of data sets,
procedures and outcomes underlying their AI.
Ensuring AI is developed and used in accordance with established 
standards and guidelines as well as in conjunction with state and federal 
rules and laws is critical when the use of such technology could erode the 
public’s confidence, trust, and faith in t he fairness and legitimacy of the 
judicial system.  
The federal justice system and the justice systems of every state rely on 
the integrity and accuracy of the trial court record for appeals. Without a 
proper record of what occurred in the trial court, an appellate court may be 
left to decide matters of law  based on the best available means, including 
the appellant’s recollection.  
Courts unable to attract and retain stenographic court reporters, coupled 
with always -evolving technology, may push decision -makers and the public 
to ask why court proceedings are not digitally recorded and automatically 
transcribed by computers or manuall y transcribed by humans later.  
Most people agree that digital technology has brought important benefits to 
society. However, the authentication of digital multimedia is an emerging 
challenge since it has become increasingly easy to manipulate recorded 
audio contents using a growing numb er of free and generally accessible 
software tools. 
Today, when authenticity examinations are conducted on digital audio and 
video files, the purpose of these complex analyses is fourfold to determine 
if a file (1) is an original or clone (i.e., a bit -for-bit copy) or a re -encoded or 
transcoded copy, (2) co ntains any alterations, (3) has any discontinuities 
due to stop or start events, and (4) matches the characteristics  of a 


4 | Page JEOPA R D IZ IN G  JUST ICE  AI Action Plan  
specified recording system, if known. These authenticity examinations, 
probably more than any other forensic laboratory analysis, require a more 
conceptual rather than a purely ‘cookbook’ protocol, since every case is at 
least somewhat different from any o ne preceding it, due to differences in 
the audio/video material, metadata, compression effects and various forms 
of possible duplication and alteration .  
Members of the public should be advised if AI and/or ASR is being used in 
litigation and should be cautioned regarding those risks. Courts should 
expect deepfake audios and videos to begin to find their way into court 
transcripts and files.  
Currently, transcripts prepared by digital reporters and/or AI/ASR 
transcription companies include cleverly worded or misleading “certificate” 
pages that are designed to give legitimacy to a document that, in essence, 
has no basis for certification if one person who administered the oath and 
witnessed the proceedings records the audio file and another person 12 
transcribes the audio file without comparing the resultant transcript. Proper 
certification and authentication are further complicated if there are multiple 
undisclosed transcribers involved.  
How can courts protect against these dangers? First, courts can take stock 
of their own internal security practices. If audio or video is being used to 
capture the record in courtrooms, it is vital that control measures be 
implemented that govern who has a ccess to these files and how file access 
to others outside the organization is granted.  
Washington, after a legislative effort, is an excellent example of a state 
establishing safeguards for its courts. Its new court rule requires chain of 
custody for audio file in addition to a court requirement to provide 
authorized transcriptionist standar ds and oversight.27 Another safeguard 
would be if a court maintains an “approved” transcriber list and prudently 
takes the additional measure of knowing each person within the 
transcriber’s organization who has access to the files and how they are 
transfer red. Does each transcriber maintain adequate virus protection on 
their computer, for instance? While the latter may seem like a mundane 
question, the public may be surprised at the answers, and the court may 


5 | Page JEOPA R D IZ IN G  JUST ICE  AI Action Plan  
want to ensure that safe practices are being followed by its authorized 
providers. It only takes one data breach for a catastrophic event to occur, 
so protocols and standards should be developed, defined, and adhered to 
rigorously.  
Another dilemma the courts must wrestle with is evidence introduced by 
counsel at trial that involves transcripts introduced after having been 
transcribed from audio or video sources created outside of the court on 
privately owned audio or video recording devices. Strong safeguards 
should be put into place regarding the chain of custody of all audio or video 
media and/or transcripts generated by a method using only audio or video 
for transcript production. These pose significant risks of manipulation if 
strict protocols are not followed — another reason close attention should be 
given to the “certificate” page of all transcripts. Such scrutiny would 
determine when one has been recorded and transcribed after the fact, 
especially when doing so conflicts with a ny state laws.  
ASR, AI, and Racial, Gender, and Age Bias AI lacks the capacity for 
contextualization that humans possess. It works by combining large data 
sets with intuitive processing algorithms that can be manipulated by 
learning behavior patterns within one or more d ata sets. What is clear 
across multiple studies is that training data has led machines to learn more 
about white men’s speech patterns and less about those of women and 
people of color. One case in point is that Stanford researchers found that 
Google’s spe ech recognition is 13 percent more accurate for men than it is 
for women.  
ASR or AI platforms frequently use feminine voices as digital assistants 
such as Siri, Alexa, and other voice -activated chatbots. However, virtual 
assistants are more likely to understand male users than female users.  
In a different study shared in the article “Bias in Automatic Speech 
Recognition: The Case of African American Language” in Applied 
Linguistics, “researchers Joshua Martin and Kelly Elizabeth Wright list 
numerous cases of systemic bias in their evaluation of various speech 
activation technologies and its often poor interpretation and transcription of 
speech by African Americans.”  


6 | Page JEOPA R D IZ IN G  JUST ICE  AI Action Plan  
Efficient, effective, and equitable solutions will be found when decision -
makers include the knowledge and expertise of stenographers in future 
planning of the best means to capture speech -to-text that depend on 
humans to hear and conceptualize speech rath er than depend on 
predictive speech models and algorithms.  
While all states have court rules related to the people who may administer 
oaths and function as a deposition officer, some states have laws that 
prohibit notaries from providing court reporting services. Over  half the 
states have statutes regulating all facets of court reporting where 
legislatures have found it necessary to regulate the practice of court 
reporting with licensure or certification requirements to protect the public 
safety and well -being.  
However, for many years the litigation arena has seen analog and digital 
recording equipment in courtroom proceedings. For the same number of 
years, transcriptions of those recordings have been littered with inaudible 
and/or unintelligible parentheticals i n addition to unidentified speakers. 
Despite the problems, many court systems have slowly and tragically 
adopted a standard of “adequate” rather than “accurate” for these all -
important records that must stand the test of reliable review over years or 
decad es.  
Although courtroom recording equipment is frequently monitored by court 
personnel who operate under predetermined court standards, this is 
certainly not the universal practice. The recordings themselves are known 
to be largely transcribed by remote employe es or contractors or authorized 
transcriptionists who have no knowledge of the speakers, have no standard 
guidelines on transcript preparation, and have no requirements in place for 
security, chain of custody, or preservation of the actual transcription.  
The process of digital recording does not transfer well from the courtroom 
setting to the regular deposition setting in that there is no universal 
standard or set of requirements related to the equipment used to create an 
audio recording. Unfortunately, re cording and transcription standards that 
do exist are widely diverse and largely unregulated.  


7 | Page JEOPA R D IZ IN G  JUST ICE  AI Action Plan  
The range of digital audio and video files used by multiple companies is 
large and ever -changing, as are the practices for distribution and 
transcription of media. Some digital and video companies are incorporating 
AI and ASR into transcription of files ev en though most court rules do not 
contain specific language allowing either technology.   
The Necessity of Court Reporters vs. AI and ASR America’s justice system 
is founded on the premise of providing fair and equal access and equitable 
treatment to all, and in many circumstances, both in the legal system and 
without, stenographic court report ers and captioners have always 
embraced the concept of fair and equitable access.  
Stenographic court reporters are committed to the rule of law and their role 
in it. In its simplest form, the rule of law means that every person in the 
United States is subject to clearly defined and publicly promulgated, well -
accepted legal standards and  principles that are equally enforced rather 
than subjected to the personal whims of powerful corporations, individuals, 
governments, or other entities.  
The concept also embraces two other foundational principles deeply rooted 
in American jurisprudence: (1) American laws apply equally to all people at 
all times, and (2) no one is above the law. However, a September 2022 
Gallup survey found that just 47 per cent of adult respondents “expressed 
even some trust in the judicial branch of the federal government, a stunning 
20-point drop over the last two years and a 7 -point drop from last year.”37
Reasons vary, but it is safe to say that few within the public und erstand that
transcript integrity and accuracy are foundational to fair, equitable court
decision -making. Individuals charged with determining the future of
people’s lives — from juries to judges — must have total faith that
transcripts reflect the actual stated words and/or testimony of those
involved in or presenting a case.
AI and its subset technologies have no loyalty to the rule of law and no 
ability to perceive and interpret nuance or emotional expression. Although 
exciting in their abilities to achieve tasks such as processing mass data, 
none has the ability (as yet) to provide risk -free and near -total accuracy in 


8 | Page JEOPA R D IZ IN G  JUST ICE  AI Action Plan  
capturing, transcribing, and protecting the words of all people regardless of 
gender, race, national origin, or age.  
In recognizing AI’s serious risks and fallibility, the ABA and many of its 
specialty sections have studied and passed numerous related policies that 
acknowledge innovative opportunities but strongly caution users and 
developers about the real or possible h armful impacts on insurance, 
privacy, and cybersecurity, to name a few sectors.  
A universal thread throughout these statements, resolutions, and reports is 
an urgent call to action to decision -makers that “responsible individuals and 
organizations should be accountable for the consequences caused by their 
use of AI products, services,  systems, and capabilities, including any legally 
cognizable injury or harm caused by their actions or use of AI systems or 
capabilities, unless they have taken reasonable measures to mitigate 
against that harm or injury.”  
Traceability is considered a key element for trustworthy AI. Traceability 
relates to the need to maintain a complete account of the provenance of 
data, process, and artifacts involved in the production of transcripts that 
incorporate an AI model. Without t raceability, AI should not be used in the 
production of certified court or deposition transcripts.

IN SUMMARY  
Emphasis on Accuracy - Error Challenges:  
■ASR systems struggle with legal jargon, overlapping speech, and
background noise, leading to higher error rates compared to human
transcription.
■While the technology boosts speed, ensuring the precision of transcripts
remains a critical challenge.
Quality Assurance:  
■Human oversight is essential to review and correct AI/ASR -generated
transcripts.
■A hybrid model —using AI for initial drafts followed by expert human
editing —is recommended  to maintain transcript integrity, especially in legal
contexts where accuracy is paramount.
Emphasis on Bias  -  Training Data Limitations:  
■AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on; if the
training data is skewed, the  system may misinterpret or underrepresent
certain accents, dialects, or terminologies.
■Bias in AI can result in misinterpretations that affect the quality and
fairness of legal  transcriptions, potentially disadvantaging certain speakers.
■Continuous refinement of AI algorithms and diversified training data are
necessary to reduce  bias.
■Ongoing evaluation is recommended to ensure that the technology
accurately represents all  speakers, regardless of linguistic or cultural
differences.
Emphasis on  Security and Privacy of Sensitive  Information  - Data 
Sensitivity:  
■Legal proceedings contain highly confidential information, making secure
handling of audio  recordings and transcripts critical.


10 | Page JEOPA R D IZ IN G  JUST ICE  AI Action Plan  
■Cloud -based ASR solutions raise concerns about data transmission and
storage outside  secure, controlled environments.
■The possibility of unauthorized access or breaches requires stringent
security measures.
Recommended Security Measures:  
■Implement robust encryption and secure data transfer protocols to protect
sensitive  information.
■Adhere to legal and regulatory standards to safeguard client data and
maintain confidentiality  throughout the transcription process.
Ethical Considerations:  
■In utilizing AI/ASR technology there needs to be a balance of
technological efficiency with ethical  obligations regarding confidentiality,
privacy , and the secure handling of sensitive legal data.
Possible Strategic Recommendations  – Invest in Training and 
Technology:  
■Combine the efficiency of AI -generated drafts with the accuracy of human
review to address  both error and bias issues.
■Ongoing training for court reporters in digital tools and continuous
improvements in AI models  are crucial to minimize bias and enhance
accuracy.
Industry Standards  Must be Established Before Deploying AI/ASR to 
Capture Legal Proceedings : 
■Collaborate with industry stakeholders to develop and enforce guidelines
that ensure AI  systems meet high standards of data security and privacy.
■Encourage research into refining ASR technology, particularly in areas of
legal language  processing, bias reduction, and secure data management.


11 | Page JEOPA R D IZ IN G  JUST ICE  AI Action Plan  
Recommendation: 
■Establish a taskforce to address the emerging legal and ethical issues
related to the potential usage of artificial intelligence (“AI”) in the United
States Judicial System.
■Appoint to the task force individuals who have demonstrated expertise in
the following areas: (A) Official record making process for the judicial
system (B) Court reporting in federal and state court systems.
