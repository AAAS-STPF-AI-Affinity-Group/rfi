 1 Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action 
Plan  
Name of person filing the response: Prof. Andrei Shkel, Associate Dean of Research and 
Innovation  
Organization filing the response: Henry Samueli School of Engineering, University of 
California, Irvine  
Recommended Policy Action  #1: Establish Data Centers that Standardize Data 
Input and Output for Training AI Models  
Description  
High -quality, standardized data is critical for the accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness of 
AI models. Many scientific and technological fields currently lack well -curated, domain -
specific data sources, leading to inconsistencies  and reduced effectiveness of trained AI 
models . Establishing dedicated data centers that provide verifiable, high -quality datasets 
is essential for advancing AI applications across industries. These datasets should be 
publicly accessible to promote transparency and innovation.  
Beyond standardized input data, ensuring that AI model outputs are verifiable is equally 
important. Recent efforts, such as DeepSeek outputs being benchmarked against 
ChatGPT, demonstrate the need for domain -specific verification methods. Developing 
“etalo ns” or reference benchmarks tailored to specific scientific and engineering domains 
will enable robust AI performance assessment.   
Key Considerations  
1. Data Quality Control & Standardization : Implementing standardized protocols 
for data collection, validation, and curation to ensure consistency, accuracy, and 
reliability in AI training.  
2. Strategic Data Collection : Addressing gaps in experimental datasets through 
improved methodologies for data acquisition, ensuring AI models receive 
comprehensive and representativ e training inputs.  
Use Cases  
1. AI-Driven Materials Discovery : AI can accelerate the synthesis of new materials 
by computationally predicting viable candidates before physical validation, 
significantly reducing costs and development time. As the U.S. faces increasing 
global competition in materials science innovatio n, access to high -quality 
experimental datasets is crucial for maintaining technological leadership and 
national security.  
2. AI for Biomolecular  and Cellular Engineering : AI-driven design of biomolecules, 
especially sequence -encoded biopolymers  like nucleic acids and proteins, 
requires access to extensive, high -quality datasets to accurately predict and 


2 engineer desired functionalities. Extensive s tandardized datasets , including novel 
experimental approaches to generate such datasets,  will improve model 
performance and accelerate advancements in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, 
and healthcare.  AI can also be used to  program cells , enabling  them to precisely 
respond to medical treatment targets. Beyond advancing healthcare, AI-driven cell 
engineering will be instrumental for improving food production, by optimizing the 
quality and quantity of crops and livestock.  
Recommended Policy Action  #2: Establish Policies that Facilitate Synergy Among 
Human s, Cyber -Physical System s, and  AI 
Description  
Time series data for machine learning at the edge of cloud computing is essential to 
understanding the dynamic interaction between human and cy ber-physical system s as 
well as to accelerating  the adoption of edge AI for improving individual quality of life and 
socioeconomic impacts.  High-quality, standardized time-series data is critical for the 
accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness of edge AI models. Many scientific and 
technological fields currently lack well -curated, domain -specific data sources , due to the 
proprietary and privacy nature of the data.  Integrating AI with human expertise and 
advanced hardware systems is essential for optimizing manufacturing, national security, 
and autonomous s ystems. AI -driven automation, combined with human oversight, 
enhances efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability in complex environments.  
Key Considerations  
1.Manufacturing  Technologies : Policies should facilitate collaboration between
equipment manufacturers, software developers, and foundry companies to enable
AI-driven decision -making  at the edge . AI -enhanced automation should
complement human expertise to develop new technologies or to improve
productivity, reduce contamination risks, and enhance cost -efficiency in existing
ones .
2.Human -Machine Teaming : Trustworthy AI systems can serve as decision aids in
critical applications that involve, e.g., warfighters  where  situational awareness and
rapid response capabilities  are needed . Policies should promote the integrati on of
data from both humans and autonomous machines (e.g., robots with autonomous
sensors), so that AI can be used to enhance decision -making  and real-time
adaptation to adversarial threats.
Use Cases  
1.AI-Enhanced Semiconductor Manufacturing : Real -time AI-driven robotic
systems, combined with human expertise, can optimize wafer process  flow for
enhancing productivity , improve equipment utilization , and process  defect


3 detection, and reduce material waste  and ensure energy -efficient AI , strengthening 
U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.  
2.Autonomous Systems in National Security : AI-powered autonomous systems
can support military operations by analyzing real -time sensor data, predicting
adversarial movements, and assisting warfighters in dynamic combat
environments.
By prioritizing high -quality data standardization and fostering AI -human collaboration, the 
U.S. can drive innovation, maintain technological leadership, and enhance national 
security.
