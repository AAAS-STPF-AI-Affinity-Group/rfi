General Comment
I think that AI com panies should be allowed to steal whatever they want to use for their m odel only if I am  allowed to steal whatever I
want from  their offices. If they want to use other peopleâ€™s art for their profit, I would like to use their fancy chairs for m y hom e office and
their office space for m y gam es of indoor hockey.
