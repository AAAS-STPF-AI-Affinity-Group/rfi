General Comment
These m ajor com panies with so m uch m oney are dem anding the governm ent of all things step in and m ake it legal to steal our, artists of all
shapes and sizes, work because of what…a hypothetical foreign threat? Our work is so lacking of worth but is worth having a
governm ental body force it to be given away? This isn’t som e great voluntary action for the betterm ent of m ankind garbage. This is theft
for their profit off our hard work without so m uch as a please or a thank you. We don’t m ake content for free use. If we WANTED to do
that we would do that. There would be dialogue. There is none. This is just forcibly ripping our own m aterial from  our hum an bodies and
giving it to a giant corporation to m ake garbage with and being told that we just feel too m uch. Honestly I’m  getting beyond tired and
m aybe just a touch angry at all of this AI garbage. Do better.
