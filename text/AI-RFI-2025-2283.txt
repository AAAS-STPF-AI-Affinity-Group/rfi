General Comment
Generative AI com panies should not be allowed to bypass the laws of the land, nam ely copyright. They should be held liable like
everyone else to create work that is not derivative of som eone else - if they aren’t held liable, then countless Am erican workers will have
their creative work stolen, and they won’t be able to have the financial stability needed to im prove the nation.
