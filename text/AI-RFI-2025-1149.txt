General Comment
As m ore com panies turn to AI to generate product and services, they are collecting greater am ounts of data that has inherent value.
However, this is not tracked in any way.
I propose that, as data is actually a financial asset, that com panies that use AI have to inventory, track, value and protect their data assets,
especially as it com es to profiles of U.S. citizens.
This data asset generates real incom e when used as a part of AI - and as such, should be taxed to support the U.S. governm ent. This data
asset, like any U.S. natural resource, is being collected across our citizens, and should be used to benefit the U.S.
