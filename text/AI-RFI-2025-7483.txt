General Comment
We need to regulate AI. AI is dangerous to the Am erican people. It can be used by ANYONE of ANY political party to censor what
they don't like. It steals from  freelancers and hurts sm all businesses. It hurts the m arket by shutting out com petition. It is used to spread
ANY SIDE'S m isinform ation, things like ai revenge porn, and copyright infringing m aterial. It hurts the envirom ent. This affects
EVERYONE.
