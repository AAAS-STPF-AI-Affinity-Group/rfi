General Comment
First and forem ost:
AI does not have a place in the future of the United States.
AI steals directly from  MY livelihood and the livelihoods of m y m any fellow Am ericans.
AI hype is a great bubble looking to pop any tim e and has been grifting from  the Am erican people.
The training of AI through copyrighted data which those that train the AI have never had rights to should be adm onished to the extrem e. It
is theft and should be held as such. If it cannot be, then copy protection policies as a whole serve no purpose and it serves to show that
we shouldn't have them . It's sim ply black and white: taking the data of the people without rights to do so to train AI is thievery.
