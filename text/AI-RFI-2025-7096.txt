General Comment
Hello,
I am  VERY against Open AI ot any AI that steals from  creative artists. People work all their lives to. Create som ething unique and
innovative. If you have AI encroaching on the creative process of creative people. There will be NO new innovative future. Ai only copies
and spot out subpar results. And AI does NOT help the artist or creative person it cheapest it for operate to save a dollar.if you take
away innovative people we will not only fall behind econom ically but also be stuck in a cycle that never goes anywhere. 
Leave AI out of the creative process. We/will do doing fine without it.
