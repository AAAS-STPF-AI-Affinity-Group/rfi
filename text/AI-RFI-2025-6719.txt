General Comment
AI as it exists today only exists due to the hard work of hum an artists and authors. They are now claim ing they need access to even m ore
works that are owned by the creators that put in years of hard work and persistence in order to be successful. It robs the people that did
the work in order to generate inaccurate shadows of the works they claim  to need. It is absolutely not okay to open the doors further for
this exploitative technology to continue the theft of peopleâ€™s life works.
