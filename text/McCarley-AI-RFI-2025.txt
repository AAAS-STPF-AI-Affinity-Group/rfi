Generative AI is a trap. It is neither artificial, nor intelligent. It is nothing more than a glorified 
chatbot that can kind of, sort of, if you're not looking too close, piece together word salad in a 
way that makes sense, but the results are rarely accu rate and never good. The AI of tomorrow 
cannot possibly be measurably better than the AI of today, because it's already been trained on all of human knowledge. The only thing left to train it on is its own garbage data, which will only make it worse. It is  astronomically expensive to run, and the resources it consumes are 
needlessly damaging the planet in the process. The most advanced AI model that exists costs BILLIONS of dollars more than the revenue it generates. It has no practical use cases, even after 2+ years of development and billions of wasted venture capitalist money. The AI tech bubble will, inevitably, burst, and saddling the US government with that debt will only send us spiraling faster into another recession, if not another Great Depression.  An intelligently run government 
would regulate this technology to prevent the harm its misuse could bring through deliberate disinformation. An intelligently run government would let Silicon Valley waste its own money, rather than propping up an obviously failing industry as it doubles down on useless "innovation." Do better.
