General Comment
In a slide on a presentation from  IBM in the 70s reads “A com puter can never be held accountable, so has increasingly been used to
m ake m anagem ent decisions”
To put a com puter in charge of anything with NO accountability is the worst idea I’ve ever heard. Com puter engineers and scientists
knew it then, and m ost know it now. 
There needs to be a hum an being or a group of hum an beings that can be held accountable for any conclusion this (often very erroneous)
m achine m akes. This is a terrible idea.
