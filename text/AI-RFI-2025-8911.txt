General Comment
Re: “AI Action Plan”
“Artificial Intelligence” (“AI”) aka LLM or Large Language Model is already plagued with hallucinations, lies, fabrications, plagiarism ,
using copyrighted works without com pensation, and stealing of intellectual property by private sector entities. The guardrails should not be
rem oved. The requirem ents are necessary, not burdensom e, to protect intellectual property from  theft without consequences. I oppose
this “Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan” (“Plan”), which was directed by a Presidential Executive Order on
January 23, 2025. I oppose Executive Order 14148. I oppose Executive Order 14179.
