General Comment
Hi, m y nam e is Brandon King. Currently, I have several occupations but am ong them , I am  a m usician and part of a large com m unity of
fellow m usicians, film m akers, painters and others.
I use this space to m ake clear I do not support AI in the future of U.S policy, decisions, and certainly not in what I believe to be fruitless
and insulting archiving of the m aterials of artists.
AI has m ass potential for exploitation of com m unities currently under few protections, com m unities who are using every scrap of tim e,
energy and, yes, m oney, to m ake the world a m ore interesting place. In their place, a world with AI under few regulations, barriers and
lim its would force those people to rethink any creative priority they have, and I will not stand for that to happen.
Sim ply m aking m y voice heard is a terrifying prospect, but an option I will use in the case that it is available to m e. I will not stand by while
thousands - if not m illions of artists - risk losing their sm all spaces of independence because AI developers rely on those artistsâ€™
expressions to m ake secondhand dollars instead of using their influence to protect and com pensate that creativity.
I do appreciate you taking the tim e to read this, thank you sincerely.
