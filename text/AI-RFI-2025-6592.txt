General Comment
Giving LLM's and AI engines copyright-free access to data am ounts to an enorm ous subsidy placed on the backs of the artists, authors
and creators of the content. If OpenAI, or anyone else, cannot find a business m odel to pay a fair price for their access to copyrighted
content, then they should revisit the business plans.
