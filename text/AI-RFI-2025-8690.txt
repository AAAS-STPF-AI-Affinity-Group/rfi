General Comment
I've been a working visual artist for over twenty years, and in the last couple of years I've seen m y peers and profession wrecked by AI
im age generators. 
Data scraping for im age generation should be illegal, on both copyright grounds and unfair com petition grounds. 
These are not program s that "learn" or "create," they reassem ble from  what's fed into them . Nor are they a fair use of that m aterial,
regardless of whether that m aterial is available on the internet. 
Here is an analogy: it's fine to check out and read a book from  the library--the author and publisher had agreed to such a use. It is not a
fair use if I were to run into the library, m ake photocopies of random  pages from  thousands of books, staple them  together, then say "Hey
look, I wrote a book!" and try to sell it at Barnes & Noble.
