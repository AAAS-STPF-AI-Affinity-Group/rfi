General Comment
Do not give ai com panies an inch on copyright.
It wouldn't be good for Am erican innovation if an ai com pany was followed by foreign com panies em boldened to steal Am erican
copyright and undercut our intellectual property.
This isn't just about art, but code and investm ent system s even ai itself could be stolen by foreign adversaries if we allow even our own ai
com panies to use anything copyritten online.
