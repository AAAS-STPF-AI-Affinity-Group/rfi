General Comment
My nam e is Henry, and I am  a graduating senior from  a Western Pennsylvania High School. Recently, I com pleted a project researching
the im pacts of AI on Math Education in 2025, and the current adm inistration's push for lim ited regulations on AI is extrem ely relevant to
this field. My research has led m e to believe that AI is an overall detrim ent to the Am erican education system  and that it should be kept
out of schools. Heavy generative AI usage leads to a reduction in problem -solving ability and critical thinking skills in our youth. Young
people becom ing dependent on the assistance of AI is only am plifying a culture that discourages sustained attention, com plex processing,
and deeper engagem ent with the popularity of today's m edia forum s. Whilst m ass restrictions on AI m ay be seen as an infringem ent of
rights, the reduction of AI accessibility in schools is param ount to supporting future generations of Am erican citizens.
