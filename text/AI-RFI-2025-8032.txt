General Comment
Using the law to shield a claque of scam  artists from  liability for stealing IP is utterly unjustifiable. The US has already lost 'AI dom inance'
to China, who are infinitely m ore brazen thieves. Because theft is the business m odel of LLMs - theft of IP, theft of investm ent capital,
theft of electricity, theft of attention.
