I believe that we are inevitably going to have AI as the next evolution in human histor y. But as with 
every new innovation in the past, going too fast will be disastrous. Our personal priv acy and safety 
are at stake here. Don â€™t put the cart before the hors e when allowing technology an open book. 
Regulations are a necessity that should not be bypassed. Any independen t company forming AI has 
no interest in the individual needs of regular people. It has been my experience that without 
oversight and regula tion these companies will use peopl e as the test subjects for their business 
benefits. The main objectiv e of these companies ar e to make profits and be first regardless of who 
or what may be harmed in the process. Prior to allowing AI into our daily lives there should be the 
personal ability t o control said AI by each individual who uses it. W e as users should be able to limit 
its oversight on how it affects our d aily activities.
