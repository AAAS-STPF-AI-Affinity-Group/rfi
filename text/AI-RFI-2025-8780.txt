General Comment
If a com pany is using m y art to develop a product that they plan to m ake m oney off the back of, they should be required to have
perm ission and a license for that usage. Plain and sim ple. The fact that m y art is on the internet or that there are a bunch of interm ediary
steps taken does should not obscure this sim ple truth.
