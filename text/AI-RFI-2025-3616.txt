General Comment
Regulation of AI Training Data is needed FAR MORE than giving a com pany Carte Blanche to steal the creativity of Am ericans for their
own profit. Do not allow OpenAI to bypass copyright restrictions, and deny them  the ability to violate copyright law as they see fit in
order to profit off of the work of the people who actually create said works.
OpenAI m ay argue, and has done such previously, that they will not be able to exist without free access to everything. I'd say that if a
com pany cannot exist without wholesale theft, then is should not exist.
