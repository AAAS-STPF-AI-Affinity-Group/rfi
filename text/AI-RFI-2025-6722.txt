General Comment
I am  opposed to the creation of an AI action plan. An AI Action plan will open the floodgates to rem oving the livelihood of countless
artists. If creators have no control or agency over their content they have no way of ensuring fair com pensation for their work. Literally
everything our m odern social structures use relies on people being able to hold the creative license for their work. Tv, film , books, even
content creators on youtube and other social m edia will be subject to having their content scraped and used to generate a stream  of
m oney for tech billionaires who have done nothing to earn it. AI as a tool exists and will grow to be so helpful in m any situations, but only
if it is given guardrails that respect privacy and intellectual property. Stop the AI action plan, invest in protections for artists and creators
instead.
