General Comment
The deregulation of AI would be a terrible m istake. AI is m ade from  the creation of real people stitched together, done without any
com pensation toward the parties involved. Com panies that use AI m ust be required to give com pensation to those it trains from , but also
m ust stop any training on data to which they have not been given consent to use. Furtherm ore, stringent laws on AI that could replace
hum ans with consent or com pensation need to be im plem ented.
