General Comment
This technology is already costing Am ericans their jobs as it is. Rem oving any sem blance of restrictions, allowing corporations to steal
anything and everything under the pretense of "innovation," accom plishes nothing but further consolidating econom ic power to a sm all
handful while even m ore Am ericans are left unem ployed. If even copyrighted m aterial is free fodder for generative AI, what incentive does
any Am erican in any creative industry have to m ake anything anym ore? What's the point in trying to win a technological arm s race with
other nations if it com es at the cost of our own people's econom ic and creative wellbeing? Are we to sacrifice all current and future artists'
livelihoods on the pretense of "security"?
