According to  https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/06/2025-02305/request-for-
information-on-the-development-of-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-plan , the goal is to
"sustain and enhance America's AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome
requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation".
These are the wrong goals. The government should be working to protect the environment and
individuals' privacy and livelihoods. AI is used as an excuse to vacuum  up everyone's
information. And generative AI has proven itself to be almost completely useless, at the costof a livable environment. The aim of the AI business is to replace workers. AI will never havethe creativity or intelligence to effectively replace workers, so it will only serve to providecustomers a worse experience, while putting more people out of work, making the country aworse place for everyone.
