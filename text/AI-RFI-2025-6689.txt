General Comment
AI is not the future of Am erica, or not the future of a great Am erica. It steals profits from  people, destroys livelihoods, and creates m ental
laziness. This would give the green light to stealing endless personal, private data from  Am ericans and would be so harm ful. This is bad
and should not be allowed.
