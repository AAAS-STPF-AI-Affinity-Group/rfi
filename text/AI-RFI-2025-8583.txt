General Comment
AI should not have a future if it subverts copyright laws to steal from  artists, m usicians, writers, etc. 
Copyright laws were m ade to stop people from  stealing other's creations, so why should an AI be allowed? Training an AI to steal is still
theft. 
If AI is allowed to m odel itself after copyrighted m aterial, then copyright laws are m oot. 
This would dram atically hurt creatives who are trying to m ake m oney from  their passions. AI should not be a tool to steal from  those who
are already struggling to get by. All this will do is hurt people who pour their heart and soul into creating their works.
