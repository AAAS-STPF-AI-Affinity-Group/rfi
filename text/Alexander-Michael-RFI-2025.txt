If you strain China too much on GPUs they will invade Taiwan and cut the world off from GPUs. 
Either make it so TSMC is completely integrated in the US or arm Taiwan to the teeth.  
GPUs are important but the industry is clearly going to move to dedicated AI chips. The US should 
foster innovation in developing these chips and diversifying away from only using Nvidia chips.  
AGI is an existential threat to humanity. That is not to say that it cannot help us greatly as well. 
However, the US needs to harden our infrastructure. We are hacked every day and there are zero 
days that our enemies can exploit at any time that we don't know about. When our enemies achieve 
AGI this threat will be exponentially worse. Our investment in AI should not only be directly in the 
technology but also in securing ourselves from when it is used against us. The White House should 
make an executive or der to harden our supply chains, water systems, energy systems and all other 
systems that are crucial to this country running smoothly.  
Although limiting China's supply of GPUs may be helpful in the short term, it could hurt us in the 
long term. We need all other countries, especially China, to be reliant on us as much as possible. To 
put it clearly, this allows us to control them. Giving the US a headstart by limiting China in the 
beginning is fine, but when China makes its own GPU technology that rivals the US's, we will be in 
even bigger trouble than when we were selling GPUs to them without restraint. China is obviously 
an adversary and  should be treated as one, however, we need to keep them reliant on us.
