General Comment
Hello. I'm  a graduating senior from  Pittsburgh, PA. For a sem ester-long English course, I researched the im pact of generative AI on
m ental health, and we recently studied the adm inistration's viewpoint on AI regulation. Based on the m onths of research I conducted, I
think that is detrim ental to current m ental healthcare system s. AI algorithm s have im m ense biases and often discrim inate based on these
biases. This leads to unequal treatm ent that could potentially harm  patients rather than assist them . I also found that AI could underm ine
the benefits of person-to-person care that com es with the m edical field. From  an ethical perspective, this raises the concern of hum an
autonom y. If we are to begin relying on robots to conduct assessm ents or act as therapists, there is a large disconnect. More regulation
needs to be put in place to lim it the usage of AI in certain fields. Keeping it away from  patient-doctor interactions is crucial to prevent
these concerns from  prospering. 
Thank you for your tim e and for hearing m y concerns/opinions!
