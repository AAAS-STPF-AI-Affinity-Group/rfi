My name is Ella Bounos and I am a graduating senior from Avonworth High School. I 
researched generative AI's impact on art for a semester course, and recently studied this 
administration's viewpoint of AI regulation. Based on my two months of student resea rch, AI 
should be heavily monitored, especially with continuing advancements in this technology. While 
I agree that AI can be used as a tool to enhance people's work or even help generate ideas, it's 
also stealing other people's work. In my research, I tal k about copyright when it comes to AI and 
art, and one of my sources questions whether copyright, patent, and trademark infringement 
apply to AI creations. In 2022, there was a case of 3 artists whose art styles were stolen by an 
image generator. The 3 art ists weren't aware that the AI was being trained to use their art styles. 
With this being said, I think there should be a copyright infringement placed upon AI and a more 
elevated monitoring system when it comes to AI. Not only does generative AI concern a rtists, it 
can also put them out of business, even if AI generated art isn't considered real art. Please 
consider my concerns, thank you.
