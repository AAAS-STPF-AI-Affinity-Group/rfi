General Comment
AI is a failing technology that does not need to be tested within governm ent,where its daily failures will affect the Am erican public.
Additionally, AI works as a functional plagiarism  m achine, and the governm ent would he liable for countless lawsuits. It is wrong to
engage in theft, as should be plainly obvious.
