General Comment
The efforts of all creatives deserve to be protected. Allowing artificial intelligence to effectively steal it and pass it off as its own is theft,
plain and sim ple. If a person did it, it would open them  up to plagiarism  lawsuits or worse. Why should AI and the folks responsible for it
be any different?
