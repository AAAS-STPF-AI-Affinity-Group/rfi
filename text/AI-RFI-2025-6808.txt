General Comment
I will be sim ple and brief. AI is an abom ination on every conceivable level, a grift as em pty and transparent as the em peror's new clothes.
It is theft, as it requires endless ream s of intellectual property (i.e., works if art OpenAI does not own) to m ake its "content." It is an
environm ental disaster, requiring obscene am ounts of power to produce even the sm allest results. And it's widespread usage will kill
businesses, disenfranchise artists, and create a nightm are m edia landscape where the truth will be harder to discern and act upon than ever
before. Please abandon these plans and think before we allow this nonsense to ruin everything good and decent about this country.
