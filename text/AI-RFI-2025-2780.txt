General Comment
I am  here to plead to you all to keep OpenAi out of artists' work and to not let them  train their m achines on any kind of work without the
proper consent.
Why you m ay ask?
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US because it has m isled the people m ore than inform  them .
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. I'm  not a rich person, in fact I work below poverty but I pay m y taxes
and having som e m achine com e into m y place of work and replace a hum an touch is absolutely evil. To quote Charlie Chaplin, "Greed has
poisoned m en's souls. Has barricaded the world with hate. Has goose stepped us into m isery and bloodshed."
And m ost of all...AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. It cannot do what hum ans can, only m im ic them . We
crave connections, not m achinery.
