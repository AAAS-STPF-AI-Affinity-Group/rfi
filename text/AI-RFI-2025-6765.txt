General Comment
An AI technology action plan should em phasize transparency both in term s of training and m odeling and rigorous ethical guidelines that
punish groups who use generators to pollute com m unication channels, produce counterfeits, or otherwise infringe on the rights of
Am ericans. Care should be taken that these technologies can never be used to obfuscate legal or m oral culpability on the part of their
operators. 
AI has been a boon to bad actors and transparency to ensure datasets are properly licensed and consensual is as necessary as ever.
Scraped training data is obviously not fair use. Generators can be shown to contain their datasets and are not transform ative in a literal
sense. Allowing tech firm s free reign guarantees disinvestm ent and unem ploym ent in the US's culture and m edia landscape, the very
people being stolen from .
