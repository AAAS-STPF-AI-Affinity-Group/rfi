General Comment
This is a terrible idea. I absolutely do not believe that rem oving guardrails on AI, including copyright protections, will m ake the country
safer. This is bad for ordinary Am ericans, artists, and the world. Do not hand all our IP over to OpenAI and Google just because they
asked. Also, why anyone thinks these corporations are actually concerned about national security is beyond m e, they are concerned for
their shareholder value only.
