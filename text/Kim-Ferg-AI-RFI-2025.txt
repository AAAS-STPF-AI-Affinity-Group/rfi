Please consider the human aspect as you develop your plans.
Also, prevent for-profit corporate leaders from having the final say in the lives of the for-living human population. Make the decision for the good of the American people not for the whim of a single electedofficial. 
There will come a time when AI could replace many human jobs and we will have to answer,
