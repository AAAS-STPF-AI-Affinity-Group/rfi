General Comment
This is a terrible idea that is based on theft of the creativity of artists everywhere. It is absolutely disrespectful and not to m ention illegal. It
should rem ain illegal. What these com panies want to do is to be allowed free rein to thievery. They are theives asking to be allowed to
com m it robbery. If these tech com panies want to use people's work for their AI then they should pay hefty licenses from  those artists.
You m ust not allow the tech com panies to steal from  artists. You m ust force these tech com panies to respect the copyrights and rights of
artists who work them selves to the bone to create their vision.
