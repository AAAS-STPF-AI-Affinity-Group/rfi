General Comment
As an artist, AI has shown tim e and tim e again to m e its threat to m y artwork, and the artwork of m y peers. I've seen m odels trained off
of artists without their perm ission, and I've seen people get scam m ed off art "trained" off of the stolen artwork of the artists they're trying
to m im ic. Its a direct threat to our already unprotected way of business. AI m ust be stopped from  ruthlessly scraping the content of artists
just trying to m ake a living. Any content som eone m akes, belongs to them , and it should rem ain that way.
