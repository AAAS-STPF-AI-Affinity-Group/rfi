General Comment
This idea would literally legalize theft. Creators deserve to be com pensated for their work, not to have it fed to AI so AI can take jobs
from  Am ericans m ore efficiently. This will cause m ass unem ploym ent in all creative fields. I thought Republicans actually wanted people to
have jobs, but I guess not.
