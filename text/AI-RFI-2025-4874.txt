General Comment
First and forem ost, this is a waste of m oney, tim e, and effort. If I have to suffer m y taxes going to an ‘action plan’ for som ething both self-
destructive and environm entally destructive as AI, specifically Generative AI, rest assured com plaints will never cease. There is no room  in
the artistic realm  for cut and dry copies of actual works, with no soul whatsoever, to exist. As a m atter of fact, for all the effort being put
into som ething as unhelpful as this, jobs could be created in the industry to perform  at a m uch higher level than any AI ‘action plan’ could
ever facilitate. I hope that whom ever is charged with looking over all of these will actually acknowledge that this is unethical and
unnecessary, as opposed to plugging their ears and pretending like the slop churner 6000 is such innovative technology that sim ply m ust
be used in order to protect busted businesses like OpenAI from  facing the consequences of stupid ass business ventures.
