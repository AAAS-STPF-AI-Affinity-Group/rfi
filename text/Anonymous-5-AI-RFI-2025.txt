I believe AI should be regulated for security reasons. The Federal government or its staff should 
not have any personal or corporate investments in private sector AI, nor should such government 
connected individuals or corporations receive any government f unding or grants for private 
sector AI initiatives or own any AI related stocks. There is too much conflict of interest when the 
Federal government becomes involved in private sector initiatives generating money for their 
own personal gain. AI will become a slush fund for politicians, merely throwing crumbs at their 
constituents as a smoke screen. The Federal government should limit AI initiatives only to 
funding for individual and broader level threats AI can produce against ordinary members of the 
public.
