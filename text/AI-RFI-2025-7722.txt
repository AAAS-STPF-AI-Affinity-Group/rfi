General Comment
(Shad Brooks) Please think about the im plications of allowing AI to dom inate our working population. The following are item s to
consider, in no particular order. 
1. Art - AI is built off of LLMs that use art uploaded through social m edia platform s. There needs to be consideration on copyright
infringem ent with using artist's hard work. Som e of these pieces of art take days of work to perfect, and allowing a LLM free access to
these works can end up in what would equal to theft.
2. Music - sim ilar to art, LLMs can be built upon copyrighted m usic. Please take this into consideration and the im plem entation of any AI
rules or regulations. Any audio from  m usicians should not be used without the explicit consent of the m usicians.
3. Writing - while I have personally used AI in proofreading em ails, especially for clarity, I do feel like LLMs use writing without the
explicit consent of the writers. And any writing that's used without the explicit consent of the writers should not be used in LLMs.
4. Code - I have personally used LLMs/AI to help m e with editing code used for python scripts. However, we need som e way to allow
software developers to m ark their scripts to disallow LLM / AI to scrape this data. Please take this into consideration when developing
any rules or regulations in the context of this public com m ent.
