General Comment
This is a very concerning plan. Artificial Intelligence trained on others' work is tantam ount to stealing. There are no guardrails to prevent
this from  stealing from  people who do not desire to be part of this dataset. Furtherm ore, there is no acknowledgem ent of who's work
goes into this, and therefore no credit will be given to the creator of the original.
