General Comment
This is a m assive and concerning infringem ent on the copyrighted works of journalists, professional authors, and sm all publishers.
Language learning m odels (LLMs) that tech com panies use to train their AI are stealing the original works of online publishers, the
m ajority of whom  are sm all business owners who m ake their living from  digital ads on their websites. Already these LLMs have put
thousands of sm all business owners out of business, and without regulation, this has the potential to destroy tens of thousands of sm all
businesses, as well as large, corporately owned publications who depend on their website ad revenue to pay staff writers, editors,
photographers, and journalists. The ram ifications are widespread and devastating. The Internet needs MORE regulation on AI, not less.
