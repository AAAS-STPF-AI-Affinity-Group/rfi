General Comment
AI is used only for theft and m iss inform ation. These com panies should have no right to use the work of others for thier own profit. I know
countless peoples who's hard work and livelihoods havebeen stolen. AI only hurts real Am ericans. 
While I know this is to discuss the attem pted theft of copyrighted m aterial belonging to the average citizen by AI tech corperations, I
know AI has been used for revenge porn, child porn, m ultiple form s of bullying and harrasm ent, fake political im agery, scam s, and if the
US allows this this will be a disgusting act of violence against its citizens by enabling the worst people possible. We see news of this daily
and it needs to be stopped and not allowing AI to run crazy would protect the people.
