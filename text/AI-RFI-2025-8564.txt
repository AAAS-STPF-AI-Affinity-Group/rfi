General Comment
To Those Responsible,
The delay and subsequent abolishing of any plans to rem ove safeguards against A.I. would be the m ost logical, wise, and innovative
approach when it com es to the use and optim ization of A.I. Hum anity both needs and deserves tim e to establish a positive and efficient
use of A.I. that will preserve our best interests and ability to continue to evolve in profitable ways. Releasing lim its on A.I. could result in
som e extrem ely detrim ental results that could backfire on those who appeal to the unlim ited use of A.I. and could seriously hinder
m ankind's ability to achieve any num ber of its goals and progress.
It's clear this idea is lacking oversight and thorough thought. A new perspective is im perative and worth considering as soon as possible in
order to prevent negative results from  arising. 
I trust the wisest action in this process is to term inate the plan on to use open A.I. without lim itations. Please reconsider your actions to
preserve all what's good and profitable both today and in the near future.
