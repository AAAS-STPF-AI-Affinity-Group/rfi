General Comment
Setting any "creation" engine up to be free from  legal recourse is a bad idea in general: from  stolen copyright m aterials, to the inappropriate
use of people's likeness and voices (from  private citizens to politicians), to the blatant incorrect inform ation that AI is known to present as
fact (i.e. on search engines or chatgpt). 
Generative AI is built off the backs of individuals who in m ost cases have not and do not wish to have their work used to train the engines.
Not only is the work it produces of varying quality but it's also a rehash. There is no actual "creation" happening. Without outside
'influence' it just produces the sam e ideas. AI needs outside creatives, who work hard to create and use those creations to survive. 
If AI is let loose, those creatives are directly hurt. Industries will shrine to those who are sim ply working off the bones of other things,
while the m ajority who worked on those project will see other em ployem ent or suffer. 
I opposed AI being free of legal consequence
