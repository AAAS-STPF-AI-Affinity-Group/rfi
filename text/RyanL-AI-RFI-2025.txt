My name is Ryan Leong and I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US as AI
steals from my livelihood as an American and profits off of theft.   AI is not only overhyped,
but is also incredibly expensive to maintain, a huge waste of resources, for such little profitand little use cases.

generative AI is going to train on copyright material, then the people of the copyright materialmust be properly compensated.
