General Comment
Generative AI has no practical application in Am ericans' lives in its current state. Its lack of regulation m eans that it is effectively theft from
creatives and is therefore robbing Am erican creatives of their jobs. The inform ation it outputs is unreliable and frequently wrong, so it is
inapplicable in schools, data entry, or any field where data accuracy is im portant. There seem s to be no plan to address server and power
costs when we are already in an energy crisis. I believe this will be a case of offloading the cost of a useless toy onto Am erican taxpayers
and therefore do not support this bill in any way.
