General Comment
OpenAI and all constituents sim ilar to OpenAI should operate WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE LAW and should not be given
com plete and open access to do whatever it wants. Under no circum stances should OpenAI and all other relevant corporations be
allowed to operate outside of the laws of copyright or any other laws, rules, regulations, or policies surrounding the protection of art and
any other m aterial that can be given to an AI database. OpenAI and other corporations operating, utilizing, or experim enting with AI
databases should ALWAYS be under the scrutiny of the law, whether those laws are state or federal laws.
This com m ent is vehem ently against giving OpenAI, and all other parties that utilize AI databases, free reign over pillaging and scraping
inform ation from  the Internet to feed their database m odels. This com m ent dem ands that OpenAI, and all other parties that utilize AI
databases, operate under the RULE OF LAW, and if that causes these corporations to fail, then these corporations should have not been
given operational stability in the first place.
