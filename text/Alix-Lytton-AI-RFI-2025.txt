To whom it may concern,
The proposed Development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan serves as a detriment to human creatives
everywhere. Artificial Intelligence has no benefit to the future of the United States of America, as it steals the hardwork of artists domestically and worldwide, acting as a hinderance to those in creative industries by killing jobs. AIwhen used for writing spreads misinformation at a rapid speed and acts as more harmful than helpful in everysituation. The only good that can come of it would be to stop generative use entirely.
Please consider the needs of artists of all kinds by putting a stop to this plan.________________________________All e-mails to and from this account are for NITRD official use only and subject to certain disclosure requirements.
