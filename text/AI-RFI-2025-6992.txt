General Comment
This is a very bad idea. This is theft & will void all copyright laws com pletely. This should not be allowed, if this goes through, every
corporation & artist will just m ove to anywhere else. This will cause a cultural, financial, & brain drain on this nation. They'll m ove to
China, they'll m ove to Canada, Mexico, Europe, or even god forbid, Britain or any other Com m onwealth nations. This needs to be
stopped at all costs or else we will have no country left.
