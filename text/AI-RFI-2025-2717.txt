General Comment
The training of AI on copy-written works without perm ission is a explicit violation of the rights of creators to protect the unique output
they create and such a weakening of those rights stifles innovation. Students get expelled from  colleges for plagiarizing other people's
works, people and businesses get sued and stopped from  selling or m aking products if they are using other people's works, in every other
part of the legal system  copyrights are protected. Why should AI get special treatm ent? If it is im possible for them  to develop AI without
using people's copy-written work without their perm ission, it shouldn't be created. If I said it was im possible to m ake m y own m ovie
studio without having the freedom  to use Warner Brother's m ovie scripts, assets and audio for free and without perm ission then I would
rightly be told that m y m ovie studio deserves to fail then. If it is isn't econom ically viable to create AI without violating copywrite laws, then
that is the m arket deciding that AI shouldn't exist as a profitable business. You can't say that the m arket should decide winners and losers
but then get m ad if it chooses a loser you didn't want it to.
I know that this will be ignored because the United States governm ent is dedicated to doing whatever is the stupidest, m ost evil thing it can
but I will still yell at the top of m y voice to waste every second of it's tim e and every dim e regardless.
