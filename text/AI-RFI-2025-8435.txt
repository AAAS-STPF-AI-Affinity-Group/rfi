General Comment
Do not let OpenAI steal intellectual property by im plem enting these regulations. This is a m atter of national security, but not in the way this
policy presents: relying m ore heavily on LLMs and em powering the corporations that profit off them  m akes the nation m ore vulnerable to
threats foreign and dom estic, not less.
