General Comment
Ai in its current form  violates the rights of all creators on earth. This technology has been allowed to em erge in a com pletely unethical
m atter. To quote the creators of m idjourney and stability ai "you only need to launder the data through a fine tuned codex" 
"you could train on the copyrighted data and just forget you did it. Boom  legal problem s solved forever"
"all the best data is behind firewalls"
There is no reason to tolerate this behavior from  tech com panies. Enforce our rights, do your job.
