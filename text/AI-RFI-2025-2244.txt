General Comment
I believe the ram ifications of generative AI, especially generated freely with no regulation on what can be fed into it, is a m assive danger to
society. We have already seen it in the m ost heinous way, generating pornographic content based on real people, without their consent.
Additionally, as it stands, AI generation is focused and cannot function without theft from  otherâ€™s works.
