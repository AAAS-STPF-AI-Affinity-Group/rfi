General Comment
We cannot allow AI to continue to steal other people's work and get away with it. Personal creation and invention m eans som ething in this
country and for an AI com pany to be able to freely steal said work would destroy the foundation of this country. Innovation and creation
would plum m et because why bother when som eone else can just steal anything they want. AI is a scourge and does not belong in our
futures
