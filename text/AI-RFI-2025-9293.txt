General Comment
The race for AI suprem acy is built on wrong assum ptions, and chasing it is to chase the end of the rainbow; it doesn't exist. Industry heads
at Microsoft and Apple have publicly acknowledged that generative AI is a technology looking for a use case, built on nothing m ore than
hopes and dream s of what it m ight do at the cost of tangible losses in the billions of dollars, and now seeks to burn the extant creative
industry as well by providing creative artists no recourse for violation of their IP rights.
To sum  up, burning the industries that have m ade Am erican cultural touchstones like books, art, and film  just so an unproven technology
can m ake a few people a lot of m oney before its bubble bursts is not only a terrible idea, it's one that will have lasting dam age to the
country, far from  being the savior of Am erican industry speculators wish it would be.
