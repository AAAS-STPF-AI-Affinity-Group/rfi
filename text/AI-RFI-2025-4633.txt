General Comment
Com m enting to voice m y concerns that this sort of technology is going to be used to both put people out of jobs and rob people of their
ability to think/create. I work at a school and I'm  already seeing it happen both in and out of work; students and adults alike are becom ing
overly reliant on som ething that constantly steals, is incorrect, and can absolutely be m anipulated. This technology is not som ething that
should have federal resources conferred to it while we have so m any other ongoing issues as a country.
