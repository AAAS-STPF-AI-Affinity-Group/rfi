General Comment
You realize letting this pass also gives countless people free reign to lie about m aking AI program s and just freely steal the inform ation and
subsequently m ake all the effort towards this innovation crash, right? And trying to undo copyright will m ake it worse, right?
You won't open new doors or im prove the econom y as a take that to other countries, this will sim ply accelerate our own econom ic crash
out. It's probably best you don't sign this into law. People are unpredictable and this law will m ost certainly give those outcom es free
leverage and m ake AI m odels com pletely useless.
