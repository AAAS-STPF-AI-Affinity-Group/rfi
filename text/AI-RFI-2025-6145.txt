General Comment
AI bots have has stolen our work, and the work of our colleagues to train Gen-AI m odels. They regularly scrape our publication with no
com pensation, bypassing our ROBOTS.TXT settings and firewall blocks. This has done explicit harm  to us and the writers who work
with us, and continues to underm ines the hard work of the m any people in the field. At the sam e tim e, it's done irreparable harm  to the
public's overall ability to ensure reliable, sourceable inform ation for factual reporting, and dam aged the public trust in the greater anim e
m edia.
Generative AI is theft and does nothing to ensure prosperity, security, or even stability for anybody. Rather, it harm s all of us in the field
directly, using the m aterials stolen directly from  us to destroy our very livelihood while spitting out barely coherent lies. You cannot allow
AI firm s to steal from  us with im punity.
