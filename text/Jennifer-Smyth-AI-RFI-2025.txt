I am writing to express my concern about OpenAI’s history of and stated desire to violate
copyright law. If I, as a high school English teacher in a cash-strapped public school, cannotcopy entire texts to educate my very real, human students, then they have no business doing itto educate an artificial intelligence.I don’t just practice fair use - I teach it my students to use it, so I find it ridiculous that Mr.Altman is incapable of understanding concepts (like limited scope, transformation, attribution,and a basic requirement to not make money off of someone else’s work) my tenth-gradershave mastered.If his product cannot exist without stealing from artists, writers, and musicians, then perhapshis product should not exist.Thank you,Jennifer Smyth
