General Comment
I am  a writer, and a US citizen since the day I was born.
"AI" does not, can not, have a future in this country.
What the notice refers to as "AI" is not a technology that serves the com m on good so m uch as an all-purpose m arketing brand running
cover for destructive scam s. 
The current im plem entation of these technologies, in the extent that they even exist, is inherently im m oral and a violation of copyright law. 
This docum ent is approved for public dissem ination. The docum ent contains no business-proprietary or confidential inform ation.
Docum ent contents m ay be reused by the governm ent in developing the AI Action Plan and associated docum ents without attribution.
However, I do not give perm ission for this docum ent to be fed to an "AI" database or program . I should not need to say that. But that is
the position you have put for us.
Thank you for your tim e.
