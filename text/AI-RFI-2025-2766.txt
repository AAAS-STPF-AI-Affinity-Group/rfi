General Comment
It's honestly disappointing that the adm inistration is m oving to fight against people's right to their copywritten endeavors, that a basic right
to own your property is trying to be stripped away from  the Am erican People.
This is a m ove to steal from  creatives from  all walks of life for nothing than a quick buck for the bloated tech sector. This isn't a push to
lead in an industry that's im portant, this is a push for m ass theft and the violation of privacy and copyright.
I'm  frankly appalled that people would even consider doing som ething like this, but then I rem em ber that we have an appointed "Crypto
Czar" even though crypto currency, Generative AI, NFT's, all the things that the tech sector is trying to cash in on is nothing but a huge
scam .
When we have a crook running the governm ent, and his billionare friend as the president well....I can't say I'm  surprised.
I'm  not an artist, I'm  not a writer, I'm  not an actor or voice actor, I'm  not even som eone who takes pictures while on vacation. But this is a
slap in the face to everyone that has ever picked up a pen, cam era, or even decided to m ove their body. 
This is theft of the hum an experience for nothing m ore than personal gain by way of stealing that which m akes life worth living.
