General Comment
"Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Developm ent and Use of Artificial Intelligence" is still necessary for our nation! We need good, effective
AI tools based on high-quality, accurate content provided by reliable and properly com pensated creators who consent to each and every
part of it. Even with previous protections in place, AI has been generating unsafe search results for food recipes, household product
chem ical com binations, and other basic hum an-perform ed tasks, for exam ple. And com panies like OpenAI already violate copyright law
and plagiarize the hard, intense, creative and transform ative work that we writers and artists perform . Instead of rewarding them  with
unlim ited access to plagiarize and rem ix anything and everything, they should be held accountable for what they have already stolen and
the dam ages their negligence has caused.
