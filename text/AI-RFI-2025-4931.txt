General Comment
I believe and feel AI has no place in the US. AI is not profitable and its existence continues to further devalue the actual good creative
works our hardworking people put out. AI is beyond overhyped and anyone trying to say otherwise is unable to put their m oney where
their m outh is. Without strict guidelines and guardrails on AI we are sunk.
