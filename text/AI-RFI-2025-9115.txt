General Comment
AI com panies are currently attem pting to sell snake oil and insist they need to be able to use other people's work to m ake m ore snake oil.
There are m any potential uses for these tools, but they are years and years down the line and will probably not use the current approach
which m akes hum an readable lying chatbots.
