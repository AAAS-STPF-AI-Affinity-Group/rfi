General Comment
Generative AI steals from  copyrighted m aterial and will utterly destroy copyright law. It is not hum an and should never be given hum an
rights; rather, we should be boosting hum an creativity by protecting creators' works in all form s, be it drawn, painted, written, or even
voiced. Allowing any AI to steal from  hum an artists, writers, etc. will greatly hinder creativity and the livelihood of creative people
everywhere.
