General Comment
While I personally am  not a digital artist, I understand how im portant art is. How long it takes to do, and how im portant of a profession it
is. From  sim ply taking art com m issions on the side, to art being used in video gam es, TV shows, and m ovies. It takes a lot for stuff to be
m ade and that should be shown off and appreciated. With the ram pant use of AI these days, not only is the creative aspect going away
but the need to use other peoples work is terrible. its a weird gray area to use generative AI for dum b m em es and just for curiosity but to
actively use it for com panies personal gain WITHOUT the consent of the artist they are stealing from  is not okay. 
Com panies can't properly train their AI without STEALING other peoples work to feed the AI. and it should STAY that way.
