General Comment
This AI Action Plan should be cancelled because there is no such thing as "unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents" to AI innovation, and
the requirem ents that private sector com panies claim  to be ham pered by are things like "ask for consent to use artists' and writers' works
to train your glorified autocom plete instead of com m itting m ass theft of intellectual property". AI in its current form  is powered by m ass
theft and is incredibly destructive to the environm ent because of its excessive power and water consum ption required to operate the
com puters for what is ultim ately just a glorified algorithm  and not true artificial intelligence. The developm ent and innovation of generative
"AI" needs *m ore* regulation and requirem ents, not less. It's an industry built on theft of people's works, jobs, and public resources.
