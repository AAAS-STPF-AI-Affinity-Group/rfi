General Comment
AI is a cancer to our society, m urder to the arts, and literally burning our planet alive. It should not be supported in any way. It should
absolutely never be free from  legal action, it should not be allowed to use copyrighted or any other private m aterial. This technology is
garbage and just the pet project of im potent and pathetic silicon valley billionaires and has no value.
