General Comment
I donâ€™t see AI being beneficial to our country and I find it to be a waste of tim e and resources when there are m uch bigger problem s that
need fixing and m ore im portant program s that need attention. Additionally AI has so little regulation and only opens the door to m ore
crim e that will eventually need new legislation in order to com bat. I can only see this as a gateway to further degrade our society, not
im prove it.
