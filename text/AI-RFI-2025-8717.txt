General Comment
I'm  a professional translator, writer, artist, and publisher. So-called "AI" threatens all of m y work. LLMs and their ilk steal copyrighted
works and then turn them  into far-worse sludge, all in the nam e of putting people out of work, all while using huge am ounts of natural
resources. It is sad that we're even considering giving this technology greater com pass to further harm  working people and the
environm ent. Do not allow the ultra-rich to further enrich them selves at the expense of working people. Do not em bolden theft. Do not
encourage environm ental destruction. Oppose "AI" and its harm s.
