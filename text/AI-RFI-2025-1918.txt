General Comment
AI technology has proven to be an invaluable resource that has the potential to benefit people everywhere. However as this new
technology develops, it is im perative that m easures be put in place to ensure its ethical use.
Already several concerns have been brought up within various industries. One concern is the usage of AI by em ployers to screen resum es.
This is a brilliant use of AI technology, particularly for com panies that receive hundreds of resum es to sift through. However it has caused
m any qualified people to lose em ploym ent opportunities, sim ply because they did not have certain buzzwords in their resum e for the AI to
pick up. This technology needs to be further developed so that these potential candidates are not accidentally weeded out due to m achine
oversight.
Another m ajor concern is in how generative AI technologies are trained. It is widely known by now that this process is largely perform ed
by searching the internet for various im ages, with no regard or respect for intellectual property rights. Laws MUST be put into place that
clearly state how generative AI is allowed to be trained, and used. The Am erican people have a right to own the things they create, and it
is being stolen by these com panies to train their AI. This should not be an opt-out service, it should be VOLUNTARY to allow your
work to be used to train AI, whether it be im ages, audio, video, or writing.
