General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the Am erican future. AI steals from  the livelihoods of us all and denies us a creative spirit. AI is over
hyped and is destructive in the long run. It will be a fleeting fad. Copyright is a legal protection and the generative AI has already stolen
enough.
