General Comment
I am  a private artist and am  very concerned about tech com panies attem pt to gut m y copyright protections for the content I create. As
described, the action plan will not only override the protections for m yself and artists like m e, but even the com panies who want to use AI
to their own ends. So long as the justification is 'for training generative AI' no art or inform ation will be considered sacred.
I am  additionally concerned about the environm ental consequences of the use of AI. The am ount of power needed to power the
com putational processes of AI is substantial, including carbon em issions and water usage.
