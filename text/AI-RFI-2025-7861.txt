General Comment
AI is an over-hyped, terrible technology that does nothing m ore than steal works from  artists of all kinds (m usic, art, film , writing, voice
acting and m ore) to output far worse quality works. Its already been proven to be a disaster for com panies like NIVIDIA, and takes far
m ore effort for hum an artists to clean up the AI's output to m ake even barely passable than for the artists to m ake the art them selves at
higher quality with real heart and soul. A stick figure has far m ore artistic m erit than AI's garbage output. AI is also a m assive energy drain
and has been further dam aging the environm ent accelerating the decline of our planet. 
There are also MASSIVE Cyber-security problem s with allowing AI to be unregulated as tim e goes on. Chat GPT outputting dangerous
m isinform ation about a variety of topics, especially in regards to m edical situations, political inform ation, science, and even just basic things
that the AI will just get wrong that could get people hurt or killed. We've also already have seen AI being used to m im ic people's voices,
which is insanely dangerous beyond voice actors and film  actors being screwed over. Som eone can far m ore easily pretend to be you and
steal your identity for fraud, and m ost terrifyingly destroy your life by m aking it seem  like its you doing and/or saying som ething terrible by
m im icking your voice and likeness. 
AI has no positive future on any front.
