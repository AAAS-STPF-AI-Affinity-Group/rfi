Americans have concerns that the entities involved in AI development have no guiderails to 
follow. AI has the ability to be a boon to Mankind, or it' worst enemy. I encourage our leaders to 
keep the tech side on a well defined path that will make AI a sour ce for good. I also encourage 
all models to be available to every American without charge. AI should not only be available to 
people who have financial resources but to every American.
