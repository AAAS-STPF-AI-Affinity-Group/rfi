General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of our society. It's sole creation steals from  the passion and creativity of citizens and
individuals deserving of credit and com pensation for their hard work. Without proper com pensation to these creators, AI learns and
provides content through theft, and that is som ething I refuse to support, and will fight against until m y voice is hoarse.
This plan purely seeks to profit off stolen goods, and ruins the opportunities for business and networking from  the hardworking artists
deserving of recognition.
