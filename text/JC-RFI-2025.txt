While our administration is currently in the good graces of tech, with unregulated Ai Elon Musk 
can replace the governments power as he has the face and voice of anyone he wants. Ai has the 
power of disruption (not a good thing despite silicon valleys fasc ination of the term). News cant 
be trusted. Social cant be trusted. At some point ruining all trusted sources will cannibalize this 
admonostrations efforts tp create a false world. Trump is giving way to his replacement. He has 
built the ramp and lubricate d the wheels for all his efforts to usurp him as the jackals he 
surrounds himself with realize he stands on a cliffs edge. I understand he does not act in the 
interest of humanity, as he has worked extensively to undermine it. I hope he will at least have 
enough self preservation to put in regulations, if not for us them him.
