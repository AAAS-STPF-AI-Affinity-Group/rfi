GPU Lending Foreign Aid


Foreign Aid 2.0: Sovereign AI Demands Sovereign Wealth
Vantage Data Centers is building a 10-building campus on top of a former Ford engine plant in 
Wales. What this symbolizes for American industry is up to you.
President Trump’s creation of America’s first sovereign wealth fund (SWF) offers a pivotal 
opportunity to deploy market-driven alternatives to legacy foreign aid models. The timing could 
not be better. States and governance entities globally recognize the strategic importance of AI, 
with England, France, the EU, and South Korea a few of many betting big on sovereign AI and 
local data centers. Where nations see their futures etched in silicon, capital markets have become 
diplomatic channels.
Entity Planned Sovereign AI Investment
England $17 billion
France $142 billion
EU $21 billion
South Korea $37 billion
These projects demand lots of cash, and lots of GPUs from those willing to export them. Luckily 
for the US, we have both. By leveraging a small portion of our $5.7 trillion asset base, a model 
of foreign aid done right should invest in mission-critical, strategically leverageable projects 
around the world, starting with data centers. By financing AI buildouts in exchange for pro-
American stipulations, this model double dips by securing both strategic concessions and 
influence over war-capable GPU assets.
In addition to voracious appetites for outside capital, data centers offer cash flowing, real estate 
and utility-like investment profiles ripe for collateralization, ratings, and large-scale lending 
projects. These stipulation-heavy investments would be the tip of the spear for American 
Forward-Operating AI: a framework to deliver in-demand American GPUs while using proof-of-
location measures to prevent transfers to our rivals, driving aligned innovation and continued 
exports while controlling proliferation where necessary. And not all countries have the budget to 
stand up multi-billion dollar private-public partnerships, meaning the SWF can make sure that 
capital poor, strategically important states don’t miss out on the party.
In addition to typical AI training and inference functions, such centers could serve other mission-
critical cloud functions, like healthcare and financial services. This would ensure that host 
nations—particularly in critical regions like Africa, Eastern Europe, or Southeast Asia—are 
integrated into a global network anchored in U.S. technological leadership. As with NATO, 
interoperability will be the name of the game, and cross-command training, best practice sharing, 
and meeting-of-the-minds-type joint exercises will help to incorporate our partners into a new 
AI-industrial-complex favoring the new pro-freedom digital bloc.
Funding aligned compute through the SWF approach tackles two direct problems: controlling 
rivals’ access to American GPUs and the legacy, swampish models of foreign aid that dominate 
today. The SWF would profitably address an overwhelming capital need; ensure technological 
and diplomatic lock-in by deploying directly into critical, aligned infrastructure; and maintain a 1

major increase in US exports. As opposed to export quotas, which suffocate America’s reborn 
GPU startup ecosystem and nurture Chinese GPU innovation, this approach allows the US to sell 
as many GPUs as it wants to whoever it wants while driving long-term economic impact for 
partner countries. 
Implementation and Immediate Use Cases
How might this look in practice?
In resource-rich Zambia, a data center project by could be tied to privileged or exclusive U.S. 
access to cobalt and copper— materials critical to advanced electronics and AI hardware. This 
model not only would create an aligned tech hub in a region traditionally dominated by Chinese 
investments but also inject a measure of fiscal discipline and transparency into aid.
A SWF-funded data center cluster in Warsaw could replace outdated Russian-made systems with 
U.S. technology, integrating platforms like GE Vernova’s AI supervisors to secure 
communications and power critical NATO operations. By anchoring strategic infrastructure in 
these countries, the U.S. can counterbalance Russian influence in the region while reinforcing its 
own bloc.
In Southeast Asia, a data center corridor in Indonesia could serve as a linchpin for American 
Forward Operating AI in SE Asia. Such a project could mandate that only U.S.-approved 
hardware and software be used—explicitly excluding Chinese vendors like Huawei and ZTE—
and require data localization measures that protect sensitive information. In doing so, the U.S. 
would create a digital bulwark in a region where Chinese investments have proliferated, offering 
a clear, attractive alternative that promotes the US and Indonesia’s shared interests.
To operationalize this vision, the SWF should consider a blended finance model. Direct equity 
investments could fund minority stakes in these data centers, sharing in the profit streams 
generated by colocation fees and GPU-as-a-service revenue. Low-interest loans through entities 
like the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or the Export-Import Bank 
could provide additional debt (the majority of a data center’s capital stack), contingent on host 
nations’ adherence to U.S. trade and technology stipulations. Public–private partnerships with 
tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle would further amplify these investments, 
injecting technical expertise and reducing deployment risk.
This multi-pronged approach allows for greater agility and is vanilla enough for traditional 
financial institutions to participate. By concentrating on Tier 2 nations—countries with moderate 
geopolitical alignment and high developmental needs—the U.S. can expand its sphere of 
influence and preserve one of the few areas where we are still a primary trade partner. 
Give a country a GPU, it will have a GPU for 5 years. Force a country to learn how to 
make its own GPUs… 
This approach rejects the assumption that we must choose between a GPU monopoly and 
intelligent, measured AI proliferation. Legacy Biden-era controls throw out the baby with the 2

bathwater: stifling U.S. competitiveness, alienating key allies, and demanding a Huawei of GPUs 
to step up and meet demand where our quotas leave our allies wanting more. The Huawei point 
is critical: we should not, cannot create the need for, then protect from US competition, the 
Huawei of GPUs. The SWF-led data center solves these problems productively and sustainably, 
utilizing tried and true financing strategies alongside the latest tracking technologies and good 
cold diplomacy to strike the appropriate balance. The ability to monitor GPU locations and 
punish undesired transfers means American technocapital can bring trading partners closer where 
our current policies alienate them.
Financing the Next American Century
China’s Digital Silk Road and proxy conflicts with Russia and Iran pressuring American 
interests abroad raise important questions about the US’s ability to fund the defense of its 
interests. The SWF-based model offers a way for the US to get paid to defend them. Forward 
Operating AI advances American soft power and trade interests in a way that is neither coercive 
nor wasteful and bureaucratic.
The alternative—continued reliance on handwavy export controls and conventional foreign aid 
strategies—will fail to meet its objectives and leave the U.S. increasingly sidelined in the digital 
age. Data centers, and the GPUs housing them, are the decisive opportunity to regain lost trade 
balance around the world.
This is not some wonkish thought experiment. The data center opportunity is a very real, multi-
billion dollar invitation for the US to adopt an aid model that reinforces our interests, offers our 
allies an aligned path to long-term growth, and secures America’s long-term technological 
leadership — one B200 at a time.3
