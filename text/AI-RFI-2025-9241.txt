General Comment
I am  deeply concerned about the current direction of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the tools released in the past few years have
grown at an unprecedented rate and have dam aged the livelihoods of freelance and independent workers. Also, the econom ic downsides
of AI significantly dwarf the benefits (if there are any benefits).
1. ChatGPT cannot think or experience life like a hum an. Any chat output is sim ply a nonsensical conglom eration of hum an-written text, it
frequently m akes errors, and it can grab copyrighted text without perm ission or credit (plagiarism ).
2. Diffusion m odels like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E take copyrighted im ages and art pieces to generate new im ages. This is incredibly
dam aging to the livelihoods of hum an artists who spend their tim e in school learning the craft.
3. These AI m odels use an unnecessarily huge am ount of water and energy, causing m assive dam age to ecosystem s.
I please urge you to reconsider this plan.
