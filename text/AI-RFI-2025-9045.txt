General Comment
Individual copyright deserves to be respected, and allowing AI distributors to have broad protections will harm  consum ers by creating
m onopolies, elim inating the jobs of creatives, and ensuring that people will use this technology as a crutch and not a tool. Please don't
allow AI com panies to use our data- it could also pose a national security risk.
