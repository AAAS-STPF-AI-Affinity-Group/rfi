General Comment
AI, just like m usic, m ovies, prints, and any sort of m edia and literature needs to have the sam e rules applied to it. Copyright should be
applied to any usage of AI, as it grows by scrapping for inform ation created by other sources without asking explicit consent from  those
sources if they want to be scrapped or not. In order to prevent AI from  stealing that hard earned work of those who m ake a living off of
what they create, laws need to be put into place to curb how AI is used and developed. Do not let this plan succeed.
