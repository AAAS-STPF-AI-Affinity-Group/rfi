General Comment
Mainstream  AI is not good. The current algorithm  is not good, it takes too m uch resources for it to produce an output. It inhibits hum an
creativity by stealing from  everyone. I would consider it a plagiarism  algorithm . People won't be able to tell the difference between AI and
hum an work and things will go bad when we becom e too dependent on it. AI will train off of itself which will cause polarized results,
which will give m uch m ore room  for error.
Com panies will sell AI garbage because people can't tell the difference. Even if you m ay feel that is okay, this is lim iting what the hum an
touch can do, like placing a ceiling. AI only knows from  what already exists, only hum ans can give it new inform ation. If we teach
everyone to rely on AI for inform ation, this will greatly decrease how m uch new inform ation we gain.
I would like for all AI generated content to be m arked as AI. Everyone should be able to distinguish AI from  hum an content so that we
can tell how real som ething m ay be. I would also like for there to be a lim it to how m uch som eone can generate. AI can do a lot for
som eone, but we cannot be dependent on it. And we don't understand the m agnitude of the long term  usage of AI.
