General Comment
I will present and elaborate on three m ain points for m y public com m ent:
-- I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
It is extrem ely susceptible to abuse, as has been seen with regards to court cases using lawyer statem ents that m ake reference to other
court cases that sim ply do not exist, as the references were drafted up through the use of AI. The sam e can be said for the creation of
resum Ã©s and translations of foreign docum ents.
-- AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
Databases are rife with stolen and plagiarized content through scraping m ethods, as well as sam pling from  standard users of the internet,
who talk about copyrighted intellectual properties. With regards to art, opt-out databases are stealing by default, subm itting paid-for and
platform -exclusive content of artists without seeking perm ission in any form , as well as subm itting the works of the deceased without
contacting the legal holders of the works.
-- AI is overhyped and is being advertised to the eyes of the Am erican public with m isinform ation.
I believe this point is self-explanatory. An algorithm  is no true, or even decent, replacem ent for hum an oversight. AI sim ply m agnifies the
pitfalls of autom ation.
