General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. In fact, I believe generative AI is a m ajor threat to national security and needs to
be outlawed altogether, for m ultiple reasons.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI technology uses vast am ounts of energy resources that will be even
m ore devastating to the planet if it is allowed to continue. AI contributes to the spread of m isinform ation and has the potential to be used
to falsify evidence. In extrem e cases, AI opens the potential for sexual predators to com m it acts such as "rem oving" the clothes off a
picture of som eone, leading to an increase in AI-generated child pornography and revenge porn and creating extrem ely dangerous
situations, not to m ention intense m ental harm  to those affected.
I strongly encourage the governm ent to not let OpenAI use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI, and instead consider enacting laws to
prohibit the use of generative AI before it becom es an even bigger threat to national security.
