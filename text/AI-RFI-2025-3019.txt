General Comment
YOU ARE LEGALIZING THEFT FOR CORPORATIONS. YOU ARE ALLOWING CORPORATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE
WORK OF ARTISTS TO SURVIVE TO STEAL FROM THOSE ARTISTS. THIS SYSTEM WILL STARVE THE CREATORS
REQUIRED FOR IT TO SURVIVE, AND THEN THE SYSTEM ITSELF WILL DIE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT EXCEPT SHORT
TERM PROFIT FOR A SELECT FEW, AND DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIETY AND CULTURE AS A WHOLE.
