General Comment
As an artist, I am  very m uch against the developm ent of generative AI technology as it is actively stealing from  m y livelihood. It is of
utm ost im portance that people who create for a living still have that ability to do so and not be undercut by a technology that will not
deliver results as intended. While AI m ay have a place in the autom ation of repetitive tasks, generative AI has no place in a world where
hum an creativity far outshines anything that can be generated by a prom pt. From  a consum er's perspective, AI being shoehorned into any
technology is a m ajor turn-off and not what anyone asked for, especially if the results often end up in hallucinations or com pletely false
inform ation. Please reconsider funding this push for genrative AI technology, it is not som ething that we asked for, nor is it a feature that I
personally feel is useful in any way.
