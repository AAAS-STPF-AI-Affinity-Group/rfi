General Comment
The technology often referred to as Artificial Intelligence (AI) as it applies to artistic endeavors such as writing and the visual arts, is not a
valid structure, and stifles creativity. It is, quite literally, a plagerism  m achine, that steals the worlk of others to create a significantly inferior
secondary product. I believe that as it stands, where the varied AI com panies such as MidJourney and others are allowed to use
publicized work to feed their data sets, is a disasterous structure. It will harm  our creative output and place the United States in a terrible
com petitive poosition.
AI can have positive uses, such as processing datasets and predictive analysis in research and scientific applications, but it is disasterous in
the creative arts.
Please restrict AI usage in creative endeavors to the use of m aterials that are Public Dom ain; creators should not have to fear that their
incom e source will be stolen by those too lazy to learn how to produce their own art and writing.
