General Comment
This will not be in the best interests of us Am ericans especially of that of our own creatives, that giving AI com panies the leverage to take
whatever they want to fuel their m achines will not bolster any sort of m eaningful progress. If such the case that they wanted content to use
for their training, they should fairly com pensate such creatives for their hard work.
