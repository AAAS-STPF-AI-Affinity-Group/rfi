General Comment
You m ust be really insane to think that allowing open AI to have all of your citizens inform ation to be used without their consent especially
if som ebody is a m inor and to be targeted with solicitous ads for som ething that is very explicit for adults. let alone ideas for using
som eone's voice or general identity for capital gains without com pensation or concent. Including yours.
