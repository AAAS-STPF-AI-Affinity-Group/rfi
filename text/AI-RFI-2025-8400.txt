General Comment
AI steals from  artists, authors and all of us and profits off this theft. If it cannot be solvent on its own it holds no place in the future of the
US. 
AI also consum es far m ore resources than it gives back; these resources are better utilized by people. 
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the Am erican public.
