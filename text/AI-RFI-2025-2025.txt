General Comment
I feel as though AI is being used frivolously and dangerously and it needs to both be heavily regulated and lim ited. There is a place for AI
in research to help collate large collections of data, but it feels that AI is being used instead to deny qualified applicants jobs based on
ridiculously high criteria and to force artists out of a job due to generative AI.
