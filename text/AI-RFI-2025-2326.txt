General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica.
GenAI m odels are destructive to the environm ent and energy intensive for very little hum an gain.They displace current jobs and are often
inaccurate tools that require extensive oversight to be effective.
Furtherm ore they scrape content from  skilled workers in a way that violates the individual's IP rights with very little recourse for rem oval
from  GenAI m odels. GenAI com panies currently have very little oversight. We should be m oving to create ethical oversight for these
com panies, not lessening regulations.
