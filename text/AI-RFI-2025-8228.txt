General Comment
AI technologies like ChatGPT, open-AI, Dall-E, et al present false inform ation as true on a regular basis. They fail to do the m ost basic
arithm etic operations and get worse as the com plexity of the prom pts increase. They steal creative work from  people and use it to
generate inferior output devoid of context, beauty, and utility. They do all this inferior work at an em barrassingly high cost.
