Introduction  
The key to America’s dominance in AI is the development of AGI 
(Artificial General Intelligence) that goes far beyond typical LLMs such 
as OpenAI and DeepSeek in terms of capability and energy efficiency. 
If the Federal Government and U.S. Big Tech can ach ieve those dual 
goals, it will be very difficult for foreign adversaries to catch up.  
While DeepSeek roiled the markets and the U.S. Big Tech and energy stocks with its more efficient and specialized “Mixture of Experts” 
methodology vs. OpenAI’s more consistent “Dense Transformer” 
approach, AGI will be significantly more disruptive.  
A Congressional Commission has recommended a “Manhattan 
Project” to develop AGI with public- private cooperation , but m ost AI 
leaders predict that AGI is still years into the future . 
Meanwhile,  a company in Texas named MythWorx has already 
developed a  proven AGI capability. Its powerful AGI platform  has been 
in development over the past 27 years  and is just now emerging from  
stealth mode , having been working on multiple  DoD contracts  over the 
past two years .  
Exploring the capabilities of a known AGI platform provides insight 
into how AGI can be leveraged to increase U.S. competitiveness.

Policy Refinement
AGI provides the strongest engine to unleash the power of free 
markets, world -class research institutions, and entrepreneurial spirit. 
Additionally, to maintain world AI leadership, the United States must 
“steal a march” to further develop AGI so neither ideological bias nor 
engineered social agendas has a chance  to stunt its potential. With that 
in mind, we recommend the following policy to enhance action plans that gain and maintain America’s global AI dominance and to promote 
human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.  
Policy:  The United States will promote and maintain global AGI 
dominance.  
a. Action Plan Item: Throughout 2025, apply the ARC -AGI
version 2 benchmark leader results (see https://arcprize.org/)and aggressively resource top contenders to provision and
deploy AGI’s power across our government, industry, an d
academia.
b. Action Plan Item: Fo
cus on the compute time and power
requirements of the top ARC -AGI test performers to identify
the most efficient AGI platforms to ensure scalability and
resource efficiency. Real AGI will require far less compute
power than current AI platforms.
c. Action Plan Item: Focus on top ARC -AGI test performers that
are capable of running on domestically -produ ced
neuromorphic CPUs to reduce reliance on foreign GPU chipproduct ion.
d. Ac
tion Plan Item: By January 2026, develop and execute
further AGI benchmarks to expand the scope and recognition
of AGI capability. Aggressively pursue and resour ce
contenders to further provision and deploy AGI’s power acrossour government, industry, and academia.

Background
First, it’s important to explore OpenAI vs. DeepSeek  on how they 
approach their LLM strategy  and why the market reacted the way it did 
to DeepSeek’s introduction: 
OpenAI  OpenAI’s ChatGPT is like a librarian who has read 
all the books in the library before a question is asked and then gives an answer based on the vast quantity of books it has read, highlighted, and bookmarked. This approach requires more time and power before the question is asked, but uses less time and power while answering. Hence, OpenAI’s time-consuming and expensive process requires an enormous amount of electricity-hungry Nvidia computer chips to read those books in advance. 
DeepSeek  DeepSeek’s R1 chatbot is like a team of expert 
librarians that haven’t read all the books, but are trained to hunt out the right book within a specific field of expertise for the answer after a question is asked. This approach requires less time and power before the question is asked, but uses more time and power while answering. Hence, DeepSeek’s shortcuts help it train AI at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI and competing models.

However, the introduction of AGI will be a significant  leap forward in 
capability given the following difference : 
AI AI refers to task-specific systems that can 
perform intelligent functions like language processing, image recognition, or automation but lack general reasoning. AI operates within predefined rules and training data but does not possess human-like reasoning or adaptability beyond its trained scope. 
AGI  AGI is a form (currently thought of by most as 
hypothetical) of AI with human-like cognitive abilities, capable of learning, reasoning, and adapting across any task without training. AGI, if achieved, would represent a true digital mind with self-awareness and general problem-solving skills.

1 https://www.uscc.gov/annual-report/2024-annual-report-congress  The Commission recommends: 
Congress establish and fund a Manhattan Project-
like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capability. AGI is generally defined as systems that are as 
good as or better than human capabilities across all cognitive domains and would surpass the sharpest human minds at every task.

The Test for Real AGI 
The industry -defining test of AGI is the ARC -AGI test2, which assesses 
AGI capability with hundreds of novel and unique puzzles designed to 
be easy for humans to solve, but difficult for AI to solve.  
To fully grasp the significance of real AGI, one AGI platform, MythWorx, 
achieved a perfect 100% score on the ARC -AGI -1 test without any pre -
trainin g. By contrast, the second highest score is currently held by 
OpenAI’s o3 chatbot at 87.5%. OpenAI’s platform required pre -
training  on 75% of the puzzles  and i t’s notable that the time and power 
requirements shown below did not include all of the pre -training effort, 
but only the test taking effort.  
The potential of AGI (as demonstrated by MythWorx) compared to the 
current standard of AI in terms of pre -training requirements, compute 
time, and compute effort is highly significant and highlights the importance of the need for the U.S. to rapidly advanc e AGI capability.

The AGI  Difference  
Parameters and Impact on Compute Effort:  AGI platforms such as 
MythWorx stand apart from traditional AI models by overcoming the 
inherent limitations of pre -trained models. Unlike traditional LLMs, 
MythWorx does not rely on static model s, instead utilizing dynamic 
learning processes to enhance contextual understanding, emotional 
intelligence, and adaptability in human -machine interactions.  
MythWorx dynamically adjusts its parameters in real time, leading to substantial reductions in energy consumption. This efficiency not only 
makes MythWorx more scalable for various applications but also 
positions it as a sustainable AI solution in an era where computational 
cost and environmental impact are growing concerns. 
Knowledge Graph and Emotional Intelligence:  With a comprehensive 
and continuously updated knowledge graph, MythWorx delivers more 
flexible and natural responses than conventional AI models. This 
adaptability enables deeper user customization  and higher  levels of 
contextual awareness and emotional intelligence. A key differentiator for MythWorx is its superior contextual understanding and human -like 
responsiveness. The system’s advanced knowledge graph allows for deeper comprehension of nuanced conversat ions , making 
interactions more fluid and personalized. Unlike conventional LLMs, which generate responses based on statistical likelihood, MythWorx 
actively interprets intent and emotion, enabling more natural and 
engaging exchanges.  
No Labels and No Bias:  Unlike LLMs that require extensive labeled 
datasets, MythWorx learns dynamically without the need for predefined labels, significantly reducing data preparation time. 
Traditional AI models are prone to inherent bias due to training on 
curated datasets, whe reas MythWorx mitigates bias by continuously 
adapting to new information and evolving its responses. Additionally, 


9 while LLMs often face functional constraints tied to predefined 
architectures, MythWorx operates without such limitations, ensuring 
greater flexibility and responsiveness.  
Contextual Continuity, Persistence, and Capacity:  MythWorx also 
outperforms LLMs in terms of token context and processing capacity. While conventional models are limited by a fixed token context 
window, MythWorx dynamically extends its memory, allowing for more 
comprehensive and coherent long -form interac tions. The system’s 
ability to recall past interactions in real time enhances its contextual continuity, making it particularly valuable in applications requiring 
persistent memory and adaptive learning. Un like static LLM 
architectures, which demand significant storage for pre -trained 
weights and models, MythWorx employs a more efficient, storage -
conscious approach that optimizes memory use without sacrificing performance.  
Flexible Architecture and Increased Security: MythWorx is built with 
an advanced platform architecture that ensures seamless deployment across various environments. Whether implemented on cloud -based 
systems, edge computing devices, or secure enterprise environments, MythWorx adapts to different operational demands with minimal 
reconfiguration. This cross -platform compatibility, combined with its 
low computational overhead and real -time adaptability, positions 
MythWorx as a transformative AI solution for or ganizations seeking 
superior intelligence, efficiency, and scalability.  Any AI must operate 
from a standpoint of “security first .”  MythWorx incorporates advanced 
cybersecurity capabilities by design to ensure that all interactions 
remain safely secured.  Unlike other approaches, MythWorx integrates 
these capabilities from the operating system level through to the AI, 
creating an unsupervised,  automated and continuously learning 
system to intelligently address the continuously evolving threat landscape.

About MythWorx
The Launch : The MythWorx chief scientist is a brilliant savant and 
software engineer who  wanted to replicate the functionality of the 
human brain , specifically in the style of how he learned. He began 
writing the code for what has grown into MythWorx in 1997, well before 
the term “AGI” came into use.  
Growing the AGI Creation Team : The chief scientist was eventually 
joined by other engineers and as the AGI platform became more and 
more capable, it began to develop code on its own to expand its 
capability within our  safety guardrails. The AGI platform  has since 
birth ed new, much more efficient versions and is now on its fourth 
generation. The team has since expanded its expertise , but most 
coding is done by the AGI platform itself.  
Adding Advisors and Investors : The company added critical legal, 
financial, and leadership to the team over the past few years, but has 
continued to operate in stealth mode as it rapidly expanded its 
capability. The company is funded by the leadership team, which 
includes the GP of a global venture capital firm , angel investors , and a 
cleared Defense professional and AI investor . The firm has also been 
funded by revenue from past wor k with DoD . 
DoD Projects: The  firm has been deeply engaged with a large DoD 
contractor and is currently forming a JV with the firm  to expand the 
relationship.  
Commercial Availability: MythWorx is available for master license 
agreements or JVs with the U.S. Government, DoD, and U.S. Big Tech to ensure the U.S. can significantly extend and maintain its AI lead over the 
rest of the world.
