 Our Mission:  Heidi AI’s mission is to provide every student with access to their own personal 
supercomputer, ensuring that all students, regardless of their economic background s, have the 
tools they need to succeed and reach their full potential.  
Heidi for Grades K -12 & Higher Education  
Your Cloud -Based Personal AI Supercomputer for Grades K -12 & Higher Education  
Introducing cutting -edge technology into high school classrooms and higher education institutions 
can be daunting. Schools often lack access to high -performance computing (HPC) resources and 
AI infrastructure, and building or maintaining such infrastructure can be prohibitively expensive. 
Educators face challenges  in integrating computational tools into their curricula, from accessing 
preloaded datasets to finding software that bridges technical complexity with student -friendly 
learning environments. Heidi helps future -proof technology and will support quantum computing 
when perfected.  
Heidi for Grades K -12 and Higher Education  is a cloud -based, SaaS supercomputing platform 
designed to make HPC & AI accessible and affordable for educational institutions. Heidi leverages 
powerful infrastructure, preloaded datasets, and educational tools to help students simulate real -
world phenom ena, build AI applications, and explore advanced computational concepts. With 
partnerships that include leading scientific organizations, some funded by grants from the US 
Department of Energy, Heidi ensures educat ors and students alike are equipped with world -class 
resources to achieve hands -on learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics —all 
at an accessible per -student annual price.  
Heidi’s cost per student is less than the cost of a textbook. Heidi also integrates with on -premises 
data centers.
