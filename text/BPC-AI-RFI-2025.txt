I.Data Centers, Energy Consumption and Efficiency, Hardware and Chips
BPC’s AI and Energy Project  is actively exploring bipartisan policy opportunities at the 
intersection of AI, energy, and infrastructure. We are committed to forward -looking solutions 


2 that meet AI’s growing electricity demands and accelerate AI infrastructure development in 
the United States.    
In February 2025, BPC published Electricity Demand Growth and Data Centers: A Guide for the 
Perplexed, which examines the accuracy of data center electricity demand projections and their 
implications for policymakers. The report determines that data centers will likely account for 
up to 25% of expected electricity load growth nationally through 2030, with  the remaining 75% 
being driven by onshoring of manufacturing and increasing electrification of transportation, 
heating, and industrial processes. It is also important to address future uncertainties from 
advancements or changes in computing efficiency, ma nufacturing production capacity, and 
demand for AI products and services.   
BPC recommends the following actions for addressing the increasing needs of AI, energy 
efficiency, and buildout of critical infrastructure:   
• Advance efficiencies in AI chip technology and data centers. Direct the Department of
Energy (DOE) and other federal agencies to invest in advancements that improve the
energy efficiency of data centers and next -generation chips. These innovations will
support the expansion of critical infrastructure in an increasin gly digitized economy

• Promote low -carbon power procurement for data centers. Foster DOE partnerships with
data center operators to explore advanced nuclear, geothermal, carbon capture, and
other clean firm power sources. Leveraging low -carbon solutions will help ensure a
resilient power supply strategy that meets growing national e nergy demands, supports
continuing AI advancements, and upholds U.S. global security and competition
priorities.
• Incentivize utility and data center expansion.  Establish grants and targeted tax credits
to accelerate investment in generation capacity, transmission upgrades, and
cybersecurity enhancements. A federally supported model that incentivizes states to
accommodate new data center load will help keep the U .S. energy system resilient,
affordable, and adaptable to increasing electricity demands. Reducing risks and
supporting the development of new energy solutions can further strengthen these
efforts.
• Develop standardized metrics for data centers . Task the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), in collaboration with DOE and industry stakeholders, with
developing clear, standardized frameworks for measuring data center computing
efficiency and power usage. Current measuring methods ar e imperfect, and no
standard metric currently exists. Metrics for resource usage and efficiency would help
policymakers and industry stakeholders better manage energy resources used by
rapidly expanding AI wor kloads. A clear, standardized framework, combined with
voluntary reporting, would also improve future energy demand forecasts; enable long -


3 term planning benefits for industry, utilities, and the public; and enhance U.S. global 
competitiveness.   
• Streamline key infrastructure buildout support for AI Energy Zones. Develop a strategy to
streamline approvals in federally designated areas to enable rapid buildout of data
centers powered by clean firm energy, paired with incentives that meet local needs.
BPC is currently leading workshops with key leaders across industr y, utilities, non -
profits, and academia to identify and propose solutions for advancing the buildout of
data centers and infrastructure.
• Prioritize affordability and reliability in AI energy infrastructure development. Establish
critical guardrails that consider cost impacts and affordability for all customers
(residential, customer, industrial). By doing so, dual objectives of supporting digital
infrastructure and reducing energy bills for U.S. households and businesses  can be
achieved.

agencies to document core design choices, data inputs, and performance metrics for AI
used in public services, especially in high -impact applications. Transparency builds
trust, mitigates risk, and advances tools that serve the public good.


6 IV.Education and the Workforce
The adoption of AI can drive innovation and economic growth. However, public opinion on AI 
is often fraught with  misconceptions , debates, and concerns. Misinformation and mistrust 
remain significant barriers to adoption. When communities lack clear and accurate 
information, AI -enabled products and services may struggle to gain public support, limiting 
their potential impact.    
Building an AI -literate population is essential for national competitiveness, public confidence, 
and workforce preparedness in an increasingly digital world. AI -literate individuals make 
more informed technology decisions, understanding when AI meets their  needs and how to 
maximize its benefits while minimizing risks. To support this effort, BPC launched its AI 101 
initiative  for Congress in 2024, providing essential AI fundamentals, workshops, and 
resources to hundreds of Capitol Hill staffers. By equipping policymakers with the knowledge 
and resources they need, BPC helps advance forward -looking AI policies and opportunities .   
To unlock AI’s full potential, develop informed consumers, and build a skilled U.S. workforce 
capable of competing globally, BPC recommends the following actions:   
• Expand upskilling programs for the federal workforce. Offer civil servants micro -
credentials, short courses, and rotational assignments to rapidly boost AI competency.
A more technologically adept workforce will accelerate AI adoption in government
services, reduce reliance on external contractors, and ensure  cohesive policy
implementation.
• Establish training and grant programs for state and local readiness. Equip states and
municipalities with the knowledge, tools, and funding to integrate AI responsibly into
public services such as emergency response, transportation management, and
workforce development. Federal support can bridge resource gaps, ensure consi stent
service quality nationwide, and help local governments keep pace with rapid AI
advancements.
• Promote AI modules within core curricula at colleges and universities . Encourage federal
seed grants to develop, pilot, and scale AI learning modules across disciplines such as
engineering, health sciences, and public policy. Integrating AI fundamentals into
standard degree programs expands the pipeline of job -ready graduates  and fosters
cross-disciplinary innovation. Evaluating pilot modules will ensure they increase the
pipeline and equip graduates with AI -relevant skills, improving training practice and
cost effectiveness.
• Support existing DOE programs that are training the national AI workforce.  Federal
investment for AI education and workforce development is essential to harness AI’s


7 full potential and address its complex challenges. DOE programs such as Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory’s AI Summer Institute for undergraduates and DOE’s 
Computational Graduate Fellowship prepare individuals for productive and innovative 
careers in critical  sectors like health care, manufacturing, and defense.   
• Attract and retain foreign -born AI talent.  Direct the Department of Labor to update its
Schedule A Shortage Occupation list to expedite green card processing for AI -related
occupations facing domestic labor shortages. A strong pipeline of foreign -born AI
talent is critical for maintaining America’ s position as a global AI leader.
