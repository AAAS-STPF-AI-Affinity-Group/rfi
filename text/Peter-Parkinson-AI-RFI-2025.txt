Hi,
In regards to the recent Request for Information: Development of an Artificial
Intelligence Action Plan - https://www.regulations.gov/document/NSF_FRDOC_0001-
3479
I wanted to reach out as I have consolidated an objective framework, with succinctformula on what constitutes morality. I did not submit the work as I'm currently trying toconclude a book on which I can gain some form of financial compensation for trialsfaced leading to the formulation of the book.
Is there any party I could discuss this with further? Or perhaps when the book is finished
I can forward the relevant material?
I believe the work to be simple, but impenetrable. I would very much like to see the
material recieve full scrutiny and solidify itself as a fundamental basis concerning thefuture of AI moral infrastructure.
Thanks,Peter
