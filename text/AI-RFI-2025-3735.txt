General Comment
I strongly oppose this action plan. The current m ethods of obtaining training data are im m oral, illegal, and harm ful to the hum an writers,
artists, m usicians, and other creatives in this country. Furtherm ore, it's been shown by other m odels that OpenAI's m ethods are far too
inefficient and expensive to continue.
