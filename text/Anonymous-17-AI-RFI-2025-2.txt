Please listen and this is a serious post so thank you for reading this: the most important thing is 
developing an AI System that abides by the Fourth Amendment of the United States: Search and 
Seizure Regulated. I am very Pro-AI and I want it to be used to Enhance Human Privacy and 
Individual Freedoms, Rights, and Prosperity. I think that AI can be used ethically and is very 
useful in certain applications and it should not be used for Mass Surveillance or Intelligence 
Gathe ring on Citizens by Big Tech or any Malicious Actors Because That would mean that it 
possibly could be Violating the 4th Amendment of Search and Seizure Regulated. I am sending 
this because I am all about AI for Prosperity and Freedom. I think that since t he Snowden 
Revelation(s) have happened we should move forward and please don't repeat the same mistake 
of mass surveillance with Starshield and Stargate Projects Please. Not a criticism or judgement 
this is all just my opinion so thank you for allowing me the space to address this! Thank you so 
much God Bless America and Whoever is reading this just letting you know that this is a Real 
Person Not an AI Chatbot so thank you for taking the time for reading my comment!
