An effective national AI policy should ensure uniform value across all infrastructure components 
essential for American AI leadership. High -speed, low -latency fiber optic connectivity is crucial for 
transmitting vast amounts of data required for AI training and re al-time processing. Reliable network 
infrastructure ensures seamless communication between data centers, edge devices, and cloud 
platforms, enabling efficient AI operations and innovation.  
Zayo has a long history of building high -performing fiber optic net works and managing a massive 
global fiber optic network infrastructure. Founded in 2007, we have assembled a large portfolio of 
fiber networks with more than 18M miles of fiber and 146,000 route miles globally. As the only 
national fiber carrier to be awar ded Enabling Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program (MMGP) 
grant funds under the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Zayo is 
deploying network connectivity in rural areas while also connecting major metropolitan areas in 
anticipation of AI demand. Zayo was the first to break ground on an NTIA -funded Middl e Mile project 
in June of 2024.  
In this response to the National Science Foundation RFI for Artificial Intelligence Action Plan in 
support of the Presidential Executive Order 14179 (Removing Barriers to American Leadership in 
Artificial Intelligence), Zayo will highlight the importance of including fiber infrastructure 
deployments in the administration’s policy considerations in securing American leadership in 
Artificial Intell igence (AI).

High Priority Policy Actions to Include in the AI Plan  
There are opportunities to implement policies that encourage the rapid development of fiber networks 
in response to increased AI demand. Traditionally, middle -mile networks directly serve large 
bandwidth consumers and provide a bridge for last -mile connecti ons to rural residents and businesses. 
AI workloads require the movement of massive datasets between data centers, edge locations, and 
cloud platforms. These middle -mile networks act as AI corridors to ensure ultra -high-speed, low -
latency connectivity to s upport these data -intensive operations efficiently. Additionally, middle -mile 
fiber expansion inherently connects rural areas which today are experiencing high data -center growth 
due to power capacity. From this perspective, the middle -mile fiber provides both the underlying 
infrastructure to support sustainable rural economic growth through AI data center development and 
increases the number of rural households connected to the internet. The reallocation of existing 
programs, like BEAD, can prioritize fund ing AI corridors in rural areas.  
Federal investment into middle -mile networks, or AI corridors, can lower the cost for last -mile rural 
connectivity and create a reliable infrastructure backbone for the critical development of AI. 
Additionally, an open -access policy implemented by Internet Service Providers like Zayo should be 
promoted at the federal level. The Institute for Local Self -Reliance defines “open -access” as “an 
arrangement in which one network is open to independent Service Providers to offer  services”. As AI 
applications expand, open -access fiber networks allow multiple providers to compete and innovate, 
fostering infrastructure growth and ensuring that AI data centers and edge computing facilities have 
the connectivity and resiliency needed to scale efficiently.  
The evolution of data center development, driven by power availability rather than traditional 
population centers, highlights the need for federal policies that support strategic infrastructure 
investments. Federal energy policies sh ould align with AI infrastructure needs by prioritizing power 
availability for AI data centers. As power availability becomes the primary driver of data center 
placement, the government should streamline permitting processes for energy projects that direct ly 
support AI infrastructure. Establishing federal incentives for the expansion of energy grids in power -
rich but underdeveloped regions wil l encourage sustainable growth.  
Zayo is already adapting to these changes by developing critical middle -mile, or AI  corridor, 
infrastructure, such as the Reno -to-Las Vegas route, to support AI data center hubs. Expanding such 
initiatives through federal support would enhance connectivity between key AI regions and strengthen 
America's AI competitiveness. Support for t ax incentives or grants aimed at infrastructure 
development in non -traditional AI regions, such as Nevada and West Texas, would encourage 
investment and reduce the strain on exi sting metropolitan power grids.

When constructing fiber networks, Zayo Grou p and other fiber infrastructure companies must navigate 
various permitting requirements at the local, state, and federal levels. The construction of fiber 
networks, and specifically the burying or trenching of fiber cable, is the most costly element of fi ber 
infrastructure deployment. Permits are essential for ensuring compliance with public safety, 
environmental regulations, and right -of-way (ROW) guidelines while minimizing disruptions to 
existing infrastructure and utilities. New policy can encourage co llaboration between utilities and fiber 
infrastructure networks to optimize construction, right -of-way, and permitting costs.   
There are also opportunities to enhance coordination and efficiency, particularly for fiber networks 
spanning multiple states t hat support AI infrastructure. Currently, permitting agencies operate 
independently, requiring sequential approvals that extend project timelines. Greater federal 
coordination across state lines could streamline approvals, ensuring critical fiber infrastru cture is 
deployed efficiently. Improved agency responsiveness could prevent delays, as routine permit 
inquiries can take months. More direct tribal engagement could also facilitate smoother 
communication while respecting cultural considerations.  
The federal government is well -positioned to facilitate infrastructure development on federal lands 
and across state jurisdictions. By fostering a more coordinated, federally supported approach —
especially for fiber networks essential to AI development —the U.S. can  accelerate deployment. 
Streamlining environmental, cultural, and archaeological reviews can leverage new technologies, such 
as drones, to reduce manual, time -consuming processes. Expedited ROW access can be achieved by 
implementing shot clocks for approva ls, limiting permitting corrections, using actual -cost based 
permitting, minimizing reviews in previously disturbed areas, and consolidating mult i-level approvals 
to cut costs.  
At the state level, clarifying lead agency roles and refining policies could  help reduce bottlenecks. 
Reliance on third -party contractors has increased costs, while Department of Transportation (DOT) 
processes —such as staff shortages and complex design requirements —have added delays. Addressing 
these challenges would improve deplo yment efficiency.

Middle-mile networks connect regional areas to broader internet infrastructures, enabling the efficient 
transfer of large data volumes. Distributed systems of data centers that train, generate, and apply AI 
applications across the nati on require AI corridor networks to provide high -capacity connections over 
long distances, linking cities and regions. They are essential for supporting the expansion of AI -driven 
data centers and meeting growing bandwidth demands.  
Zayo is building 5,000+  miles of long -haul and AI corridors to support AI -driven data center growth, 
which is expected to increase up to six fold by 2030. However, the current rate of fiber infrastructure 
expansion is not keeping pace with the rapid rise in AI workloads, which co uld create a significant 
infrastructure gap, hindering the innovation and scalability of AI applications. As one of the few 
companies to deploy new long -haul networks in the past decade, Zayo’s expansion is critical to 
preventing this gap.  
New fiber routes are essential to support AI -driven demand. Without expansion, network constraints 
will limit the full potential of AI adoption and existing federal funding plays a key role in expansion. 
Through the NTIA’s Enabling Middle Mile Broadband In frastructure Program  (MMGP), Zayo was 
awarded $92.9 million to build critical middle -mile connections across eight states. These routes will 
lower costs for carriers to extend last -mile services, improving connectivity for rural communities, 
businesses, and commu nity anchor institutions. Additionally, Zayo has designed these middle -mile 
routes as AI Corridors, recognizing the shift of data centers to rural areas where power capacity and 
land remain available.  
Zayo predicts that U.S. data center power demand is e xpected to grow from 25 GW to between 65 
GW and 148 GW by 2030, driven by AI. To meet growing demand, Zayo will add five new long -haul 
routes and overbuild seven existing ones, optimizing connectivity between key data center hubs. AI 
providers are shifting  to emerging markets to access lower power costs, making alignment between 
fiber and energy availability critical. Several of these projects receive NTIA MMGP funding, with 
additional investments planned. In the past five years, Zayo has completed 15 long -haul routes totaling 
5,000+ miles. Federal coordination and investment in fiber infrastructure are essential to ensuring the 
U.S. can meet AI’s growing bandwidth needs while expanding broadband access to rural communities.
