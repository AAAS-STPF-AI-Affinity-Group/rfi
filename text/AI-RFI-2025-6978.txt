General Comment
Rem oving the (already very flim sy) guard rails against AI theft of intellectual property will put the United States at a significant com m ercial
disadvantage to other developed nations and harm  m illions of individuals and com panies who rely on their copyrighted work to m ake a
profit. It would be shockingly irresponsible and bad for business to deregulate an industry that is already built on theft.
