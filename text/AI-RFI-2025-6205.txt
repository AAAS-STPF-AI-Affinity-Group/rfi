General Comment
This com m ent will likely fall on deaf ears as this adm in clearly lacks all decency, displaying the willingness to tram ple on the Am erican
people's rights and freedom s. Now it is proposing letting m assively inflated corporations that produce nothing worthwhile to the Am erican
people STEAL their copyrighted m aterial as well. This, if approved, is a new low and the death nail of Am erican copyright protection for
those without the im m ense wealth to catch the ear of and unfairly sway the opinions of higher offices, all this only to em power a com pany's
worthless product that will only succeed in putting m ore Am ericans out of work.
