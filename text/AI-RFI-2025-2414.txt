General Comment
AI is debilitating for every form  of em ploym ent - in addition to the m ore obvious entities that can be replaced by AI, such as artists,
creatives, and lower-level em ployees, m anagerial positions are also liable to be replaced by AI upon further advancem ent - from  a
business perspective, why would you em ploy som eone to review an AI's work when you can just have the AI double-check its work? 
AI, at this stage, will not be the answer to any problem s Am ericans currently face. It cannot efficiently process inform ation com pared to
hum ans, and is currently prone to hallucinating false data points and developing biases based on user expectation. I strongly suggest
avoiding im plem entation until significant safeguards are in place.
