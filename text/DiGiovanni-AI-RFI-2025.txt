It is this citizen’s opinion that AI is a frivolous technology that provides no material benefit to 
the A merican people. The removal of “Unnecessary burdensome requirements” amounts to 
wholesale gutting of copyright protections for the sole benefit of a ma ssive corporation that seeks 
only to gain more profit at the expense of all. Empowering these AI models will result in unprecedented misinformation campaigns and catastrophic decay in foundational skills of students for generations to come. I wholeheartedl y rebuke this push to grant special privileges to 
a corporation.
