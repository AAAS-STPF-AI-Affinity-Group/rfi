As it currently stands the technology is ineffective and dangerous. It's prone to craftingfalsehoods and is already being used to create deepfakes
 that distort our understanding of
reality, revenge porn that ruins lives and child sexual assault material that enables the worstkind of abusers. Nevermind we're already seeing evidence it deadens the critical thinkingfaculties of children and adults who rely on it too heavily.
Furthermore the technology is built on the stolen work of creative people across the world and
across time. Copyrighted material that's been illegally fed into these algorithms. This is atechnology that should not be moved upon with haste but instead cautiously and in a mannerthat forces it to be done ethically or not at all.
