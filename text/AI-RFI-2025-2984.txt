General Comment
AI is a m ajor threat to the Am erican econom y as it steals jobs away from  hum an workers. Each tim e a new generative AI m odel is
released, unem ploym ent spikes. Encouraging it's developm ent is an attack against the people, and allowing it to use copyrighted works
underm ines the very purpose of copyright in every way since the better the AI gets, the easier it will be for anyone to ask for a direct
transcript of it's training m aterial.
For now all it can do is plagiarize, but if this continues it can and will be used to outright pirate it's sources. I strongly oppose this bill by
every account.
