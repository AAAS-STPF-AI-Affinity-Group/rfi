General Comment
I do not believe AI has a place in the future of Am erica. As it stands right now it is actively being used to threaten the livelihoods of
anyone working in a creative space leading to a larger rate of unem ploym ent within these industries and on top of all of this it is very easy
for AI to provide & spread false inform ation which is a plague that has to be rem edied.
