The following three overarching objectives are offered for consideration as the National Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan is developed: o Any AI application that is developed by and used 
internally by the U.S. government must be totally secure. Ent ities outside the U.S. government must 
not be able to successfully attack or penetrate government AI applications. Physical security of U.S. 
AI applications inside the U.S. government must designed to prevent compromise from within the 
U.S. government as w ell. U.S AI systems must also have an offensive capability, to attack and 
punish those outside entities who attempt to attack or penetrate U.S. government AI applications. o 
Ensure that U.S. private enterprises are required to make their AI applications to tally secure to 
prevent theft or an attack from other entities, especially foreign governments. The U.S. government 
should provide assistance to private enterprise AI developers to achieve the security necessary. o 
When developing a U.S. government AI appl ication, a sustained “focus” on the AI objectives is 
critical. System designers and programmers are intelligent people with a dynamic skill set. 
However, it takes a dedicated effort to maintain focus on the AI objectives so the effort doesn’t get 
off track by developing system capabilities that are technically flashy and possible, but are not the 
best answer for the AI objective at hand. Some one or small group needs to be dedicated to 
maintaining focus. o I hope this helps a little.
