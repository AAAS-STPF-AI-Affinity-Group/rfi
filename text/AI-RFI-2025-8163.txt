General Comment
What m akes a technology com pany an exception to copyright laws? The answer is: nothing. If you answer any other answer, then you
m ust be in their pocket. We cannot allow AI com panies to skirt copyright laws that everyone else is beholden to just because they say
they cannot m ake their product without it. Well boo hoo, then they can’t m ake their product. Especially when that product’s sole purpose
is to put the very people (artists, writers, coders, etc) they are stealing/copying from  out of work. AI is theft, pure and sim ple, and if you
allow any AI com pany to be an exception to established law, then you will see a few already-rich tech com panies stealing all the hard-
earned wealth from  countless creatives and others. That’s all they really want. Please do not allow it.
