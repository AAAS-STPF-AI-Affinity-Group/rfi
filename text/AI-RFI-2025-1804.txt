General Comment
Current laws of copyright and fair use m ust be stressed to prevent artist work being stolen to be used by AI either directly or for training
purposes. This is im perative. If AI developm ent com panies cannot afford to license training m aterials, they cannot afford to be in their
business. Artist work should not be stolen just to be regurgitated by artificial intelligence. It is theft and if anything it should be m ake
explicitly illegal.
