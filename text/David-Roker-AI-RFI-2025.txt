As a small business owner who's built my livelihood creating original content since 2015, I
urge the administration to address three critical issues in the AI Action Plan:
Anti-Competitive AI Practices: Last month, our recipe blog
disappeared from Google search results—algorithmically replacedby AI-generated "food guides" scraped from our original work.This isn't isolated. When platforms like Google prioritizetheir own AI content over human creators through searchmanipulation, they're not just harming businesses—they'restarving cultural innovation.
Copyright Integrity: My team spends weeks developing original
photography and testing recipes. AI tools now replicate oursignature style in minutes using stolen training data. Withoutmeaningful copyright enforcement, we'll see a collapse ofcreative incentives—exactly what copyright law was designed toprevent.
Small Business Protections: The current system lets Big Tech:
Use AI to demote human creators in search rankings
Avoid licensing costs through "fair use" loopholes
Control both AI tools and distribution channels
I propose:
Mandatory transparency for AI training data sources
Federal oversight of search engine content prioritization
Updated DMCA provisions addressing AI-generated derivatives
Our 8-person team represents thousands of American creators
facing extinction from unchecked AI exploitation. Pleaseensure this plan protects those who actually make theinternet valuable—not just those who automate it.
1.Creative Economy Threats
Google's search dominance now actively replaces human creatorswith AI content scraped from our work - my recipe blog lost 80%traffic after their 2024 "Helpful Content" update redirectedqueries to AI summaries. Without copyright enforcement, we'rewitnessing digital sharecropping 2.0.
2.Platform-Enabled Harms
The same AI tools demoting creators empower predators on sites
like doxbin.com and swat.wiki. Last month, scammers used voice-
cloning AI to impersonate my accountant in a $12k wire fraud


attempt - a scheme now rampant on r/Scams and r/Sextortion.
3. Synthetic Identity Crisis
AI-generated " Frankenstein identities " combine stolen SSNs with
fabricated faces/voices, making financial fraud detectionnearly impossible. My local credit union reports 37% of 2024fraud cases involved AI-synthesized biometrics .
Solutions Needed :
Creator Protections :
Mandatory AI training data audits
Search engine ranking transparency requirements
Personal Safeguards :
Ban on AI voice cloning without dual-consent verification
Federal rapid-response team for synthetic identity fraud
Platform liability for unmoderated AI-generated harassment
Tech Accountability :
Break Google's dual role as AI developer/search gatekeeper
Treat LLMs like financial institutions for KYC protocols
The r/IdentityTheft community has documented 614 cases thisyear of AI-generated blackmail using fabricated explicitcontent. This isn't theoretical - it's happening now,enabled by the same systems erasing creative livelihoods.
Sincerely,David Roker.
