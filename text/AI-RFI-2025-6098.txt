General Comment
Private interests are trying to convince the governm ent that AI (defined as generative AI program s such as ChatGPT) is som e sort of
national security concern or way of boosting our country's power. It is not. Recent AI developm ents are sim ply a schem e by a few rich
m en to take control of all copyrighted works in the country and to drain m oney from  the governm ent via sham  contracts and grants. AI is
a grift that has already done so m uch dam age to our leaders and citizens. It has no place in the United States. The con m en who are
lobbying for the governm ent to em brace them  and hand them  billions should be refused entirely, as they are exploiting this country. Do not
give them  free reign to exploit it further.
