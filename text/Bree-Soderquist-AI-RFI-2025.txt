To whom it may concern,
AI is absolute theft and hurts all of those it steals data from. By training AI on art, you are
disposing of the key pieces that make us human. We are nothing without our art. We havecelebrated artists for centuries, but absolving the copyright protections we are throwing awayhundreds of years of love and passion for the arts. Computers are incapable of passion, leave itto humans. We certainly aren't letting humans live better lives at the cost of this.
 
AI has a HUGE carbon footprint, its so incredibly wasteful to our increasingly limitedresources for our own survival. We will starve and kill our people for a program that has nouse for our resources to live.
AI has no place in our future. America does not need AI. We have accomplished so much
without it, it's not going to benefit us as a people, as a society.
 
Do things right, do things better. This country was built on our blood, sweat, and tears. Itshould stay that way.
Regards,
Bree
