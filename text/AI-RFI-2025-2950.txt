General Comment
Copyright should not be waved for AI corporations to steal from  the Am erican people. Writers, artists, voice actors, and other creatives
are already losing their jobs to AI trained on their data, and the only hope is that copyright lawsuits can stop this. Without that, why would
anyone create anything anym ore if a soulless AI can just repackage it and sell it as its own product? Whose to stop som eone from
opening a fake AI com pany, allowing them  legal access to all copyright m aterial? This is an insane blank check that cannot be allowed to
happen.
