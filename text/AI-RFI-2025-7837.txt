General Comment
I do not believe AI, specifically generative AI and large language m odels, hold any sort of place in the future of the USA. These sorts of
"AI" steal from  the livelihood of other Am ericans, and profits off of that theft. It is overhyped, m uch like the stock m arket in 1929. It is
over-sanitized, and putting a fleece over the eyes of the Am erican public. An aggregate of thousands of responses m ashed together is
guaranteed to be low quality. That's not what Am ericans deserve in their governm ent and in their lives.
