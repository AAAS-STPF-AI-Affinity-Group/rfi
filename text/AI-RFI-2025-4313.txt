General Comment
As a veteran and career inform ation security expert, the plan to allow AI com panies to train their m odels on creative content they don't
own without com pensation to the creators is abhorrent. There are extrem ely powerful privacy im plications involved. The data gathered
WILL have PII and other sensitive inform ation in it. Any large scrapping of creative content cannot fail to also gather PII that will be
forever baked into the m odel.
This is also just outright copyright infringem ent on a m assive scale. It m ay sound like Generative AI can replace creative workers, but they
can't. The products will always be inferior as no true creativity exists. But that won't stop m assive im plosions of creative industries. This
will hurt Am erica in the short and long term . There is NO public benefit to this plan.
