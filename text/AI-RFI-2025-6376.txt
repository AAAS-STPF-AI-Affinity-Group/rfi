General Comment
I strongly oppose the developm ent of any AI policies that do not protect the copyrights and livelihoods of artists, writers, and content
creators. AI m odels are based on training data that is by and large collected illegally, without perm ission or consent, and in direct violation
of copyright law and intellectual property protection. This negatively affects the livelihoods of m illions of artists, writers, photographers,
m usicians, and other content creators, whose work is being stolen for program s that act as direct com petition. AI com panies should not
be given a pass to steal the work of Am erican creatives on an unprecedented scale. If AI m odels cannot be developed without copyright
infringem ent, without taking peopleâ€™s work without perm ission, then they should not be developed at all.
