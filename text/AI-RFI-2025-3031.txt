General Comment
Hello,
Artificial Intelligence, as sold to us by Big Tech is just the latest in a series of grifts, following cryptocurrency and NFTs. It is sold as id its
the future but burns out in only a few years. We do not need a robust action plan for AI. Microsoft is slowing down the construction of
data centers becuase it doesn't see AI growing as far as its proponents claim . Generative AI is a fad that will pass, and in the m eantim e it
will harm  working people who m ake art and writing that the AI takes to train on..
Just let it fade away quietly, like it is bound to do anyway.
Thank you,
