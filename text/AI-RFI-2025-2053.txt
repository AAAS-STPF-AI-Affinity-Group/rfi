General Comment
Generative AI is built on a vast database of stolen copyrighted m aterial, and those vital copyright laws are the "unnecessarily burdensom e
requirem ents" this plan seeks to overturn. By catering to the interests of m onopolistic technology corporations, this plan threatens to
destroy the USA creative econom y as we know it, potentially killing m illions of jobs across the entertainm ent and arts industries.
Pursuing Am erican AI dom inance at all costs will do incalcuable harm  to hardworking Am ericans and sm all businesses. Do not let tech
giants dictate policy--their only goal is to m ake them selves richer, no m atter what xenophobic rationalizations they give.
