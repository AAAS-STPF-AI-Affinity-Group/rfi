AI is a mistake. It's a tool that profits off of theft and risks the livelihood of American citizens.
People have actively boycotted companies using AI, have avoided products that use AI, or goout of their way to turn off any AI features that are forced onto their devices and programs.While AI does have its place (such as detecting diseases before they're noticed by humans),things like generative art and writing have no such place in this world, nor does the world needthem. All generative AI does is pilfer from actual artists and open oneself up to get a lawsuitfiled against them. Unless you are planning on getting rid of copyright altogether for everyone,then this endeavor for AI is not worth it. This is not even getting into the negativeenvironmental impact AI causes with its consumption of electricity and carbon dioxideemissions.
The negatives far, far,
 outweigh the positives for AI. Please take this into consideration.
Getting rid of AI will only be a positive gain for you both financially and in the public eye.
This I can assure you.
