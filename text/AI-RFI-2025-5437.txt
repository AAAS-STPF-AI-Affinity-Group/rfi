General Comment
Subject: Response to Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
We are writing to provide input on developing the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan, as requested in the Federal Register notice
published on February 6, 2025. Our insights are inform ed by the AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA, see https://aiira.iastate.edu/
), a collaborative initiative led by Iowa State University with faculty from  eight universities and organizations across the United States.
AIIRA directly im pacts thousands of farm ers through its partnership with the Iowa Soybean Association and extensive collaborations with
industry stakeholders and the startup ecosystem .
The Role of Higher Education in Advancing AI in Agriculture: Higher education institutions play a critical role in driving AI innovation,
particularly in agriculture. Universities serve as centers for interdisciplinary research, integrating expertise in AI, plant sciences, robotics,
data analytics, and social sciences to tackle com plex agricultural challenges. At AIIRA, this collaborative approach has led to significant
developm ents, including AI-driven predictive digital twins that enhance agricultural resiliency and profitability, as well as foundational AI
m odels that help producers identify and m itigate pests in a tim ely fashion. AIIRA also provides unbiased assessm ents of AI tools for
industry partners.
AIIRA dem onstrates the transform ative integration of AI into agriculture through higher education collaboration in the following ways:
Innovative Research: AIIRA is pioneering predictive digital twins, advanced robotics, and robust com puter vision m odels that enable
precise, resource-efficient, and resilient agricultural practices. 
Interdisciplinary Collaboration: AIIRA unites experts across universities, industry partners, farm ers, and startups, leveraging m ultiple
perspectives and expertise to ensure AI innovations are practical, scalable, and im pactful.
Educational and Outreach Initiatives: AIIRA delivers training workshops, educational resources, and outreach program s, fostering
widespread AI adoption am ong farm ers, com m odity groups, and the agricultural workforce. AIIRA also Incorporates initiatives focused
on upskilling and reskilling the existing workforce within sm all and m edium -sized enterprises (SMEs) across the Midwest to enhance
workforce adaptability and ensure that Middle Am erica rem ains econom ically com petitive in the era of AI-driven advancem ents.
Recom m endations for the AI Action Plan: Drawing from  AIIRAâ€™s com prehensive vision and com m unity-wide strategic engagem ents, we
recom m end the following actions:
1) Enhanced Support for Interdisciplinary Research: Fund collaborative initiatives integrating AI with agriculture (AI+Ag), leveraging
academ ic expertise to overcom e barriers such as data scarcity and technology accessibility, benefiting both large-scale operations and
sm aller farm s.
2) Investm ent in AI Education and Workforce Developm ent: Expand interdisciplinary educational program s that address skills gaps in
agriculture, training professionals capable of deploying and utilizing AI technologies effectively across diverse agricultural contexts.
3) Establish/Sustain National AI Research Infrastructure: Create national-scale infrastructure with advanced com puting facilities, persistent
data storage, and secure data-sharing platform s to enable robust academ ic AI research and accelerate technology transfer from  academ ia


to industry and farm s.
4) Strengthen Public-Private and Startup Partnerships: Encourage and facilitate strategic collaborations am ong universities, industry
partners, startup ecosystem s, and com m odity groups like the Iowa Soybean Association, and Iowa Corn Growers Association to
expedite the practical deploym ent and adoption of AI innovations in agriculture.
5) Ensure Practical and Effective AI Deploym ent: Develop policy guidelines that support AI innovation while addressing legal and societal
considerations, ensuring technologies rem ain transparent, effective, and accessible to all, including rural and agricultural com m unities,
without burdensom e restrictions that hinder progress.
By incorporating these recom m endations, the AI Action Plan can harness the strengths of higher education institutions and their
partnership with industry and agricultural com m unities to drive significant advancem ents in AI, bolstering agricultural productivity,
econom ic com petitiveness, and sustainability.
