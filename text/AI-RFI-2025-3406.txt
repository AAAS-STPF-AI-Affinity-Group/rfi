General Comment
Our top priority should be diverting resources from  the AI boondoggle to som e other purposes that will actually provide for the m aterial
needs of Am ericans. Perhaps m uch needed physical infrastructure, or im proving access to healthcare. Or m aybe just distributing rubber
bouncy balls to young ruffians. Just about any use of our governm ent's tim e and taxpayer dollars would be better. 
There's no use to giving social m aladroit coastal elite tech bros unfettered access to the copyrighted works of genuine Am erican artists,
artisans, scientists, and innovators, just so they can waste energy, literal electric energy m ind you, training a m achine that is wrong 60% of
the tim e.
China beat us to the punch with Deep seek, let's just agree to take the L, m ove on, and do som ething better with our tim e.
