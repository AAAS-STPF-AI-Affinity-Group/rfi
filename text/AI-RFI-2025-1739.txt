General Comment
Hi, m y nam e's Cassidy, and I work for a com pany that trains AI m odels including Grok, ChatGPT, and others. As som eone that deals
with AI and reviews them  often, I can state with som e fam iliarity that while AI is becom ing m ore advanced over tim e, it isn't the 'artificial
intelligence' we want it to be. It's a calculator trying to com pute excessively com plicated problem s, and often tim es failing. 
Bots often lose track of details within conversations within 10 turns, or 10 exchanges of that conversation, even this far into developm ent.
Trusting m ore power to AI is a bad idea, because it's just going to prove m ore inconsistent than hum an brainpower. Mankind is
dependable, and hiring real people to do real tasks is how we create jobs. AI m odels are inconsistent when it com es to fine detail, and
while som e AI can do rather in-depth things, there's no ingenuity due to every solution com ing from  a thinking brain first.
A m ovem ent to enhance the power of AI is a m ovem ent against hum an ingenuity in Am erica, a m ovem ent against the profit of the working
m an in Am erica, and a m ovem ent against faith in m ankind as a whole. Every dim e spent pushing AI forward could be spent on the
Am erican people in a tangible way.
