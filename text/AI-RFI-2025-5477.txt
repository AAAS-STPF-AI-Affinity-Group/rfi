General Comment
I’m  an inform ation professional working in an academ ic library and find m yself horrified daily by the ways AI is being used to plaigiarize
original work, pilfer personal data, prom ulgate m isinform ation, disinform ation, bias, racism , and generally m ake the hum an world actively
worse in innum erable ways. 
It is baffling to m e that we’d ever em power artificial intelligence over hum an intelligence. Hum an innovation. Hum an creativity. Hum an
reason. Em power it over the very necessary and hum an need to m ake m istakes and learn from  them , to think critically. I abhor the route
AI is taking us as a culture. If we allow the m ass theft—for that is what it is—of hum an-created output, we’re no better than China and its
refusal to recognize intellectual property, copyright, the sanctity of craft. Is that what we’ve com e to? A country of individuality and
innovation, of freedom  and autonom y, until it can be subjugated to a m achine. Subjugated to inadequate tech bros who value and revere
nothing but profit. This is not the future I want. If it’s the future the NSF and this country endorses, prepare to enjoy that future where
science as we understand and practice it no longer exists.
