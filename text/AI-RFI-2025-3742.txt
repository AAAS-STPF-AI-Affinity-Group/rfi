General Comment
I strongly oppose this m easure. AI steals original content for corporate gain. They want access to our hard work for free so that they can
profit on our livelihoods. AI com panies literally illegally steal our work and attem pt to sell it back. AI is an overhyped trend that the
Am erican people are tired of and is only pushed by corporate interests because of m onied investm ents. Sorry you m ade the wrong
investm ent, but we don't want this.
AI does not have a future in Am erica- it steals Am erican jobs, steals Am erican's livelihoods, steals original creative m aterials, and
consum es vast unnecessary am ounts of energy. It's a bad investm ent and a bad way forward for Am erica.
