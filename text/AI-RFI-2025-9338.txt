General Comment
You cannot legalise the theft that OpenAI and other generative AI com panies have and are com m itting. 
To do so would destroy copyright law and IP laws in this country and around the world. 
We will not stop fighting against the blatant theft of our work. 
If you do this we will bring the fight to your doorstep as well. 
Don't enable these crim inals m asquerading as tech-bros. Do the right thing.
