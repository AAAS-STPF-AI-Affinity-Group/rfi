General Comment
Understand that the use of AI in any official regard within governm ent or sim ilar settings and avenues can and will open the floodgates that
harm s not just people who would otherwise profit from  their own labor, but those who currently hold power, influence, etc.
This will be a net negative for the nation as a whole at the very least. Do not put the livelihoods and lives of everyone in jeopardy because
the concept of AI seem s useful or revolutionary. Do not be so short sighted.
