General Comment
While there m ay be good use cases for generative AI, it is currently an enorm ous waste of resources and a clear asset bubble. The
developm ent and use of new m odels will only be successful under regulation that aggressively defends intellectual property rights. AI firm s
should be free to pursue profitable applications (though few have so far been found), but these m ultinational firm s m ust not be perm itted to
pass on the m any externalities of their business m odel to US taxpayers.
