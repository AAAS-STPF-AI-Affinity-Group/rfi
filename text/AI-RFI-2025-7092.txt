General Comment
Please do not allow AI com panies to access copyrighted inform ation. It is unconscionable that we would allow these corporations to
profit off of artists, writers, and other creators who pour their hearts and souls into creating beautiful and im portant works, only to allow
their work to be stolen by greedy tech oligarchs for the purposes of im proving their horrible, destructive AI products which alm ost no one
wants to use.
Do not allow this plan to go through
