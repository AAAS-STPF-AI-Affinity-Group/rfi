General Comment
We cannot have legal protections for creatives gutted just for Google and OpenAI to train their unethical, horrible algorithm s that don't
even work properly m ost of the tim e. Copyright protections isn't the best but it is som ething, and it is the only thing m ost creatives have to
protect their work.
