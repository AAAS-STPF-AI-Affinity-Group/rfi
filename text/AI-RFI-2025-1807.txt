General Comment
As a m em ber of a technology research initiative, I can say that generative AI is a dead end and a terrible use of US public resources.
REDUCING the burden of proof on corporations attem pting to use it (as so m any currently are to no end with disastrous effects on their
products and public im age) is contrary to the desires of Am ericans, and certainly not for Am erica's benefit.
