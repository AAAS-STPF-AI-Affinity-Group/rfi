General Comment
I am  a content creator in crafts and DIY. No one is considering the long term  im plications of how AI affects content creators. What is the
m otivation for som eone like m e to continue to generate ideas and tutorials? I'm  not going to generate content to m ake m oney for Google
or ChatGPT. I im plore you to consult with content creators closely on this. I'm  not saying AI shouldn't exist - but with the way it is now,
there is zero m otivation to feed the beast. This significantly affects sm all businesses like m ine in negative ways.
