General Comment
It's a dead end technology at the end of its hype cycle. Com panies and investors are throwing m oney at this tool hoping to stum ble onto a
way to m ake m oney; none have succeeded so far and new m odels show that building bigger m odels yields fewer and fewer returns.
Essentially, this is like the NFT bubble that is just waiting to pop. Regulation is of the utm ost im portance and m ust be done carefully.
