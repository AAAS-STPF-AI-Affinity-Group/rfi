I am begging you to not let OpenAI use copyrights material to train their AI, it is STEALING! I don't think
AI has a place in the future of the U.S, I think it is a major threat! It steals jobs, it steals material, itconsumes so much energy, the idiots in the Government want to implement it to control very sensitivesectors, if anything, AI should be outlawed and Open AI should be shut down or banned fromGovernment affairs. Again, it steals from the livelihood of Americans and Profits off theft. You cannotpossibly support that.
 Please stop OpenAI from being able to make things worse. I don't want to be rude, but if you allow them
to do what they please, it's just proof of how many bad people are in the White House.
