General Comment
Generative AI is set to steal from  all art form  creators in favor of tech com panies with far m ore resources than any individual will have.
This will have disastrous consequences for avoiding m onopolies and genuine copyright protections. We should be protecting those who
have been and will be effected by brash use of "creative" AI tools, whether it has taken workers jobs, or outright stolen creations from
sm all artists.
