General Comment
I am  strongly against this proposed AI Action Plan. 
When we seek inform ation out, we also have to question the sources of where it cam e from . AI has been notoriously bad at m angling
facts when looking up data. For exam ple, I work in custom er service at a place where people som etim es search for pricing inform ation on
Google's AI search, and it gives them  outdated and m isleading inform ation from  other places on the internet, rather than the up to date
inform ation on the website.
Plus all this inform ation and m edia was created by people, how will the contributions of these people be com pensated? Or credited?
There is a m assive chunk of the workforce ranging from  artists to STEM positions that could not only be put out of work, but without their
credits what could they even show they accom plished? They wouldn't even be able to put these things on their resum e.
When trying to argue your stance on som ething, it helps to be able to back up that claim  with evidence and credibility. The abuse of data
for the ram pant use of AI that would com e from  this order would rem ove that com pletely and be devastating for the econom y and the
people of this nation.
