Dear Sir or Madam,
I vehemently hate the idea of "artificial intelligence" because there can be no such thing.  
Perhaps "programmed intelligence" would be a more proper name for the computer program
you are talking about.   
The technology world has gotten too far in front of it's nose.   I understand the need to come
up with some use case for the programs due to the billions and billions of dollars wasted upuntil now.
  Nevertheless, that does not make it a good idea.
Now, it comes to light that these "LLM's" were trained on stolen and/or pirated materialsalong with masses of publically available information.
  You, being the government and our
nations primary law enforcement entity, should have put a stop to that in the beginning.   by
allowing the continued overstepping of a certain "special" portion of the business class, youhave trashed the high ideals that were once attainable.
You are creating Skynet, whether you admit that or not.
  Guardrails and laws and penalties
were needed years ago.   I strongly support them today.   
With that said, I will end my complaining for the evening.   Good Night.
