General Comment
This is beyond horrendous. This is horrifying to any and all artists, authors, scientists, engineers, EVERYONE. This is blatant robbery of
the arts and hum anities. An attem pt to steal and copy and reproduce POORLY any and all published public inform ation. It is WELL
known that AI is widely inaccurate. AI is an attem pt to rob the m odern population of critical thought and literacy skills. AI is producing
brain dead, unable to function teenagers who rely on it for any and all input and knowledge. AI is robbery of thought and function. It is an
attem pt to steal the hum an consciousness and replace all the hum anities and arts with m ass produced, horrendously m ade products that
rob true HUMAN artists of their own creations. This is robbery of the soul. This is robbery of consciousness.
