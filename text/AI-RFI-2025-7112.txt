General Comment
AI has already cem ented its place in this world but this is not the way to go about its continued use. Wielding it in this way is not
constructive. It will cause long term  com plications if we allow AI to be used this freely, it is unjust and un-Am erican, encroaching on
billionsâ€™ freedom s. Reconsider, review, revise. Thank you.
