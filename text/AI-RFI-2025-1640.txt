General Comment
Copyright law should rem ain as is and should not allow protection for AI. Not only would any change to copyright law negatively im pact
businesses big and sm all, it would create legal loopholes that would virtually elim inate copyright protection for all intellectual property. It's
bad for business and bad for Am ericans.
