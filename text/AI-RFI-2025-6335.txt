General Comment
Reasons why I do not support the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan:
1.I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
2.AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
3.AI is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and huge legal problem s by
enabling them .
4.AI disenfranchises artists (especially those who are chronically ill or disabled) from  the opportunity to have a m ore stable incom e
through their work.
5.AI search results have poisoned Google im age results (exam ples include anim al photography, historically accurate clothing,
cartoony/stylized art pieces, etc.)
