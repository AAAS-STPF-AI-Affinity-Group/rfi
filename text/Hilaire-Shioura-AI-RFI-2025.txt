Statement of Public Dissemination:  
This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no 
business-proprietary or confidential information. Document contents may be reused by the

Establishing a Department of Technology for AI Governance 
To effectively navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by artificial intelligence (AI), 
the U.S. must establish a Department of Technology led by elected technology officials. This 
structure ensures transparency, accountability, and alignment with national priorities, fostering 
AI innovation while safeguarding ethical standards. Given AI's growing role in critical 
infrastructure, economic competitiveness, and national security, a dedicated governance body is 
necessary to guide policy and investment effectively. 
 1 


1. AI Hardware and Infrastructure
Policy Action: 
●Establish federal funding programs to support AI hardware development, including
domestic semiconductor manufacturing and high-performance computing systems, with
an initial investment of $5 billion .
●Develop public-private partnerships to build and maintain energy-efficient AI data
centers, integrating small modular reactors (SMRs) for sustainable power, with a 60-40
government-industry investment split.
●Create a national AI infrastructure roadmap to ensure widespread access to computing
resources for researchers, startups, and government agencies, with oversight by the newly
created Department of Technology.
2. AI Model Development and Open-Source AI
Policy Action: 
●Promote open-source AI initiatives with government-backed funding and regulatory
frameworks to prevent monopolization of AI technologies, ensuring accessibility across
industries.
●Develop federal standards for AI model transparency and ethical use, aligning with
NIST guidelines to enhance fairness, security, and accountability.
●Mandate AI model validation processes to verify performance, safety, and risk
mitigation before deployment in critical sectors, with certification overseen by an
independent regulatory body.

3. Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, and AI Safety
Policy Action: 
●Implement mandatory AI security risk assessments  for all federally deployed AI
systems, overseeing, correcting, and modifying recommendations from CISA and NIST.
●Strengthen data privacy laws by amending the Federal Data Protection Act to explicitly
regulate AI-driven data collection and usage .
●Establish a National AI Safety Board to investigate and mitigate AI-related security
threats and breaches, modeled after the National Transportation Safety Board.
4. National Security and Defense Applications of AI
Policy Action: 
●Require democratic oversight of AI defense applications through regular congressional
briefings and independent audits, ensuring adherence to ethical military AI standards.
●Develop international AI defense cooperation agreements with allied nations to align
security protocols and prevent or mitigate an AI arms race .
●Ensure AI autonomy limits in warfare, mandating human oversight in all military AI
decision-making processes, as outlined in the U.S. Department of Defense's AI Ethical
Principles.

5. Regulation, Governance, and Technical Standards
Policy Action: 
●Establish a Technology Ethics and Standards Office  within the proposed Department of
Technology to oversee AI regulations and compliance, coordinating with agencies such
as the FTC and DOJ.
●Mandate transparent reporting requirements for companies developing AI systems
with national security or critical infrastructure implications, ensuring accountability
through public disclosures.
●Create adaptive regulatory frameworks that evolve alongside AI advancements,
incorporating annual review mechanisms to prevent bureaucratic stagnation.
6. Research, Education, Workforce Development, and Innovation
Policy Action: 
●Fund AI-focused STEM education programs at all academic levels to build a robust
AI-skilled workforce, with $2 billion allocated to K-12 and university-level AI education
initiatives.
●Establish AI innovation hubs  in collaboration with universities and industry leaders to
accelerate research and commercialization, modeled after DARPA’s AI investments .
●Implement AI retraining programs for workers displaced by automation, offering
incentives for businesses that support workforce transitions through AI upskilling
initiatives.

Summary 
A Department of Technology led by elected officials will provide a structured and accountable 
governance model for AI development in the U.S. This proposal aligns with the goals outlined in 
the AI Action Plan RFI by ensuring transparency, security, and innovation in AI governance. 
Through these policy actions, the U.S. can maintain its leadership in AI while safeguarding 
national interests and public trust. A balanced approach between regulation and innovation will 
empower the private sector while ensuring AI's ethical and safe development.
