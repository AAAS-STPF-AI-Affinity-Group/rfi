General Comment
Hey, yeah, don't do this. This will just allow for those with wealth, m eans, and technological access to steal intellectually from  those
without, and from  the past itself, not to m ention protected, copywritten m aterials. That's a terrible idea. And even if you don't think so,
y'all seen the Term inator. Don't do that!
