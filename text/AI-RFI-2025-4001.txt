General Comment
AI has already been used for im personation and forgery, we shouldn't be enabling this further and giving the com panies behind these
destructive tools im m unity from  lawsuits! What we need is m ore regulations on these tools so that they aren't being used to com m it actual
identity fraud, be it for artists who's styles are being perfectly replicated by AI and the generated im ages are being sold as "official works"
from  the artist despite it being a forged AI im age, or even norm al people who are having illicit m aterial being generated of them  to be used
for slander or even blackm ail! The last thing we need is less guardrails on AI when it's already wrecking havoc in the world!
