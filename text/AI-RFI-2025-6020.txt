General Comment
AI is an overhyped technology with huge security risks that profits from  the theft of intellectual property. AI is also a speculative m arket
sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, relying on false prom ises to fool the public. Tax dollars should not be spent on such a poor
investm ent.
