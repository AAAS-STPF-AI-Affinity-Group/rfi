General Comment
This is a terrible proposal. Allowing AI to train on copyrighted work will destroy the livelihoods of creators all around the world. That
includes m ovie directors, cartoonists, m usic com posers, gam e developers, content creators, and stream ers like m yself. Allowing this
proposal to pass will m ean that our ideas and creations will be stolen, thus leading to creative bankruptcy and a severe econom ic crash.
Please reconsider this.
