General Comment
Unfettered training of m achines on copywrited data at large is an econom ic and artistic disaster for Am erica. The ability of artists is not
m ere statistics and what is being called AI is nothing like intelligence. We are letting our creativity be destroyed, which will only lead to
large scale ignorance in the long run. Please do not allow wholesale theft in the nam e of false claim s of charlatans.
