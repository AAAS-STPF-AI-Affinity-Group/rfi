General Comment
AI as m odern society has com es to understand it needs to be regulated and it certainly shouldn't be allowed to train on copyrighted
m aterials without the knowledge, consent, and licensing of said m aterial. It already has been used to do harm  in revenge porn altered
im ages, to auto-deny people seeking to use the health insurance they paid for, and to spread m isinform ation since the m odels that are
already active can't tell right from  wrong. 
Creating an environm ent where the accountability is even less than what already exists won't be good for anyone other than the pockets of
its investors and truly harm ful to all else.
