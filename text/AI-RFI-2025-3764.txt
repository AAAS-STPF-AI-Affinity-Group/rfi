General Comment
This is nothing less than legalized theft in order to funnel m oney into the pockets of Sam  Altm an, a con artist who has yet to dem onstrate a
single actual use case for his product. If you choose to overlook any and all issues pertaining to art itself, this will do nothing but enrich a
thief and help to im proverish Am erican artists, weakening a sector of our own econom y and giving no public good in return. Plus it
establishes a slippery slope when it com es to creative rights, encouraging book publishers and m ovie studios to leave the USA and go to
other countries where their rights will be protected.
Generative AI is a grift akin to NFTs, a solution in search of a problem . This will only weaken our nation and m ake us MORE vulnerable,
not less.
