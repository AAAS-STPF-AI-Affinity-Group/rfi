General Comment
AI should not have im m unity from  copyright infringem ent. Copyright law is crucial because it protects the rights of creators, incentivizes
innovation and creativity, and ensures fair usage and distribution of intellectual property, ultim ately benefiting both creators and the public.
Please do not do this.
