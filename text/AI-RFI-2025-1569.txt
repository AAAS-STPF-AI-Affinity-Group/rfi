General Comment
Corporations are not entitled to profit from  stealing people's artwork and data. AI already poses a m ajor national security risk due to
m isinform ation, disinform ation, deepfakes, and AI-powered scam s. Without strong safeguards, these risks will only grow, underm ining
public trust, election integrity, and econom ic stability. The AI Action Plan m ust prioritize protecting individual rights, data privacy, and
national security over unchecked corporate profits.
