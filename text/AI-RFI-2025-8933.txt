General Comment
A.I. should follow copyright regulations just like anything else would, without perm ission it is effectively stealing content from  people who
m ake it, hiding the owner(s) of the original work and m arking it as it's own.
In this sense, A.I. that does not follow copyright is akin to plagiarism , and should be treated as such. 
Alternatively, A.I. should be created with perm ission and credit to the people who's works are included in it's m aking, so that those
who'se work are in an A.I., are also credited for it's creation.
