General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to Am erica's present, nor its future. As it stands, bad actors see generative algorithm s (com m only
referred to as AI) as a way to replace creative individuals and team s. Replacing creatives with generative algorithm s rem oves people from
work environm ents and the econom y, and is factually not up to the task of creating; generative algorithm s can only regurgitate
com binations of what is fed into them , a practice that is already exploiting copyrighted m aterials and creatives without any com pensation.
Generative algorithm s as they are function as theft m achines, and governm ent legitim ization of them  is disgusting and im m oral. The nation
MUST follow current copyright laws and condem n generative algorithm s as what they are, theft and regurgitation.
