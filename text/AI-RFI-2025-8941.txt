General Comment
AI should never be allowed to have a place in the future of the US, or the future of hum anity as a whole. AI has only taken away from
hum anity, it has ruined the dream s of genuine hum an artists and workers who want to have a successful career, as m ore com panies are
deciding to use AI over hiring hum an workers. AI has been used to sexually abuse those who are unfortunate enough to have fake
pornography created of them , which is absolutely disgusting. There is no correct or ethical use of AI in our future, and if it is allowed to be
able to legally steal from  any source, it will only lead us to a certain doom . Stop trying to take advantage of the people and LISTEN to
them , get yourselves together and shut this awful plan down if you care about the future of your country and hum anity as a whole.
