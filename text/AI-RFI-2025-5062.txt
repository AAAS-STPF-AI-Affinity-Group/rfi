General Comment
Understand that the use of artifical intelligence is NOT the sam e as hum an works or creative works. Just because I put the "Mona Lisa"
into an art prom pt and it gives m e an A.I. version of the sam e work does not m ake it the sam e "Mona Lisa" as originally created.
In the sam e way we have lim its and restrictions on fair use, I feel it's only right to acknowledge and em phasize that fair use for creatives
and those who m ake their own content should be honored.
By allowing any A.I. work based on the works of others, while altering is not directly fair use and in fact is extrem ely insulting and
degrading to those who do create. It is also not honoring the fair use standard for those who m ake their own statem ents, art, film ography,
etcetera.
One exam ple is a presidential speech. If you allow A.I. to be deem ed by itself fair use, the public m ay then alter, twist and reproduce the
speech, altering it's words and m essaging for m illions to hear and it would go unquestioned due to it being 'fair use' even if the clips and
video of the speech and even m any phrases and words are the sam e.
We cannot allow com puters to replace hum an craft. It's inhum ane and m ore over inhum an.
Thank you for your tim e.
