Key Strengths of the AI Action Plan: Encourages Private Sector Growth – The repeal of previous 
regulations removes barriers that may have slowed AI research, development, and deployment in 
the U.S. Enhances National Security – AI has significant implicatio ns for defense, intelligence, and 
cybersecurity. Prioritizing security measures ensures the U.S. maintains an edge over adversaries. 
Fosters Open Innovation & Competition – By reducing restrictive policies, the plan incentivizes both 
established companies and startups to compete in AI -driven advancements. Aligns with Strategic 
AI Priorities – The policy covers crucial topics such as AI hardware, explainability, cybersecurity, 
data privacy, and model security. Promotes International Competitiveness – Strengthening 
America’s AI leadership through strategic R&D investments and policy shifts will help maintain its 
dominance in the global AI landscape. Potential Improvements: Ethical Considerations & Safety – 
While reducing regulatory burdens is beneficial for in novation, the plan should include safeguards 
to prevent unethical AI applications, such as bias in decision -making algorithms or autonomous 
systems misuse. Workforce Development – Investing in AI education and workforce training will be 
essential to ensure  the U.S. has the skilled professionals necessary for this rapidly evolving field. 
Public-Private Collaboration – A balanced approach that encourages government collaboration 
with private industry and academia can enhance AI development while ensuring resp onsible use. 
Review Against the AI Action Plan While the AI Action Plan intends to promote American leadership 
in artificial intelligence, the repeal of regulatory safeguards and the focus on deregulation raise 
concerns about potential risks to public inte rest, privacy, and ethical AI development. The previous 
AI executive order (EO 14110) focused on ensuring safe, secure, and trustworthy AI, and removing 
those measures may lead to unintended negative consequences. Key Concerns with the AI Action 
Plan: Lack  of Guardrails for AI Ethics & Safety – The removal of regulations could lead to unchecked 
AI deployment, increasing risks related to bias, misinformation, and misuse. Weakening Consumer 
& Data Protections – Previous regulations aimed to safeguard privacy and security in AI 
applications. Stripping these protections could lead to excessive data collection and exploitation 
by corporations. Cybersecurity & AI Threats – Without sufficient oversight, AI models could be 
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to security breaches and national security risks. Risk of 
Corporate Monopoly & AI Exploitation – Loosening restrictions may disproportionately benefit large 
tech companies, limiting opportunities for smaller innovators and startups. Potential for AI 
Workforce Displacement – Rapid AI adoption without oversight could lead to widespread job 
automation and worker displacement without adequate retraining programs. Recommendations for 
a More Balanced Approach: Maintain Certain AI Regulations – A balanced regulato ry framework 
that ensures safety without overburdening the private sector should be considered. Stronger AI Risk 
Management & Accountability – Policies should include mandatory risk assessments for high -
impact AI systems, similar to global AI governance ap proaches (e.g., the EU AI Act). Government & 
Industry Collaboration – Public-private partnerships should be encouraged to ensure innovation 
aligns with ethical AI development and security standards.
