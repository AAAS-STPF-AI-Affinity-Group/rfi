General Comment
Speaking as a professional fiction writer, I regard generative AI as theft—of m y work specifically. My own writing has been used without
m y consent to create value for a private corporation, for which I received no apology or com pensation. But even if com pensation had
been offered, I would not have given consent, because I believe wholehearted that generative AI is a cancerous scam  on society as a
whole. It’s a grift. It’s anti-social and anti-hum an. People broadly do not like or want it. It should not be part of our future.
