General Comment
As a technology worker, I do not want AI to be propped up by special governm ent rules and governm ent spending. The bubble is going
to burst and take m any com panies with it, and when it does I do not also want m y tax m oney going down the drain. Rather than
encouraging com petition, these regulations will PREVENT innovation by giving them  a special dispensation to not play by the sam e rules
that the rest of us do. AI, or at least "AI" as defined by the com panies doing a public relations blitz, is not the future.
As a creative, the steps and theft these com panies have adm itted to doing is a gigantic m oral evil, and if they were not being shielded from
the consequences artificially, they would not be as successful as they have been.
