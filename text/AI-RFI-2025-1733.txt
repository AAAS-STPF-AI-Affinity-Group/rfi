General Comment
As an artist, gam e developer, and overall creative person, this will create a future for USA that will actively fight those who innovate and
create. The current direction AI has been heading in is a dangerous path, and needs to be regulated, contained, and ensure safety for
creators of all kinds. This action plan would NOT be for the people of Am erica.
