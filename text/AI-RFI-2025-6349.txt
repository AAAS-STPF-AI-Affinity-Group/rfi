Federal Register, Day, Date, Request for Comments) Docket No.: FR Doc. 2025 -
02305  
Dear Officer  Plimpton : 
As a member of the public, I am offering my comments to the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy  (“OSTP”) in response to the request for comments related to the Office’s inquiry on the 
development of the AI Action Plan.  
As explained further in my below responses, I maintain several policy positions regarding the 
priorities of the AI Action Plan. First,  the development of the AI Action Plan should a ddres s the 
energy consumption of power plants for AI Development and Use . Second, the development of 
the AI Action Plan should consider r esearch and development in materials characterization for 
AI development . Third , the development of the AI Action Plan should a dapt patent law and 
policy to AI to ensure incentives for the development and appropriate use of AI .  
I. Addressing Energy Consumption of Power Plants for AI Development
and Use
1.Introduction.
The growth of artificial intelligence (AI)  technologies comes with surging energy
demands , particularly in the infrastructure that supports  AI’s development and use --data centers . 
These data centers, essential for powering AI development and applications, are  placing 
significant pressure on the nation’s energy sources including fossil fuel -based sources. The 
electricity demand in data centers mainly stems from computing and cooling. First, AI’s 
development require s massive  computational power , for example when dealing with large 
datasets  or running complex AI models, such as those used in materials discovery . The high  
computational demands significantly increase  energy consumption , as more powerful servers are 
used to process data . Second, cooling technologies are  needed to manage the heat produced by 
the dense concentration of data center equipment . As data center s and their equipment grow , 
cooling demands intensify, often relying on water from already stressed watershed areas .  


 2 As AI models continue to grow larger and more complex , so too will their energy 
demands. The grow th in energy consumption raises economic and pollutant concerns, both of 
which pose challenges to national energy security  and independence. As such, addressing these 
energy demands without compromising energy stability, affordability, or the environment has 
become a pressing priority .  
 
2. Importance of Addressing Energy Consumption for AI Development and Use  
 
Economic considerations of rising energy costs : The increasing demand for electricity to power 
AI-related data centers is likely to lead to higher electricity prices, putting pressure on consumers 
and businesses. As AI infrastructure expands , fossil -fuel-powered plants , currently the primary 
energy source for much of this infrastructure , will need to burn more coal or natural gas to 
generate additional  electricity. In response to the growing demand, p ower plants may need to 
upgrad e or expand their infrastru cture, leading to increased capital expenditures . These h igher 
fuel consumption and capital expenditures contribute to rising electricity prices , which can 
directly impact consumers and industries that heavily involve AI in their operations. Businesses 
that use AI in their daily  functions  may experience  increased operational costs, which can reduce  
their profit margins  and global competitiveness.  
 
Pollutant considerations : Fossil -fuel power plants to meet the energy demands of AI 
development emit harmful substances , such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate 
matter, all of which are regulated under the  Clean Air Act. To mitigate these conventional 
pollutions and carbon dioxide , power plants install emission -control technologies , such as carbon 
capture technologies, scrubbers, and desulfurization  systems . However , these technologies often 
require a portion of the plant’s energy output to operate that increase s operational cost s and 
reduc e the overall energy efficiency . For instance, the energy dedicated to carbon capture 
processes, including energy -intensive steps like recharging the chemicals to separate carbon 
dioxide , cannot be sold to the grid . As a result,  power plants may need to raise electricity prices  
to offset these added operational costs . This  makes power plants challenging  to adopt carbon 
capture technologies  at scale.   
 
Energy Security and Independence : The  increasing reliance on fossil fuels  for AI -related power 
consumption  can heighten  domestic energy dependence and vulnerability to global market 
fluctuations. To meet the rising energy demands of conventional and emerging technologies like 
AI, a reliable and affordable energy supply  is essential . Therefore , this reliance needs to be 
managed efficien tly. 
 
3. Suggested Action for A Balanced Approach to Energy Efficiency for AI Infrastructure  
 
Energy Efficiency Improvements : Support the development and implementation of pollution -
control technologies that improve the energy efficiency of power plants support ing AI 
infrastructure. This includes integrating emissions control technologies like carbon capture  and 
ensuring that cost -efficiency and operational viability are not compromised.  A commonly used 
metric to assess the economic aspect of these technologies is energy use share, which measures 
the percentage of a power plant's energy output dedicated to the carbon capture process. A high 
energy use share could indicate low operational e fficiency due to the additional energy required 


 3 for carbon capture and separation, impacting a plant’s economic viability. However, a low energy 
use share does not necessarily equate to greater energy efficiency, as it overlooks the 
technological efficiency of the carbon capture process itself, in terms  of the energy consumption 
per unit of carbon dioxide captured.   
Balancing the operational efficiency of these technologies with their ability to effectively 
reduce emission s is key to making them both economically and environmentally viable. One 
element of this strategy is finding an optional balance point between operational efficiency and 
technological efficiency in emission control systems in terms of energy efficiency. Fo r example, 
just as limiting the amount of power use d in AI training and processing helps reduce energy 
consumption, power plants can limit emission  control efforts to a balanced range. Rather than 
pushing for a nearly 100% emissions capture, which can be excessively energy -intensive and 
costly, a targeted, lower percentage of carbon dioxide absorption can be set that balances 
technological efficiency  with operational costs. By taking into account both operational and 
technological efficiency, such approach can offer a more balanced pathway to improv ing energy 
efficiency in power plants supporting AI infrastructures without overburdening the system wit h 
emissions control technologies that unnecessarily increase costs for consumers . 
 
Diversifying Energy Sources  and technologies  for power  infrastructure : Encourage the 
integration  of an energy mix that include s solar and geothermal , while also leveraging energy 
storage technologies to enhance power supply reliability and flexibility. This can include 
incorporating energy storage technologies such as lithium -ion batteries to ensure continuous 
uptime, which is crucial for AI workloads  during power outages or disruptions. An example can 
be drawn from Google’s use of scaled lithium -ion batter y backup units in its data centers as a 
reliable power sourcei. By combining different energy sources with energy storage technologies, 
AI infrastructure can better manage price volatility in fossil fuel markets and improve energy 
security and independence.  
 
II. Addressing  Research and Development in Materials Characterization for 
AI Development  
 
1. Introduction  
 
The AI action plan should recognize the key role of materials science, particularly materials 
characterization, in advancing AI technologies. Materials characterization techniques provide 
essential insights into the structural, properties of materials, which are fundamental for 
innovating and optimizing AI hardware, as well as enabling AI systems to reach their full 
potential.  
First, AI needs Advanced Materials for Progress. AI systems, particularly in areas like 
quantum computing, depend on innovations in material properties to enhance performance. For 
example, in quantum computing, the performance of qubits is deeply linked to the properties of 
the materials used. Techniques like scanning probe microscopy are essential for understanding 
mate rials at the atomic and subatomic levels. These methods allow for the detailed examination 
of materials, enabling the design of hardware —such as chips, sensors, and memory devices —
that supports next -generation AI technologies. Without these insights, the h ardware powering AI 
will not be optimized, ultimately limiting AI’s capabilities.   


 4 Second, AI’s  power is greatly amplified when coupled with the ability to predict and 
optimize materials’ behavior at scale. Microscopy techniques like SPM can offer the high -
resolution, data -rich insights required to train machine learning models . These models, in turn, 
predict the behavior of n ew materials including those that are better suited for AI applications. 
Therefore, fostering R&D in materials characterization is key  to ensur ing AI models have the 
comprehensive data need ed to make more accurate  predictions and drive advancements in 
materials discovery and design.  
 
2. Importance of Addressing Research and Development in the Area of Materials 
Characterization  
 
National Security : Materials characterization is vital for enhancing U.S. national security, 
particularly as AI technologies and advanced materials intersect with energy systems. For 
instance, microscopy techniques like scanning probe microscopies reveal structural and 
electronic properties, as well as the electric field information of perovskite -based photovoltaic 
systems . Surface and interface characterization tools help understand the interfaces between 
perovskite materials and traditional electronic mat erials. This understanding of material 
properties at the atomic and device levels forms a quantitative basis for the development of 
predictive models like AI to design materials with targeted properties, such as those suitable for 
energy applications. By s trengthening materials characterization, the U.S. developing advanced 
materials critical to meet the U.S.’s national goals.  
 
National Competitiveness and Technological Leadership : Strengthening the research and 
development in materials characterization helps ensure U.S. leadership in AI and technological 
innovation. As the performance of AI systems heavily rel ies on hardware such as processors, 
memory, and sensors, understanding the atomic and device levels of materials becomes essential 
for optimizing performance and driving technological advancements. This understanding enables 
the design of advanced materials f or AI hardware a nd facilitates the development of predictive 
models powered by AI that can guide the design of materials with specific, targeted properties. 
Maintaining leadership in materials characterization ensures that the U.S. remains at the forefront 
of AI developme nt and global technological competitiveness.  
 
3. Suggested Action for Strengthening Research and Development in Materials 
Characterization  
 
To ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in the development of AI and AI -driven 
materials discovery and design, the AI action plan needs to support research networks, including 
the National Labs and universities. These research networks play a key r ole in advancing the 
nation’s foundational technological capabilities, including materials characterization, necessary 
for AI innovation. This can include the design, development, and deployment of new materials 
characterization techniques and surface char acterization techniques. This can also include 
reviewing the adequacy of current research infrastructure at National Labs and universities and 
expanding such capabilities to ensure sufficient foundational technological capabilities to 
solidify U.S. leaders hip in AI development and use.  
 


 5 III. Adapting Patent Law and Policy to AI to Ensure Incentives for the 
Development and Appropriate  Use of AI  
 
1. Introduction  
 
As technology advances, especially with AI, it is essential to ensure  that our patent 
system remains strong, and adaptable, and continues to incentivize innovation. The cost and 
complexity of developing AI are rising , making it  critical to protect inventors’ intellectual 
property. Patents have long been  the engine driving innovation that benefit s society. But as AI 
becomes more involved in the invention process, questions like who owns the rights to AI -
assisted or AI -generated inventions could introduce  uncertainty in the patent system . If not 
timely addressed, this uncertainty could undermine confidence in the patent system and slow 
progress in both AI development and its appropriate use in innovation . 
 
2. Importance of Addressing Patent Law and Policy to Balance AI Development and Use   
 
Impact on AI Development : Current inventorship criteria, which require a significant human 
contribution to claim patent rights, have been effective in motivating AI developers to advance 
AI technologies. Today, AI systems still rely on human developers to design, train, and guide AI 
models to perform tasks. For example, AI is used to predict material properties for materials 
discovery, a process that requires training AI systems on experimental and computational data of 
intrinsic materials information. This human involvement is cru cial, as it enables AI to make 
predictions about the functional properties of new materials, thereby providing AI developers 
with the prospect of obtaining  patents for their advancements.  
 
Impact on the Ethical Use of AI in Innovation : AI’s evolving capability, particularly  in inventi ve 
processes, challenges traditional ideas of inventorship and ethical innovation. Currently, AI 
systems are tools that assist human inventors in the inventive  process . But as they become more 
autonomous  determining who should be credited as the inventor becomes complex. For example, 
when AI advances to the extent of autonomously running experiment s in robotic laboratories for 
materials design, future AI users ma y find their contribution too insignificant to qualify for 
inventorship.  Without clear guideline that takes into account to the pace of AI technologies, there 
is a risk that human inventors could be denied rightful recognition for AI -involved innovations, 
discouraging the use of AI in scientific progress. Additionally, the lack of clear guidelines around 
AI-driven discoveries  could lead to manipulative practices , where human researchers may inflate 
their role in AI -driven discoveries to meet  inventorship  requirements . Such practices undermine 
the true potential of AI and can stifle genuine innovation.   
 
3. Suggested Action for Addressing  Patent Law and Policy to Balance AI Development and 
Use 
 
Strengthen and Modernize the Patent System:  To maintain U.S. leadership in global 
competitiveness , it is essential to ensure that patent law and policy evolve to reflect the growing 
capabilities of AI and its role in the invention process . This can include  regularly assessing AI’s 
capabilities and its impact on innovation and adapting the patent system accordingly.  
 


 6 Promote Ethical Practices in AI Innovation : Encourage the development of ethical standards for 
AI use in innovation . This can  includ e ensuring transparency in how AI is employed in the 
inventi ve process  and prevent ing the manipulation of inventorship by inflating human 
contributions in AI -driven innovations . Additionally, enhancing public understanding of the 
ethical implications of AI in scientific discovery  can help ensure that AI contributes to innovation 
in ways that align with societal values and ethic al standards .
