It's dangerous. I truly believe without a doubt in my mind that it will do more harm than good, 
and it could be dangerous if people in the government are reckless with this idea. A.I not only 
steals our information, takes away jobs, is harmful to the envir onment (not that the government 
cares), and is the leading cause of critical thinking skills, but it also makes us less human. But 
those I worry for the most are those who are born into this generation. A.It stifles the imagination 
of children and family c onnection. Little kids who have cell phones already seem to be void of 
emotions; imagine what this could do. A.I should in no way be used in school systems. (not that 
the government cares about our countries schools either). People shouldn't be able to hav e easy 
access to A.I, it should only be used in a career setting such as labs and it should only be used by 
jobs that absolutely need it. I do believe that it can help in medicle and engineering studies, but it 
should not be all over the internet where adu lts and kids can use it recklessly. It has already 
stolen too much - even artists who think that their jobs are safe from a.i are disproven. I'm 
terrified of everything that has to do with this, and I feel everyone around my become more and 
more isolated ar ound me, even my teachers who are using these tools to create assignments. The 
funny this is A.I is mostly wrong and is not a good studying source. I was suicidal before, but 
now I truly know that there is nothing. Nothing good will happen in the future if  nothing is done 
about this. And the government simply does not care, and it's upsetting, but no body will listen. 
We where doomed from the start. A.I is definantly being put in the wrong hands. - Addison
