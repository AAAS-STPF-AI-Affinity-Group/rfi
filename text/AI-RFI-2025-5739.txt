General Comment
The concept that Generative AI is im m une to copyright law is absurd on m any levels. The Disney's and Netflix's of the country will have
m any ways to enforce their copyrights on these theft m achines. Many Am erican sm all businesses / independent owners will be the ones
who suffer this loss of protection. What functional difference is there between AI Art, AI novels, or AI Law briefs? If you would not trust
som eone with an AI Lawyer, why would you trust them  with an AI "Artist" or "Author"? Many Am ericans will be m ajorly financially hurt if
they cannot get what they are owed from  com pany's trying to steal from  them .
