General Comment
If this executive order passes, this will be a disaster for creatives and nobody will want to create in the USA anym ore. This is terrible for
business and it would be a nightm are dealing with the likes of Disney, Universal, CBS, and other m ajor nam es in the arts. Do NOT let this
pass.
