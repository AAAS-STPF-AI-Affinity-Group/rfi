General Comment
AI does not have any benefit to current nor the future of Am erica. It directly violates the Fifth Am endm ent, one of the first 10 this country
was built upon. “Private property shall not be taken for public use, without just com pensation,” AI directly takes the private property of
Am ericans to generate its content with zero com pensation for them . This inherently infringes on the rights and freedom s of Am ericans, to
be able to protect and do what they with wish with their own private property. It is exactly the opposite of what Am erica represents and
stands for.
