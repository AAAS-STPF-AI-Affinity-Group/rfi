General Comment
I've worked in writing and gam e developm ent for the last ten years. My livelihood depends on the creative works that I have poured
countless hours into. It is -m y- work, and there is no reason that these big, billion-dollar com panies should NOT have any access to use
m y work in ways that I do not condone. It threatens m y way of life just to give corporations m ore wealth than they need. It's beyond
ridiculous this is som ething people should even have to voice their opinions against.
