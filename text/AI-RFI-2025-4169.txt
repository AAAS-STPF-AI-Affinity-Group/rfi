General Comment
This proposal am ounts to theft of copyrighted works. That is theft of intellectual property. As som eone who holds a copyright, I
vehem ently oppose not only the theft of m y work but also denying m e the ability to redress it in court. That is a violation of m y rights as the
creator of the work. Moreover, this suggests a devaluing of the work done by authors and other copyright holders, and it is a threat to
their livelihoods. Will AI also be able to use tradem arks with im punity? Or will tradem arks rem ain protected? What about patents?
Frankly, if OpenAI can't be profitable without copyright infringem ent, then m aybe it should find a new business m odel.
