General Comment
The rapid rise of generative AI threatens over 100,000 independent content creators—sm all business owners who rely on open digital
access for their livelihoods. AI-driven content delivery risks disrupting their revenue, diluting intellectual property rights, and underm ining
the open web. Am erica’s AI policies m ust foster innovation without sacrificing sm all businesses and independent voices.
Protect Sm all Businesses from  Tech Monopolies
Tech giants like Google are using AI to dom inate content distribution. AI Overviews in search results keep users within their ecosystem ,
bypassing independent creators and cutting off their revenue. This m onopolistic practice threatens livelihoods. OSTP m ust act to protect
sm all businesses, ensuring fair com petition and upholding the free m arket—core Am erican values.
Ensure Ethical AI Use in Search
AI-generated search sum m aries provide inform ation without directing users to original sources, reducing creators' control and
m isrepresenting their work. This loss of traffic weakens their ability to m onetize content. Addressing this issue reaffirm s the governm ent's
com m itm ent to ethical technology and supports creators' rights, reinforcing Am erica’s m oral leadership.
Uphold Intellectual Property and Revenue Protections
Without safeguards, AI tools exploit creators' intellectual property without consent or com pensation, underm ining their rights and
econom ic stability. Protecting IP is essential to preserving creativity, entrepreneurship, and the rule of law—ensuring sm all businesses can
thrive in the digital econom y.
