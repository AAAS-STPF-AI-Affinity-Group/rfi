General Comment
AI does not and should not have a place in the future of the US. AI com panies/AI-affiliated organizations should be held to the rules of the
land and not get a special carve out for harm ing Am ericans and their works. AI is purely hype and ultim ately not necessary for the future
of US interests. The environm ental costs are also an issue, nam ely with energy usage. AI threatens the livelihoods of creatives/creative
industries, which have been in peril due to issues including the use of AI being favored over hum an artists. AI also assists in fabricating
inform ation, including but not lim ited to deepfake child pornography and false docum entation, deceiving the general populace.
