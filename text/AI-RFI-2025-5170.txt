General Comment
I am  deeply concerned about the ram pant use of AI stealing copyrighted m aterial in what is essentially glorified plagiarism  for program s
that have proven m ediocre and ill-equipped to perform  the tasks being billed to the public. We do not need investm ent in a technology
built entirely on the piracy of other works with absolutely no credit given, nor do we need the catastrophic effects on the environm ent and
our com m unities that will surely result from  the deploym ent of such faulty and dangerous system s. No one asked for AI that steals
everything and churns out cheap, low-quality copies that only serves to flood our senses with lies and deceit while a tiny handful of people
get rich off of piracy. The U.S. governm ent should not have any involvem ent in generative AI in any regard and should instead seek to lim it
or ban its use as the business m odel sets a dangerous precedent with horrific consequences for the public and the world.
