General Comment
Giving AI special treatm ent in regards to copyright law is disgusting and hypocritical. No com pany or tech should be above the law, and
neither should OPENAI. To disregard the hard work of artists, m usicians, and creatives is a slap in the face to the Am erican people. DO
NOT ALLOW AI COMPANYS TO USE OTHERS WORK WITH OUT PROPER PERMISSIONS.
