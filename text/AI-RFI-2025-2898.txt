General Comment
AI can be a tool for change, but is also destructive in its m ethods. By bypassing regulations com pletely, it opens an avenue for creatives to
be exploited by com panies and reduce the quality of “dom inance” Am erica m ay have currently. AI should follow an ethical approach as
the rest of the world and copyrighted works have to as well, this is not a play for dom inance or technological innovation, but a blatant
m ove for trying to increase the revenue stream  of com panies that are facing pushback after their m agic AI failed consum ers.
If you want Am erica to dom inate, value quality over quantity, put the people and creatives first.
