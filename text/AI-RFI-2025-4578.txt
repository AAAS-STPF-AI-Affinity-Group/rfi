General Comment
The use of AI "trained" on, in m any cases, copyrighted hum an creation, is the ultim ate theft of intellectual property and destruction of
hum an innovation ever seen. AI can create or boil down inform ation but it doesn't understand justice is contact, and is being used for
decisions that have real world im pacts. On top of this, the operation of artificial intelligence requires vast resources that cannot reasonably
be sustained without harm . We should not be encouraging the use of AI nor funding it's developm ent.
