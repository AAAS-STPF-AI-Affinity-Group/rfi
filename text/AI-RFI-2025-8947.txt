General Comment
OpenAI is asking for it to be legal for them  to steal whatever they want. If private citizens can be fined for downloading m ovies, TV
shows, books, or gam es without paying for it then OpenAI should be fined for all of the m ass copyright theft they've done. This is an
openly kleptocratic bill that if it passes will m ake the current adm inistration com plicit in theft on a scale never before seen in history. Any
serious person would strike this down as overtly unconstitutional and as being som ething that steals from  people and corporations without
com pensating them .
