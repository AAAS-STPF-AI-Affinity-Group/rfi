General Comment
While AI technologies certainly have great potential, the blatant violation of copyright law by AI tech com panies m ust be cracked down
on and the rights to one's own work protected. Stealing anyone's work in any context is wrong, even in the pursuit of m aintaining
'dom inance' in the field of AI. There are countless better and ethical ways that AI tech can be used and developed without infringing on
the rights of writers, artists, m usicians, content creators, and copyright holders. There are copyright free resources out there, m any used
by artists and content creators them selves, that could be used to train AI datam odels without theft or exploitation, and the com panies that
research and develop said tech can easily reach out to request usage of certain copyrighted m aterial from  the rightful copyright holders for
AI developm ent. 
Anyone claim ing that upholding copyright law and the rights of creators som ehow im pedes on the developm ent of AI tech is woefully
m isinform ed at best or actively cruel and spiteful towards creators and the hard work they put in at worst. Please, uphold copyright law
and hold AI com panies accountable. It will help everyone, including openai and other ai tech com panies in the long run. Regulation is not
the devil, it is the ground we stand on and orient ourselves by.
