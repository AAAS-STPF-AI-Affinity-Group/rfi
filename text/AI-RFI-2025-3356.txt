General Comment
While I can understand the potential value of artificial intelligence in m any fields, I believe that generative AI which is trained through the
theft of copyrighted m aterial and only produces soulless facsim iles of the art it was fed has no place in Am erica's future.
Generative AI sits atop a bubble that has consum ed hundreds of billions of dollars with nothing to show for it. If the only way for this
industry to be profitable is for it to be given a blank check to steal whatever m edia they want for training data then there is no point this
industry existing in the first place.
