General Comment
Any AI policy needs to take into account the consent of the people whose content is taken into any AI system . In short, the "hum an
flourishing" aspect will not happen if AI com panies are given the right to scrape and process and use content online or offline without lim it,
because it will both discourage people from  creating things as well as put artists and writers who depend on creating written and visual
works out of work. Governm ent restrictions and oversight are not overly burdensom e, but rather the best way to m ake sure that the
interests of the Am erican people are taken into account over those of AI com panies looking to harvest the work of the Am erican people
for the sake of their profits.
