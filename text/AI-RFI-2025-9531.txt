General Comment
This is a m oronic m ove am ong an entire forty-seven car pile up of m oronic m oves, and only the m ost willfully ignorant kool-aid guzzling
sycophants would even entertain the idea that this is in any way going to be anything besides a cluster of copyright lawsuits slam m ing into
dozens of m achine learning com panies that will alm ost im m ediately fizzle out and be replaced by dozens m ore until the industry gets bored
with "a.i." and m oves on to the next fad. Leaving us stuck with the bill and the m ess AGAIN.
