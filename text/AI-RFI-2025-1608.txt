Request for Information concerning AI Action Plan; L os Angeles County 
Business Federation (BizFed) Comments
 
Dear Mr. D’Souza:  
The Los Angeles County Business Federation (BizFed) submits the following 
comments to the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program National Coordination Office (NITRD NCO) regarding 
the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan (Plan). BizFed 
appreciates the opportunity to offer comments and looks forward to working with federal leaders throughout the development of the Plan. 
LA County Business Federation (BizFed) Background 
The Los Angeles County Business Federation (BizFed) is a powerful, 
grassroots alliance that unites chambers of commerce, trade associations, minority business groups, economic development organizations, business improvement districts, and other business networks to champion policies and initiatives that strengthen California’s economy. 
BizFed was founded in 2008 by Founding Chairman David Fleming and  
Founding CEO Tracy Hernandez in response to the financial crisis. Their 
vision was to create a unified, nonpartisan voice for the Southern California business community. Seventeen years later, BizFed has grown into a 
formidable advocacy powerhouse, representing over 420,000 employers 
and 5 million employees across the state. Our coalition includes more than 400 board members spanning every major industry sector. 
BizFed harnesses the power of collective action to explore all sides of critical 
business issues, ensuring policies are thoroughly vetted before action is 
taken. BizFed advocates, mobilizes, and educates business leaders on how to effectively engage in the policymaking process. By equipping businesses 


 Los Angeles County Business Federation / 1150 South Olive Street, Floor 10, Los Angeles, CA 90015 / T:  / www.bizfed.org  with the tools to advocate for themselves, we work to drive economic 
growth, job creation, and long-term prosperity for California. 
We appreciate the administration’s commitment to fostering American 
innovation and ensuring that the United States remains a global leader in technology. The focus on advancing artificial intelligence (AI) while balancing responsible oversight reflects a strong dedication to both economic growth 
and ethical considerations. BizFed shares the administration’s ongoing 
efforts to support small businesses, recognizing that they are the backbone of our economy and essential to the nation's continued success.  
Support for Small Businesses and AI Adoptio n	
With the recent appointment of Kelly Loeffler as the 28th Administrator of 
the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) there is renewed optimism for small business advocacy and support. 
As AI becomes an integral part of business operations, it is important to 
ensure that small businesses have the resources to adopt and integrate AI tools effectively. The cost of AI implementation can be a significant barrier, 
with businesses often facing expenses ranging from $5,000 to over 
$500,00 0, depending on complexity. 
To align with the administration’s goal of expanding economic opportunity, we encourage the SBA to develop grant programs and educational initiatives 
that help small businesses leverage AI. Additionally, a federal tax credit for 
businesses implementing AI could incentivize adoption while ensuring that companies of all sizes remain competitive in an evolving economy. 
Need for a National AI Framewor k	
We appreciate the administration’s commitment to fairness and inclusion in AI applications. However, BizFed opposes extraneous overregulation on 
automated decision-making tools (ADMTs) and believes that a cohesive, 
national framework must be developed at the federal level. AI-driven processes are increasingly shaping hiring, housing, and other critical decisions, making it essential to establish safeguards that prevent bias and discrimination. However, a patchwork of state-by-state regulations would 
create confusion, increase compliance costs, and stifle innovation. A 
national AI framework would provide businesses with the certainty they need to innovate without facing a patchwork of state regulations that could increase compliance costs and create unnecessary burdens. 


 Los Angeles County Business Federation / 1150 South Olive Street, Floor 10, Los Angeles, CA 90015 / T:  / www.bizfed.org  The business community is particularly concerned about state-level AI 
regulations, such as those being proposed in California from a number of 
agencies, which have been projected, if implemented, could result in 
significant financial challenges, job losses, and reduced innovation. Furthermore, we encourage federal agencies to clarify the applicability of existing laws to AI technology, minimizing the need for duplicative 
regulations and ensuring a streamlined and effective approach to innovation 
and oversight. A unified federal approach would ensure fairness and clarity while maintaining the United States’ leadership in AI development. 
Investment in AI Education and Cybersecurit y	
As technology evolves, it is essential to invest in AI education and cybersecurity. By supporting AI-focused curricula in schools, the 
administration can prepare the next generation for a future in which AI 
literacy is crucial. Likewise, expanding cybersecurity education and resources for businesses will help safeguard critical infrastructure and sensitive data in an increasingly digital world. 
Developing an AI -Skilled Workforc e	
The demand for AI skills in the U.S. labor market has been steadily rising since 2010, with an acceleration in recent years. Approximately 25% of 
U.S. tech job listings in 2025 require AI skills, indicating a significant shift in the job market. However, there is a notable skills gap, with 68% of 
business leaders struggling to attract adequate talent to manage 
their AI  solutions. Investing in employee development ensures that the 
workforce is equipped with the latest skills and knowledge, driving 
companies forward. Leveraging employees' skills to engage in meaningful work may also lead to greater employee satisfaction and retention. 
To address this, we recommend the following initiatives: 
•Educational Partnerships: Collaborate with educational institutions
to integrate AI training into curricula, ensuring that students areprepared for the evolving job market.
•Workforce Development Programs: Establish programs thatprovide current workers with opportunities to upskill or reskill in AI
technologies, making them more adaptable to technological
advancements.


 Los Angeles County Business Federation / 1150 South Olive Street, Floor 10, Los Angeles, CA 90015 / T:  / www.bizfed.org  •Public Awareness Campaigns: Promote the importance of AI
literacy to encourage individuals across various sectors to pursue AI
education and training. BizFed has a 501(c)3 arm named the BizFed
Institute, BizFed Institute educates, engages and equips business owners
with the necessary knowledge, connections and resources needed to create a
robust regional economy and strong communities.
By implementing these strategies, we can build a workforce capable of 
harnessing AI's potential, thereby enhancing productivity and maintaining 
global competitiveness. 
BizFed Pu lse Poll 
Los Angeles County boasts the largest economy of any county in the nation, 
serving as a vital engine for the U.S. economy through its diverse industries, including entertainment, manufacturing, and international trade. Each year, BizFed conducts a comprehensive survey of the California business

Conclusio n	
Thank you for your dedication to fostering an environment where businesses can thrive in an AI centered era. We appreciate the administration’s continued work in this space and look forward to seeing the impact of a thoughtful and business-friendly AI action plan because business makes the United States work.
