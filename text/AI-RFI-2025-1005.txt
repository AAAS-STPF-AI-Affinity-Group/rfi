General Comment
Hello, 
I am  writing to encourage a focus on reducing energy consum ption and increasing efficiency as a highest priority policy action that should
be in the new AI Action Plan. AI data centers are highly resource intensive and are being built and operated at a tim e when our energy
and water usage should be dropping sharply in order to give young Am ericans a livable future. In order to be worthy of the high resource
usage, AI should only be used to solve our greatest problem s, not be a ubiquitous and superfluous internet enhancer. 
Data centers should m itigate the carbon em issions associated with AI's energy consum ption by transitioning to renewable energy sources
such as solar or wind and adopting energy-efficient practices. AI m ust have net zero em issions to keep pace with international clim ate
goals. If AI does not com ply with net-zero em issions, it will only serve to hasten and m agnify hum an suffering rather than being the boon is
proports to be. 
Unless governm ents are using AI to redesign their power grid and its transm ission, to inform  m ass reforestation efforts, and com pelling the
protection of the Colorado River, the current allocation of precious and irreplaceable resources to AI data centers negates its outputs. 
Thank you for taking m y com m ent, 
KC Petersen
