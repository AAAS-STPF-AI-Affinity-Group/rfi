General Comment
This cannot be allowed to happen. AI doesn’t and shouldn’t have a place in the future of the US in any way or form . AI com panies
absolutely should be held to the rules of the land and should not be getting a special carve out or exception for harm ing Am ericans and
their works. And finally, frankly AI is purely hype and ultim ately not going to be of actual m ajor use to anyone.
