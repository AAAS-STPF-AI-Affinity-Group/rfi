To whom it may concern,
As a working American artist, I am absolutely horrified by OSTPâ€™s plan to give American AI companies immunity
from creatives and other working Americans from retaliating against their overreach of copyright laws. Artists arerequired to adhere to strict rules and guidelines in order to avoid violating copyright laws. The idea that theseliterally inhuman systems would be given immunity from that same system in order to make it easier to take our jobsaway is stomach turning.
Do not pass this legislation, you are throwing real human beings under the bus in pursuit of abstract commercial
goals.
Listen very carefully to what workers are telling you, you are very close to destroying the ability of millions of
Americans to make a living. We will not take kindly to this kind of treatment.
