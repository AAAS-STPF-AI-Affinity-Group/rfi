General Comment
So-called Generative AI is a dead-end field that will only contribute to a nationwide decline in arts and science. Rather than providing
solutions to real world problem s, it will only allow businesses to cut costs by replacing high-paying creative jobs with low-paying ones
based on correcting low quality AI output. Negating precious copyright protections in order to m aintain dom inance in this field is
counterproductive.
