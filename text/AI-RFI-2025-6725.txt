General Comment
so-called "Generative AI" is a fad, and when it ceases to be the corporate flavor of the m onth, all you'll have written is a way for thieves
and conm en to scam  Am ericans and devalue the arts. this is an absolutely foolish policy, which will bolster growth for a quarter or two,
before creating a dom ino effect of terrible outcom es for a generation. kill it now or rue your legacy.
