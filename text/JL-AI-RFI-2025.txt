JL,  
So-called generative "AI" technology is nothing more than intellectual property theft writ large. 
The products it generates are subpar and cobbled together using stolen data. The information it 
offers is frequently incorrect or outright fabricated. It is a  dying industry that only got this far 
because of corporate interests seeing how it allows them to destroy American jobs and pocket 
more money by slowly poisoning the American creative landscape.
