General Comment
No No No No No No No.
There are plenty of people who are going to be better at eloquence than I am . They're going to have Fancy technical jargon for all the
reasons they don't want AI accessing their data or replacing hum an beings. They're going to explain in very specific term s why AI is bad in
a world that's already in the grips of clim ate crisis due to the dem anded places on are already overtaxed water supplies. 
They're going to talk about how it's inefficient and m ostly regurgitates are worst biases. How and people use it as a shortcut and when that
happens real hum ans get hurt i.e. the student that has been suspended from  Yale over an AI article that has been debunked. 
They're going to give you m ore specific reasons pertaining to whatever the hell it is you want to do with this garbage idea and why it is a
terrible idea. 
You should m aybe listen to them . That's what I do which is why I know any of this at all. 
AI as well as the governm ent need to keep their dam n noses how to m ine and everyone else's business. AI needs to stop being a
convenient shortcut used to replace and harm  people. AI has lim ited use and I recognize this. This is not an effective use of AI and I do
not support it. 
Those are all the fancy words I have. Personally, I don't know why the basic reasons aren't reason enough.
