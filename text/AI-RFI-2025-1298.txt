General Comment
Do not waste any m ore m oney or resources on AI developm ent. The entire schem e runs on intellectual property infringem ent, stealing the
labor of skilled workers in order to replace their jobs cheaply for corporations. It's disastrous drain on our environm ent in term s of
electricity and water consum ption. Our outdated power grid is already struggling to m eet dem and. The scam  artist com panies pushing AI
keep begging for m assive investm ents despite the fact that they know the bubble is bursting, they've adm itting m ore training won't im prove
their m odels, which are worsening due to training on their own shoddy output, consum ers hate and increasingly boycott AI products, and
they will never be profitable as they keep prom ising. I'm  an illustrator whose work has been siphoned up by these theft engines and have
lost work because of it. I've watch m y entire industry as well as other creative trades dry up and lose quality due to being flooded with AI
slop.
