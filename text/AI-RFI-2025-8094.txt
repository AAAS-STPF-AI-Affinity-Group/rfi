General Comment
Generative AI was trained on the im ages/ works of m illions with no input or pay. This gross violation of our property is now used to
com pete with artists, taking jobs away from  artist.
It is possible for Gen AI to be m ade ethically, but currently all m odels are trained on data scrapped from  the internet including copywritten
and tradem arked works.
Measures need to be taken to reduce the already trem endous am ount of dam age unregulated AI has done to not only artists, but public
figures, and others.
Thank you for reading m y m essage.
