General Comment
I do not feel AI belongs in the future of the United States. AI steals from  the livelihood of m yself and others and AI artists m ake profit
from  their stolen work. Unchecked AI will pose an im m inent threat to our nation and the world at large. I urge against this danger and
instead beseech you to consider forcing com panies to invest back into their em ployees and custom ers as they have always prom ised with
trickle down econom ics, but have never lived up to the prom ise of.
