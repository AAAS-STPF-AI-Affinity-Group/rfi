General Comment
AI training on copyrighted m aterials is not fair use and should not be legal. I'm  a science and m edical illustrator, and m y work has been
stolen for AI training. I did not consent to this, and now m y ability to find work is being com prom ised as potential clients choose to use
low-quality AI output trained on m y work instead of hiring m e. Protect artists and other creators, and do not allow AI developers to train
their m odels on our copyrighted works.
