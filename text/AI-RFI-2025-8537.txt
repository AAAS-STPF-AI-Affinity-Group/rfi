General Comment
Generative AI is unethical, inefficient, and frequently inaccurate. Models trained on the work of hum an artists and writers is plagiarism  at
best, and when m onetized content is involved, it escalates to theft. AI strips the soul out of art of all kinds, and returns terrifying inaccurate
results when used for searching - num erous articles have covered the inability of various engines to solve word problem s and accurately
sum m arize inform ation, with som e even providing downright dangerous advice about food and m edicine.
Som e types of m achine learning have genuinely beneficial applications, but generative AI is no substitute for hum an creativity or critical
thinking. If left unchecked, it could result in m any individuals living in their own separate realities based on AI-generated "facts" with
varying degrees of detrim ental results.
AI cannot m ake judgm ent calls or understand the hum an cost or long-term  effects of im portant or difficult decision, so it has no business
being used to evaluate perform ance, resolve insurance claim s, or draft policy. 
It is entirely reasonable for the United States to aspire to be a world leader in the types of m achine-learning that can have valuable
scientific applications, but we cannot allow a profoundly resource-intensive plagiarism  m achine to dom inate our society.
