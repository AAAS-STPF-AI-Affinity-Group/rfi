General Comment
This plan is a transparent attem pt for large corporate entities to obtain federal funding to continue to steal intellectual property from
creatives in an attem pt to underm ine and elim inate hum an workers. Any plan for incorporating LMM or AI m ust include safeguards
against intellectual property theft, reductions in workforce due to im plem entation of the technology, and stringent regulations that allow for
innovation without sacrificing hum an livelihoods and talent. AI should be an aid for hum an workers, not a m ethod for reducing a
workforce. I do not support, and will not support, any incorporation of corporate AI with the US Governm ent unless these stipulations
are m et, and neither should anyone with integrity.
I am  including a variety of articles that provide context and and overview about the various lawsuits that prom inent AI com panies are
currently involved in to further m y point.
