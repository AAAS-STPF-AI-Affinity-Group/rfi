General Comment
I think any illegal content scraping, re-use or reproduction by corporations should be held to the sam e standards as individuals and
prosecutes as virulently as was done to, am ong m any others, Napster users and Aaron Swartz. An even better solution would be to
loosen copyright laws for individuals and im pose a broad tax on corporate usesâ€”this would greatly benefit creators of this valuable
content that should not be treated as free-for-corporate use.
