General Comment
Generative AI is an awful thing that should not be allowed. It only learns by stealing from  artists. Also AI is a speculative m arket sim ilar to
cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and huge legal problem s by enabling them . So if this does pass, then I
guess random  people using AI Generation on say... Disney's properties would be fair gam e.
