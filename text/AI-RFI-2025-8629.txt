General Comment
I'm a human bei ng and I draw and write, and perform, and release son gs and stories, and run a magazine, and make movies - and I 
didn't  have to steal from an yone to do it. This is &^%. Why give a computer more ri ghts than a person has? It's a machine. It's 
nothing. And it's bei ng sold to you by grifters. It will never do what they say it can. (I have also worked in machine learning and I'm 
telling you they are  lying.) Computers don't vote, computers can't be put in jail, and th is particu lar computer program will never earn 
money or create an ything of worth; it's a boondog gle. Rip the carpet out.
