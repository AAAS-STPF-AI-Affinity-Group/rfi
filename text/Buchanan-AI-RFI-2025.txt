As an artist, I firmly believe in the protection of Copyright as it stands against AI. AI scraping 
should be  reserved to only those who gain permission, via the copyright holder, to scrape for AI. 
Removing that protection will suddenly put many jobs in danger of being replaced by AI that could've gone to American Citizens as AI would be able to scrape their content and voices, allow for IPs owned by Americans to suddenly be twisted into scams and cause corporations to lose battles against those who misuse t heir AI, and would throw Fair Use into the gutter. Regulations 
must be made for AI to prevent the loss of protected works.
