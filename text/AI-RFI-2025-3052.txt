General Comment
While i am  personally not an artist, i find giving AI any sort of ability to grow without regulation for thef, and infact giving it im m unity from
such a thing,is not only reprehensible, its also just plain stupid. it kills the envirom ent, floods sites with m isinform ation, and for those of you
voting on this that care about m oney, does not generate any revenue period. its a never ending sinkhole that will continue to swallow all it
can until there's nothing left but itself. it will call for the m urder of governm ent officials and allies of the USA because it was fed a single
com m ent that grew and festered on other stolen m aterial as just a m inor thing that could happen. one of the m ore im portant parts
however, is that it will kill the culture of Am erica without m uch resistance. The culture of a nation is m ade in part by the art that its people
create. from  paintings, to anim ation, to m usic, the diversity and creativity of people com e together to m ake what the rest of the world sees
in a nations culture. and AI will destroy all of it without m issing a beat. It does not create new culture, it kills the old and wears its skin.
The rest of the world will look at an Am erica using nothing but AI to create "new" things, and it will laugh. It will m ock us and dem ean us.
AI is not infite, it will run out. but hum an creativity and inspiration will never die.
