General Comment
As a com puter science professional and person who is integrating LLM technology into software, it is im perative that we lim it the data
being used to train and develop AI technology. The privacy of individual Am ericans and the copyrights of corporations hold m ore value,
and m ust be prioritized above, the training of AI m odels. The technology is a flexible productivity tool but is not an all -encom passing
boon to hum an developm ent. In addition private sector com panies, especially those that are publicly traded, are too beholden to irrational
m arket swings to be trusted with unrestricted personal data access. Regulations around AI developm ent should be increased, not
decreased, and honest appraisals of the com panies involved should be perform ed.
