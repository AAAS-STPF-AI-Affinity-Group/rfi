Re: National Science Foundationâ€™s Request for Information on the Development of an
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
I am sure you have received many emails on all of the bad things about OpenAI such as
stealing the hard work and lively hoods of artists as well as all the environmental destruction itcauses but I am going to speak of the future and the things you have over looked. AI is goingto be the death of art in this country if it continues. It will take everything from the artcommunity and anyone that once inspired artists to create what they love.
I have a sister and she is just finishing up high school. She wanted to be an artist most of her
teen years but now has switched to something else because she believes there will be no futurefor her. Do you have any idea how heartbreaking it is to see someone so young giving up on adream not because she can't but because evil corrupt companies will steal from her instead ofpay her for her work?
I will conclude my email with a brief look into the future. OpenAI survives on stealing from
artists, so what happenes when there are no more artists to steal from? Once they get what theywant and art is dead every project created will look the same. Where there once was color andexpression there will only be grey AI generated works that all look the same. So we need to doall we can to save art in this country.
Thank you for your time and the chance to speak my piece.
