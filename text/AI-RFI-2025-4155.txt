General Comment
I am  a professional software engineer with degrees in Com puter Science, Math and Philosophy and 35 years hands-on experience.
Based on m y direct experiences with existing system s and reviews of perform ance results: While language m odel-based neural networks
can be effective for specific tasks for which they are specifically trained, they have consistently shown poor results in m ost general cases,
and produced harm ful results in m any cases.
From  m y professional experience, these general case system  will not benefit from  m ore training, using larger power plants and m ore GPU
cores or throwing m ore data (like the set of all copyright-protected data) at it. Further, training for specialized tasks doesn't require those
resources either.
I state clearly: NO to all copyright-protected data without specific license.
I would also assert that all legal liability for use of copyright-protected data and *reproducing* sim ilar m aterials can only lie with the
com pany producing the m odels that violate copyright.
