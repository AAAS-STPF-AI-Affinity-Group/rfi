General Comment
My nam e is Ella Bounos and I am  a graduating senior from  Avonworth High School. I researched generative AI's im pact on art for a
sem ester course, and recently studied this adm inistration's viewpoint of AI regulation. Based on m y two m onths of student research, AI
should be heavily m onitored, especially with continuing advancem ents in this technology. While I agree that AI can be used as a tool to
enhance people's work or even help generate ideas, it's also stealing other people's work. In m y research, I talk about copyright when it
com es to AI and art, and one of m y sources questions whether copyright, patent, and tradem ark infringem ent apply to AI creations. In
2022, there was a case of 3 artists whose art styles were stolen by an im age generator. The 3 artists weren't aware that the AI was being
trained to use their art styles. With this being said, I think there should be a copyright infringem ent placed upon AI and a m ore elevated
m onitoring system  when it com es to AI. Not only does generative AI concern artists, it can also put them  out of business, even if AI
generated art isn't considered real art. Please consider m y concerns, thank you.
