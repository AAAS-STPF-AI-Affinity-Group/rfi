General Comment
Maintaining copyright should not be considered an undue burden in the developm ent of AI/LLMs. I work in publishing, and, like m any
other industries, there is no point in developing AI off hum an work, no m atter how helpful the AI m ight be, if it dim inishes hum an hum an
ability to develop their work. AI innovators m ust ensure that their work does not im pinge on the copyright of the people who initially
developed the works. AI developm ent thus far has not been respectful of copyrighted works, and this should be rectified rather than
copyright abandoned.
