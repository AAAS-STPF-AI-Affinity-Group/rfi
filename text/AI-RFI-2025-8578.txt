General Comment
AI cannot be ethically cultivated unless it is properly regulated. It is a necessity to protect both the people in the m om ent and the users of
the future. No AI m odel built on unethically sourced data will be viable for private or com m ercial use.
There m ust be regulation that ensures that all data sourced for any AI m odel is sourced from  those who knowingly consent to having their
data trained on and are com pensated fairly for their contributions.
For-Profit AI should not be allowed to be trained on sources from  the free internet. The free internet is for nonprofit use, and any AI
trained on free resources should itself be nonprofit as well.
