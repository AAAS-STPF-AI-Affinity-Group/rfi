AI steals from the livelihoods of Americans and profits off of theft. People do not want it. People are purposely
leaving Google as a search engine because of forced AI, using older versions of windows or switching to Mac, or atthe very least disabling it as much as possible. Please stop this madness. It's overhyped, and the only people whothink it's intelligent are those too undereducated for their current positions. While it does have a place, that place isin hyper-specific applications like detecting potential cancer before humans notice changes, not with languagelearning models that don't actually learn language and don't understand real meaning, and simply regurgitate stolenmaterial. I genuinely hope if you do this the random dice roll causes it to regurgitate Disney fan art based input andOpenAI gets sued by said corporation. Whether it's a major company or an individual creator, this is a plagiarismmachine writ large that you are giving permission to plagiarize to. Are you prepared to throw all copyright lawwhatsoever out the window? Can we get that in writing, that no copyright will exist anymore, for anyone, at all, everagain? No? Then don't do this.
Sincerely, Victoria Heather Kerr Meixell
