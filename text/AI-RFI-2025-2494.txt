General Comment
AI should not be excluded from  any form  of copyright in it's sourcing of training m aterial. Its inclusion in various form s of production,
design, and art in general only serves to hurt an already extrem ely com petitive m arket. Hiring engineers, designers, and artists to create
m aterial for AI to train off of could open m ore job opportunities for citizens nationwide. Allowing them  to bypass copyright however
would m iss this opportunity, and instead allow com panies to steal the work of artists and cut out those roles entirely. This could m ean less
jobs, a worse overall econom y, and a far lower standard of products across the board through over-reliance on the AI already evident in
advertisem ent and various form s of m edia.
