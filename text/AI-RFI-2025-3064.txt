General Comment
I believe that no AI com pany should be free from  the consequences of copyright infringem ent. Generative AI doesn't progress for the
better not will it better hum anity.
I believe if a com pany wants to run their m odel off of scanning art and studying art they should be required to license it. Or buy it outright.
Otherwise all we would be allowing is a legal form  of theft, both in craft and intellectual property.
Defend hum anity, defend our artists, defend our ability to create. 
Hold openAI accountable for what they have been doing. Stealing.
