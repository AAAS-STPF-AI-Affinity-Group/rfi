General Comment
This plan to destroy personal protections will cause devastation to republicans and dem ocrats alike, and will hinder private sector
technology developm ent as these AI com panies will have to endlessly litigate with foreign countries and com panies as their indiscrim inate
scraping policy steals creative work from  international sources. This is a com pletely backwards plan that will m ake AI developm ent in the
US grind to a stop.
Generative AI is already at a very useful point without having to risk constant legal battle and m assive loss of capital. There is no reward
for rem oving regulations.
