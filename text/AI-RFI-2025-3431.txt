General Comment
Allowing Ai to steal works from  m illions of artist m ay seem  beneficial but then it'll create a problem  that'll be too hard too control in the
future. That problem  is m isinform ation as Ai will generate im ages that are entirely fake and having a m illion and m ore of these im ages will
cause future generations to believe in false and m ade up im ages.
An exam ple is typing "Baby peacock" into a im age search like Google and m any of im ages would be ai generated that depict a fake im age
of a baby peacock, causing them  to think this is how baby peacocks look in real life. 
As for 2d and graphic arts. It'll cause m illions like m e, A budding and hard working artist to lose their entire lively hood. Years of passion,
work, and talent wasted. AI could m ake these "Arts" but since it doesn't understand em otion and lacks of direction of what a com pany
envisions for the art they want to advertise, it'll generate m ultiple im ages that have the basic idea but never have the exact em otion and idea
that graphic and m any other artist could create for com panies and society.
