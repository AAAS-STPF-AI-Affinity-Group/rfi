General Comment
AI has been doing the opposite of advancem ent. Thanks to AI m y job opportunities have dried up, internet search is useless,
m isinform ation is everywhere, and it is a danger as long as it rem ains unm onitored and unregulated. I do not think AI should have access
to work and inform ation without consent.
It's already violating hipaa. People have used it to create deep fakes. And it wastes energy just to m ake up lies. It has also been a giant
waste of m oney with no tangible results.
Lim it and regulate AI. Do not give it m ore access to inform ation.
