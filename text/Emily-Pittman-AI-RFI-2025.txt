As someone who is an artist who has been in the gig since 2019 and 2020 for digital art, AI does not have a place for
the future of The United States of America. AI is extremely damaging for artists as it would violate their copyrightwithout consent, and it should not be classed as fair use as a machine is actively copying from artists who put theirblood, sweat and tears into making something beautiful and actually has life in it. And you want to know what elseis gross about AI? It also uses up a lot of energy. Having ChatGPT make an email for you is the same as dumping anentire bottle of water out, or powering 14 light bulbs at the same time for an hour. Google’s Greenhouse Gasemissions had been increasing by 48% in the last 5 years because of AI hype.
It’s way too overhyped for the public as people have been scammed by a product that doesn’t actually exist, because
of scums using AI to get their attention. Remember what happened in Glasgow, Scotland last year?
Don’t support AI, and instead, focus on the actual artists who deserve it more.________________________________All e-mails to and from this account are for NITRD official use only and subject to certain disclosure requirements.
