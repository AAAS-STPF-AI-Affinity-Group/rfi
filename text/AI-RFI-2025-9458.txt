General Comment
Using copyrighted m aterial to train large language m odel AI is not a fair use of that m aterial. AI developers are seeking to profit off their
AI and therefore should not be able to use copyrighted m aterial in that developm ent without com pensating the holders of those copyrights.
Copyright law should apply to AI developers just like it does to everyone else.
