General Comment
AI has no place in the future, it is literally run off of stealing copyrighted m aterials. If copyright protections are rem oved in favor of AI then
the US governm ent is fully adm itting that AI is useless unless it steals. That m eans being okay with stealing the m oney out of the pockets of
US citizens, which is absolutely abhorrent.
