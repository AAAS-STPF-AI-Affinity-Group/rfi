AI is incapable of creating anything new. It can only generate things that itâ€™s been trained on.
This is why it is crucial that AI datasets do not contain copyrighted material that has not beenproperly licensed. It is stealing, plain and simple. If the technology is not viable withoutstealing data, then it does not deserve to exist.
