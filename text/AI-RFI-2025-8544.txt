General Comment
Generative AI uses large language m odels (LLMs) that cannot get any m ore sophisticated than they currently are. These m odels need to
be continuously fed new data to in order to learn m ore. Having already exhausted available data sets (com prising in part stolen
copyrighted creative works) the only m ethod available is to use other LLMs to generate new data and feed this into the LLM. This
process causes continual deterioration of the intelligence of the system  until it is only able to output nonsense.
Investing as a nation in these technologies is a huge risk in the short-term  and financial catastrophe in the long-term .
