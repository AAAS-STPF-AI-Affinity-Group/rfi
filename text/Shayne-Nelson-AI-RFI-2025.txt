The US Government should do the following: 1. Invest in Quantum computing. This is the next 
step in speed and machine learning, graduating from the standard 0/1 computer language to an 
expanded set of unlimited resources for computers 2. Invest equally in Quantum security. 
Companies such as Sealsqcorp (LAES) have pivoted semi conductor manufacturing to creating 
security solutions for Quantum computing 3. Standardize LLM instruction guidelines to limit the 
ability for machine learning to exceed human constra ints. 4. Invest in US AI startups, provide 
funds to smaller companies to engineer lower cost increased security applications 5. Enforce 
standard release QA processes across the industry to reduce critical and zero day vulnerabilities. 
Breaches occur becaus e of the lack of attention to detail. The highest most evident attack vector 
to AI is through vulnerabilities, or security holes not found in initial QA. This is because many 
small, medium and enterprise companies do not enforce release management and vuln erability 
patching cycles that will reduce the overall risk of unauthorized access to active source code, 
footholds in AI networks and the compromise of sensitive data 6. Require the security 
enforcement of LLMs and the type of information that is fed to a nd stored in LLMs to prevent 
the compromise of sensitive information.
