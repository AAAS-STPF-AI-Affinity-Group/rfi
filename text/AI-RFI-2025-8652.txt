General Comment
Ai is not at all tool that will benefit the Am erican people nor will it enhance any part of our lives. Ai only steals and causes even further
disparity between the rich and poor. Ai is unreliable in every context as it does not have accuracy close to that of a hum an. Cooking,
Medical work, The arts, ai is incapable of safely or ethically com pleting any tasks required for these fields and m any others. It is unstable,
unreliable, and it dam ages the world around us. Not just with the harm  it causes the environm ent, but the m isinform ation it can spread as
well. Ai will only take opportunities from  real hum ans and do a worse job while causing even m ore problem s. This is dangerous and puts
m any people at risk while also robbing them  of their livelihood and devaluing the hard work that the Am erican people put into their fields.
Nothing about Ai is helpful and it would be not only a disservice to us citizens but it would be a disastrous m istake that m ay take decades
to clean up and we would be the ones suffering because of it.
