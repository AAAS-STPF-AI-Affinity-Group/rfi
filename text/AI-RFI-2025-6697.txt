General Comment
AI com panies being allowed to legally steal from  whatever and whoever they want without repercussions is the opposite of what free
enterprise stands for. This will be protecting m achines over people, program s over Am erican citizens. Not only that, but it will cause so,
so m any people to lose their jobs as tim e goes on.
If you care about us, about *the people*, at all, do NOT allow us to be replaced and stolen from  by these com panies.
