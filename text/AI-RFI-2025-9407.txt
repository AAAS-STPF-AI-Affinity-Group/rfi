General Comment
AI com panies cannot deliver on their false prom ises, and so they are trying to destroy the right of creators to control what happens with
their own work. This will not help anyone in the US besides the CEOs of AI com panies. It will hurt m any people, both the creators who it
would now be legal to steal from , and the people who are subjected to the continued deluge of AI slop. AI com panies do not actually
have any ideas for how to im prove their m odels. They just donâ€™t want to face any consequences for the stealing they have done.
