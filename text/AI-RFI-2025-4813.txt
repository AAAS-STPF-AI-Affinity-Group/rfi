General Comment
AI art steals from  artists who have put in the work perfecting their craft to profit and m ake a lesser product. AI art does not have a place
in society, and allowing it to steal resources from  real hum ans would be a detrim ent to all. AI has already stolen and replicated so m any
works and m istreated so m any, we should not let this continue. AI art should autom ate the bad parts of life so that we can focus on
creating art, not create cheap m eaningless art and leave us to continue doing the grueling work. 
Please do not let AI steal the works of real hum an artists any longer.
