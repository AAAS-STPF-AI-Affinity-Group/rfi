General Comment
Do NOT accept this plan to prioritize the developm ent of AI. Big tech does not represent the interests of the Am erican people, and this
technology is extrem ely controversial am ong Am ercian creatives and other workers. This AI tech is built off of violating the ownership of
the peoples' own work, and furthering the interests of the AI industry is harm ful to all of us. Pursuing AI leadership is a threat to our own
hum an prosperity, a threat to our own econom ic com petitiveness, and a threat to our own national security.
The Am erican people do not want this country to be a leader in AI developm ent. We want this country to stop developing AI and focus
on real problem s, such as the price of rent and other costs of living.
