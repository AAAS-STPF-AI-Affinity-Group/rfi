Policy Recommendations for the National AI Action Plan  
Andrew DeBerry  
Executive Summary 
The United States has the opportunity to lead in the world in the strategic and business use of 
Artificial Intelligence (AI). This submission presents recommendations for promoting 
transparent governance, improving national security through innovative defense acquisition, 
fostering ethical AI applications in finance and faith communities, ensuring the explainability of AI model outputs, preparing an AI-ready workforce, honoring family- centered AI design , and 
enhancing privacy protections,. These strategies address historical regulatory and operational 
challenges experienced I have experienced while at Meta, Stanford, Microsoft , US Cyber 
Command, my Silico n Valley secure AI start -up, my wealth management firm, and Joint Special 
Operations Command (JSOC).  These proposals leverage cross-sector collaborations and emphasize transparency and accountability. By embracing these recommendations, this AI 
Action Plan can secure America’s global leadership in AI.  
Governance & Collaborative AI Development 
Transparent governance involving industry, academia, and policymakers is essential to prevent 
antagonistic regulatory relationships between the government and tech companies like Google, 
which have hindered innovation and America’s global AI leadership. Structured dialogues 
between industry and regulators can proactively address conflicts and facilitate productive 
collaboration.

academic, civil society, and government representation to create a comprehensive, inclusive framework ensuring AI developments align with broad societal interests. These councils should 
have clear mandates to address set transparent standards, emerging ethical dilemmas, and ensure 
balanced representation of stakeholder interests, thus avoiding domination by any single interest 
group. 
Policy recommendation 2: Institutionalize structured, recurring dialogues between regulators 
and industry leaders to proactively resolve conflicts, facilitate collaborative regulation 
development, and avoid reactive regulatory enforcement. This approach would prevent repeating the regulatory friction historically observed at companies like Meta, which slowed down 
innovation, business value, and American leadership. 
Policy recommendation 3: Substantially increase federal funding for independent academic and 
think tank research that objectively assesses the economic, societal, values -based, and global 
implications of AI. These insights will inform evidence -based policy and contribute significantly 
to balanced regulatory environments and sustainable AI strategies.
