Do not. It is as sim ple as that.
This use of artificial intelligence generation has zero future in this country. ZERO. Any attem pts to establish otherwise will be m et with
either colossal failure or the com plete collapse of the copyright system . Beyond that, it is ASTOUNDING that THIS is what you have
chosen to waste tim e, attention and m oney on. Out of all the current issues you have nom inated to approach in this failing joke of a
country, this was it. What a disgrace to this nation.
