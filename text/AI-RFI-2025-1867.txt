General Comment
As an artist within the United States, I find any proposal to allow Generative AI training to use copyrighted data without perm ission
appalling. Com panies behind these program s cannot be allowed to freely train on the data of those they have m arketed them selves as a
replacem ent for, under any circum stances. 
Copyright is enshrined within our constitution, and is vital to protecting the individuals who create said copyrighted works, allowing them
to guard their identity and to seek a profit from  their own labor. 
To allow com panies training generative AI program s to disregard this, especially in light that said com panies have repeatedly stated their
intent to m arket their program s as a replacem ent for hum an creativity and ingenuity, is nothing m ore than pandering to greed, and a tacit
endorsem ent of profits over people. OpenAI, Google, and other com panies cham pioning the unregulated developm ent of Generative AI
claim  they cannot train their data sets without free access to thousands of years of creative works, and yet say that hum an input is no
longer im portant to producing art, m usic, and literature. The United States m ust respect the rights of its citizens and regulate the Generative
AI industry accordingly.
