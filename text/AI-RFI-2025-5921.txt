General Comment
I believe that If the United States were to go with this Action Plan, then I believe that there should be used for the m edical field and to help
predict things like hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, and other things of that nature. I wholeheartedly believe that Ai SHOULD NOT be
used for the production of Entertainm ent such as Video Gam es, Television shows, Movies, and all other form s of entertainm ent. I also
believe that there should be copyright protections that prevent com panies to be able to use other people's property without consent or
proper paym ent. I also believe that it would be very dangerous for us to use Ai for certain things like in our Nuclear Arsenal because
alm ost everybody has seen Term inator or heard about it, also, it would be dangerous to im plem ent it in the news and m aking things that
we've already seen on Social Media with m isleading posts and im ages created with AI and the bots on X and other platform s with the
only com m and being to spread m isinform ation. Lastly, I believe that using fossil fuels, coal, or any other non-renewable energy is the
stupidest thing we could ever do and should opt for Nuclear Energy
