General Comment
Ai, generative AI, and LLMs do nothing for the world and am erica, or anyone for that m atter. They are sim ply tools to steal other's works
and destroy creativity and thought by m ixing other's things into a slurry of sim ilar im ages and language. At best it's used to m ake im ages
and text that can be used to trick people, at worst it does trick people and cause harm  through scam m ers, con artists, and anyone holding
any form  of artistic license or copyright. Generative AI in any form  is a net negative for everyone and should not be supported in any way,
shape, or form .
