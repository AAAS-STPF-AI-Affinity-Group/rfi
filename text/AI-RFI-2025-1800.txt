General Comment
Progress in Artificial Intelligence m ust not com e at the expense of copyright law. Allowing AI to scrape any and all content will create a
plagiarism  m achine, built on unpaid labor and unable to produce original work, regardless of the com m ands it is given. Major tech
com panies are already starting to step back from  AI as the public realized it doesnâ€™t live up to the hype, frequently delivers low quality or
outright wrong output, and wastes resources. Changing laws to allow a still unproven technology to grow is the wrong m ove.
