AI is only as intelligent as what is fed into its "brain" and the information that is stored for its 
access. Please be extremely careful that Leftist political doctrine is NOT made available to AI. It 
must be taught what is GOOD and what is EVIL. There is no better source for what is good and 
what is evil than the Holy Bible. The Founders of our nation used it to write the constitution and 
form our government. We were established as a Christian nation and that has not changed, no 
matter what certain preside nts may have declared. Communist, Socialist, Marxist ideologies have 
NO part in our nation, and AI must be "taught" those ideologies are unacceptable. Someone's 
"morality" is going to be programmed into AI. It needs to be God's morality, as found in the Te n 
Commandments and throughout the Holy Bible. Just as English has been an unwritten Official 
Language of the USA, so is the Christian Faith the unwritten Faith of the USA. Great care must 
be taken to not allow AI to be improperly "taught" but to have Bibli cal values.
