General Comment
Letting com panies train AI on copyrighted m aterials is im m oral and will lead to the loss of livelihood for m any Am ericans, likely m yself
included. As som eone who works in tech, I can personally confirm  that there is little to no concern for how AI will im pact hum anity, only
profits. It is dangerous from  m ultiple standpoints: environm ental, m oral, m aterial. Please do not let the unchecked greed of AI com panies
fleece hardworking creatives out of work!
