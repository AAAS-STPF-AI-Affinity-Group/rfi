From: Chaz Perera, Co -Founder & CEO at Roots Automation , and Ratish Dalvi, Head of AI 
at Roots Automation.  
As a leading insurance AI innovator, Roots Automation is proud to conduct our business

Government’s initiatives to strengthen America’s position as the global leader in Ar tificial 
Intelligence innovation.   
We urge this body to consider the following actions and principles for making American AI 
innovation stronger and more competitive.  
Comments:

Support open-source AI to accelerate innovatio n of new products and services from 
researchers, startups, and developers . 
•Avoid banning or overregulating open -source AI, which could inhibit competition
and progress.
•Support investment in smaller, smarter open -source models that offer efficient
and safe alternatives to large, closed models.
Balancing Innovation and Regulation to Increase Competition in the Closed-
Source AI  Market  
•Strengthen oversight of closed -source AI to  foster competition and innovation .
•Advocate independent testing of high -risk AI models to build trust and
confidence in AI by demonstrating that it is being developed and deployed
responsibly and ethically .
Prioritizing S afety in the Development of Superintelligent AI  
•Create strict safety guidelines to ensure  future superintelligent AI aligns with
human values.


•Expand collaboration  with other countries to  prevent the misuse of
superintelligent AI for harmful purposes.
Protecting Copyrighted and Private Data  
•Strengthen laws to prevent AI from using copyrighted materials or personal data
without permission.
•Require transparency about the data used when training AI.
•Simplify opt -out processes for  individuals and content creators  to control how AI
systems use their data.
Fostering Competition in AI among Companies of all Sizes  
•Promote decentralized AI systems, such as shared networks and open research
collaborations.
•Support policies that allow smaller companies and independent developers to
compete in AI without dependency on Big Tech.
Preparing for AI ’s Impact on America’s Labor Force  
•Incentivize investment to create smooth transitions and assistance to workers
displaced from traditional roles by AI automation.
•Support safety nets to help those affected by AI -driven automati on.
