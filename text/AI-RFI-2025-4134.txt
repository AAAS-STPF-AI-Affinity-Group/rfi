General Comment
"AI" is a speculative m arket in the veine of cryptocurrency and NFTs, with huge legal problem s; OpenAI and other com panies are
currently em broiled in lawsuits from  newspapers and publishers. "AI" runs on wholesale copyright infringem ent, and even OpenAI's CEO
adm its that without copyright infringem ent, his product is dead in the water. Setting ALL of this aside, "AI" is environm entally disastrous
and built on underpaid, "invisible" labor, in addition to sim ply not working. It doesn't even work! It's fleecing the Am erican public and has
no place in federal policy or developm ent.
