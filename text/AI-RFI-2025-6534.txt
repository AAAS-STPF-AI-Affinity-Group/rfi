General Comment
AI is an overhyped technology, specifically one hyped intentionally to create a speculative bubble. It is a wasteful and purposeless
technology that is fleecing the investor class and stealing from  everyone who uses the internet in any form . It is a technology designed for
wide-scale industrial and intellectual theft, breaches of NDAs, breaches of privacy, and copyright infringem ent.
It has no future in the United States or elsewhere, as those who invest the m ost in it will also be its suckers, the victim s of a bigger fools
scam , when the rug is pulled out from  under them . This technology has no long-term  benefits for hum anity, technology, science, or culture.
It is a poisonous vacuum , a black hole into which m any people seem  content to toss very large sum s of m oney on the back of irrational
prom ises for which there is sim ply no m aterial evidence.
It is a waste of tim e & m oney. It is, essentially, a scam  perpetrated by a few Silicon Valley elites, which has heretofore successfully taken
in countless gullible rubes whose fear of m issing out has led to catastrophic dam ageâ€”financial, legal, and otherwise.
