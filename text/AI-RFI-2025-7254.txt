General Comment
This plan is a determ inant for the creative pursuits to everyone who wishes to create. AI has no place in the hum anities we practice. There
is no beauty in an algorithm , and corporations only desire to use OpenAI to rem ove artist and writers from  creative endeavors in our
m edia. I em ploy you all to not allow the use of copyrighted m aterial for greedy business to rob from  creative m em bers from  our society.
This executive order is actively trying to break copyright laws that has been established in the last years of precedence. To ensure the
growth of creative arts in Am erica, the copyright laws of m edia, art, and m usic needs to be protected.
