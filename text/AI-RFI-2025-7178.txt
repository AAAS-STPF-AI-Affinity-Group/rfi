General Comment
The field of "Artifical Intelligence" as it has com e to be known in the last couple of years is a com plete m isnom er. It is not in any way
intelligent. It is unable to analyze or com prehend any of the data it's given in any m eaningful way and can only produce predictive output
based on patterns of likelihood, the result of which is factually wrong alarm ingly often. This technology is a com plete dead end research
wise that serves alm ost no useful purpose except in highly specific m edical applications. The vast bulk of its use in the current m arket is
m erely to underm ine and devalue the working creatives of the world via theft and plagiarism , always resulting in an inferior product that the
public by and large recognizes as such and rejects com m ercially. No am ount of lifting restrictions on use of copyrighted content for these
algorithm s to train on will m ake them  anything m ore than slightly less error-prone pattern regurgitators, which will never serve a practical
purpose that other, m ore specialized, less resource-dem anding technologies don't already do better. I im plore you not to grant any special
perm issions on developing this wasteful, pointless, intelligence-insulting field.
