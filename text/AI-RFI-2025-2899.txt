General Comment
It can't be overstated what a terrible idea this is. There are iterations of "AI" - a term  that gets thrown around way too often and is used to
indicate m ultiple very different things - that serve a purpose. Pattern recognition for tum or form ation, for exam ple. In contrast, LLMs are
useless garbage that create nothing but useless garbage. You propose to underm ine entire industries dependent on IP protections so that a
handful of com panies can m ass-produce ugly, pointless, unappealing schlock that dem onstrably doesn't have an audience. Ask Microsoft
how their launch of Copilot went. Ask them  how popular it is. (It's not). People don't like or want this tech: it doesn't have a use. Don't
destroy what vestiges of the econom y still work who are - again, please pay attention to this im portant detail - creating a product no one
wants.
