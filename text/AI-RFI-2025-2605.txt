General Comment
Generative AI is theft, pure and sim ple. It steals not only from  artists and authors, destroying their livelihoods, but from  com panies as well.
Product designs for com panies will be fair gam e if this happens.
From  the poorest to the richest, we are all vulnerable to having our creativity and incom e taken without recourse. 
And for what? Products that spit out half truths and lies? AI doesn’t understand or reason. It tells people to drink bleach. It m akes up
facts. It’s a glorified collage m ade of scraps of people’s works. 
GenAI needs to be strictly regulated, not let loose to destroy lives and livelihoods.
