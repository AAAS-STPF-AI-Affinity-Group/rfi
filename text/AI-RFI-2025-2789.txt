General Comment
AI without regulations would spell disaster, not only for artists but also for fact-checking, m edia literacy and truth. AI needs to be
regulated and checked to halt the harm ful spread of m isinform ation as well as protect the livelihoods of artists and creators. AI is a
soulless tool, nothing m ore. It shouldn't be used to replace talented trained artists, nor determ ine what "truths" the public knows.
