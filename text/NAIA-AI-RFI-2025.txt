Our Comments  
Our comm ents  were developed with our leadership and members by our General Counsel, 
Steve Britt , Managing Partner of Britt Law LLC  (  (www.brittlawllc.com ), 
who  holds the AIGP, CIPP/Europe  and CIPM  certiﬁcations for artiﬁcial intelligence  & data 
privacy . 
A. O ur Key Prioritie s
We applaud the Trump Administration for conducting an analysis of the complex regulation 
of cyber, data  privacy & AI (collectively, “ data management ”) with the REQUEST FOR 
INFORMATION ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACTION PLAN (the “ RFI”).  
The RFI represents a unique opportunity to reset the laws & regulations applicable to every 
organization’s  use of data , whether in the government or the private sector .  Our comments 
are based on the following  priorities :  
1.Support the Trump Administration’s goal of ensuring US global dominance of  all
forms of technology development , including AI ,
2.Enhance the security of all US assets and operations,


3.Stimulate innovation & investment in technology development by eliminating
conﬂicting laws that burden companies with unnecessary compliance costs,
4.Simplify data privacy rules through  adoption of a CLEAR ( CERTIFIED LABEL FOR
ELECTRONIC AGREEMENT RIGHTS) Label that implements privacy by d esign  principles ,
5.Make AI development transparent through principles that empower consumers to
manage their own risks,
6.Codify Federal law that p reempts all state laws & regulations relat ing to data
management,
7.Stimulate “all the above” energy production , including development of modular
nuclear energy  & advancement of lower energy consum ing quantum computing,
8.Protect our youth from the adverse  mental  health effects of social media platforms
and addictive designs of phones, apps, software, tools & games,
9.Make the US Government the most efficient on earth, powered by AI and
10. Ensure Open -Source Intelligence remains open for all companies large & small.

F.Appendix: Form CLEAR Label


C. Current Leg al Landscape
We begin with a review of the data management laws  that have passed since 2022.  We 
believe this landscape explains  the need for action and why the RFI is so timely.  
a.GDPR . All data protection roads begin here.  Effective in 2018, GDPR automatically
applies to all 27 EU member states  and t he collection of data by both proﬁt &
nonproﬁt organizations , both online and offline.  It applies to the collection of EU
data by any  organization located anywhere in the world , including online .
GDPR  taught us about data subject rights (right to know, correct, limit, opt -out,
access & delete) that are now included in every US data privacy law.
Article 25 of the GDPR (“ privacy by design”) required the implement ation, by
default,  of designs that are the most protective of data privacy.  This requirement
was not included in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“ CCPA”) nor any state
data privacy law since .  If privacy by design  had been included in US data privacy
laws, it would have simpliﬁed and clariﬁed the data regulation  path we have been
traveling.  We believe it should be part of a new regime going forward.
b.EU AI Act.  The EU AI Act  applies to general purpose AI (“GPAI”) models and to “high
risk” AI models  that are introduced into the EU or used by Europeans .  It governs the
following levels of risk to users’ fundamental rights:  (i) “prohibited” uses ” (e.g.,
deceptive techniques, social scoring, predictive policing, real time b iometric I.D. by
law enforcement and scraping images for facial recognition databases) , (ii) “high
risk” uses involving critical infrastructure, access to education, employment ,
public -private beneﬁts  and democratic processes , and (iii) “low or minimal risks ,” 
which are systems that generate images, audio -video or text .
Providers of high -risk and GPAI systems with systemic risk must (i) implement and
document  a responsible AI risk management system , (ii) train and continuously test
the system with  valid  high -quality data,  (iii) validate the system before release and
throughout its lifecycle as being “ accurate ,” “robust,” “transparent ,” “secure,” 
“unbiased ” and “accountable ,” (iv) document how the algorithms work , (v) perform
an EU AI Act compliance assessment before release , and  (vi) register the system in
an EU-wide database .  Fines for v iolations of the Act can reach €15,000,000 or 3% of
worldwide revenue, whichever is hig her.
c.State Artiﬁcial Intelligence Laws .  In the absence of a Federal AI law, states are
enacting their own AI laws. The ﬁrst movers are Colorado, Utah, Texas & California :
Colorado Artiﬁcial Intelligence Act
Colorado’s AI Act  takes effect on Feb ruary 1, 2026 and mirrors the EU AI Act.  It
requires developers of high -risk AI systems to prevent algorithmic discrimination


based on a person’s  age, color, disability, gender,  race, religion or veteran status.  
High -risk AI systems are those that make or substantially contribute to the making 
of a “ consequential decision ,” which is any decision that affects access to or the 
price of education, employment, ﬁnancial services, government services, 
healthcare, housing  or insurance.  
Colorado AI  Developers must  document the proper and foreseeable harmful uses of 
the AI system,  explain the type and lineage of system training data, r eport on the 
logic of the algorithms , explain risk mitigation measures, publish a statement that 
details how the system was developed and how it manages known or foreseeable 
risks, and promptly report instances of algorithmic discrimination  to the A.G . 
Utah Artiﬁcial Intelligence Act  
Utah ‘s artiﬁcial intelligence law took effect on May 1, 2024  and primarily covers 
generative AI , which it subjects to Utah’s consumer protection laws .  A person using 
generative AI in a business regulated by the Utah Division of Consumer Protection 
must disclose, if asked, that the user is interfacing with a machine .  A person 
providing the services of a licensed occupation  must affirmatively inform  
consumers they are interacting with AI. 
California AI Acts a nd Cyber, Risk & ADMT Regulations  
In 2024, California pass ed several AI laws, including the following: 
(i)AI Training Data Transparency Act: Effective Jan uary  1, 2026, developers of
generative AI models must publicly post on their web  site information about
the training data used in their system s, including  the sources of the data, the
types of data points, any applicable IP rights to the data, whether the
datasets contain personal information and any modiﬁcations to the model.
(ii)(SB 942) California AI Transparency Act:  Also on January  1, 2026, generative
AI systems that produce audio -video content with  1,000,000 or more
monthly users  must  make an AI detection tool publicly and freely available to
users that reveals the system’s creation or alteration of content.
(iii)(AB 1008) Amendments to CCPA:  CCPA was amended to cover personal
information in AI models, giving data  rights to AI data, tokens  and weights.
In addition, t he California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA ”) is proposing the 
following r egulations for activities posing a signiﬁcant risk to consumer privacy : 
•Cybersecurity Audits
Every business processing data that poses a signiﬁcant risk to consumer s must  


complete a n annual  cybersecurity audit of key security controls performed by a 
qualiﬁed independent professional that is reported to the BOD or CEO .  
•Risk Assessments
Every business whose processing of data poses a signiﬁcant risk to privacy must 
also conduct a risk assessment. “ Signiﬁcant risk to privacy ” means (i) selling or 
sharing personal information, (ii) processing sensitive information, (iii) using 
automated decision -making technology (“ADMT”) for signiﬁcant decision s or for 
extensive proﬁling, or (iv) using personal information to train ADMT or an AI system.   
The assessment must weigh the risks of data processing activities against their 
beneﬁts  with risk mitigation actions . It must explain the quality of the data, the logic 
of the algorithms and the use of system outputs.   An abridged version of the 
assessment must be submitted to the CPPA.  
•ADMT Regulations
A business that uses ADMT for “ signiﬁcant decisions” about a consumer regarding 
ﬁnancial services, housing, insurance, education, employment, compensation, healthcare or for extensive proﬁling must comply with new ADMT regulations.  Consumers must be provided a “ Pre -Use Notice” of the purpose of the ADMT , the 
consumer’s right to opt out of such use , how the ADMT works, its logic, its intended 
outputs and how the business will use those outputs.   Consumers have a right to 
appeal an automated decision to a qualiﬁed human reviewer  with the power to 
overturn the decision .  
d.State Data Privacy Laws .
In the 7 years since GDPR, we have no Federal data privacy law but 23 state data
privacy and “consumer health data ” laws .  While independent and complex, t hese
laws actually share many similar terms .
For example, with rare exception, they all require covered businesses to (i) fully
disclose all categories of personal information collected, (ii) provide broad datasubject rights, (iii) restrict the collection and use of sensitive data, (iv) control the
transfer of data for targeted advertising and proﬁling, (v) require reasonable datasecurity, and (vi) require broad data protection assessments  that must be available
to regulators on request.
Nevertheless, these similarities are overtaken by a wide  range  of conﬂicting or
inconsistent terms .
For example, (i) some state laws apply to non -proﬁt organizations while most do not,
(ii)some require prior opt -in to the collection and use of sensitive information while
others require a right of opt -out to such activities, (iii) some regulate online a ctivities


impacting the mental health of minors and others do not, (iv) the age of minority 
varies by state, (v) the response deadlines for data access requests vary, (vi) some states mandate automatic notice to regulators for denials of a deletion request while oth ers do not, (vii) the CCPA applies to employees and B2B contacts whereas 
all other states exclude those categories of users, (viii) some states require prior 
notice and a right to cure for violations of the act while others have no right to cure, (ix)all states require disclosure of the “categories” of personal information collectedwhile only California provides a list of categories, and (x) Washington State requiresa separate consumer health data privacy notice under the Washington My HealthMy Data Act (“ WMHMDA”).
Perhaps the starkest difference in state data privacy laws are the jurisdictional 
triggers for applicability based on the number of records of the state’s residents 
collected each year, as summarized below : 
States 
Annual # of residents from 
whom personal data is 
collected 
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, 
Utah, Minnesota, New Jersey, Iowa, Oregon, Indiana, Kentucky   100,000  
Rhode Island, Maryland, New Hampshire, Delaware  35,000  
Tennessee  175,000  
Montana  50,000  
Texas, Nebraska  One (1) resident  
Florida  $1B in revenue  
Texas is the next data privacy law expected to pass in the form of the Texas 
Responsible AI Governance Act (HB 1709) (TRAIGA) .  Introduced in December 
2024, TRAIGA would regulate the use of “high -risk” AI systems that make or 
substantially contribute to “ consequential decisions” (same as the Colorado AI 
Act).   Developers must use reasonable care to avoid algorithmic discrimination and 
conduct annual risk reviews .  They must disclose the (i) purpose of the system, (ii) 
the nature of consequential decisions made by the system, (iii) the factors used in 
consequential decisions, and (iv) the identity of the deployer.  


Almost all state data privacy laws preclude a private cause of action for violations of 
the laws.  The notable exception is Washington’s My Heath My Data Act.  With no direct path to sue, the plaintiff’s bar has sought  out alternatives , resulting in a series 
of class actions ﬁled under state consumer protection, wiretapping , the Video 
Privacy Protection Act, common law privacy and California Invasion of Privacy Act.    
Turning to AI, no AI Act changes traditional product  liability, strict liability and 
negligence (tort) laws for  damages resulting from the use of AI.  Given the 
complexity of AI compliance, AI development is deﬁnitely facing substantial 
litigation risks . 
e.American Privacy Rights Ac
t of 2024 (“APRA”) .  The APRA  (HR 8818) was
introduced on June 25, 2024.  After t wo full committee markups  failed, the bill died
upon expiration of the 118th Congress.  Many elements of ARPA were  quite
reasonable .  For example, it applied to:
(i)Businesses governed by the FTC, including certain nonproﬁts , and exempted
small businesses with <$40,000,000 in a nnual revenue ,
(ii)Large data holders  with over $250,000,000 in annual revenue or which
collected data on more than 5,000,000 individuals ,
(iii)It included b road deﬁnitions of personal information  and sensitive data and
granted broad data subject rights ,
(iv)Targeted advertising was  limited to (i) the speciﬁc purpose  of the data
collection or (ii) express user consent,
(v)On the 2 key issues, APRA preempted state data privacy laws but the
exceptions to preemption  were many , including consumer protection,
employee & student privacy, civil rights, data breach, banking &
wiretapping laws , and
(vi) ARPA did authorize a private cause of action for actual damages,
attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief  effective 6 months after passage.
D.[NAIA’s Propos ed] American Data Management & AI Act ( “ADMAIA”)
The RFI offers a unique opportunity to reduce the barriers to innovation and sound 
regulation resulting from the random roll out of data privacy and AI laws .  All businesses run 
on data  and the current landscape creates a “Catch 22” for businesses trying to comply 
with these laws .  Advertising and marketing technologies are ground zero for these issues 
and, while those are key  industries, a new law could unlock the conﬂict  in these regimes 
from user data rights.   


With these goals in mind, NAIA recommend s that the Trump Administration propose to 
Congress and support enactment of a comprehensive data management & AI bill  named 
the “ American Data Management & Artiﬁcial Intelligence Act ,” or “ADMAIA” ).  Key 
elements of ADMAIA are set forth below:    
a.One Comprehen sive Bill.  We need a comprehensive solution so ADMAIA  would (i)
memorialize the data rights of consumers  that have reached consensus among EU
and state laws, (ii) standardize  the consent rules for sensitive data , targeted
advertising & proﬁling, (iii) incorporate privacy by design that enables adoption of a
data privacy nutrition label, (iv) preempt all state laws in all related data
management and AI areas, including consumer protection, wiretapping  and state
privacy laws, (v) incorpora te responsible AI development principles in a rational
manner  with self -certiﬁcation for standards that are not yet established, (v i)
standardize all data protection and AI risk assessments, (vi i) shield US technology
ﬁrms from regulatory overreach, and (vi ii) provide a sound liability regime that
protects victims of AI discrimination while  protecting innovation  with appropriate
enforcement mechanisms but with  no private cause of action .
b. Data Privacy  Regulatio n.
(i)Incorporat e privacy by design  into all commercial technology development,
(ii)Implement a CLEAR P rivacy Label  (Certiﬁed Label for Electronic Agreement
Rights) for a standardized disclosure of data privacy & AI practices  with
exceptions based solely on consent  & the original collection purpose,
(iii)Establish by default that individuals own and control their personal data
unless they voluntarily share, grant or consent to alternative  uses,
(iv)Require a uniform set of d ata rights (right to know, correct, limit, opt -out,
access & delete) and eliminate anomalies,
(v)Eliminate record collection tests for applicability of the law and limit a gross
revenue test to a small business exemption ,
(vi)Ban online use of dark patterns (i.e., the use of an interface that subverts or
impairs user auto nomy or choice),
(vii) Preempt  all state data privacy laws & regulations  as applied to data
use, including consumer protection, invasion of privacy, employee privacy,
consumer health data, wiretapping, video protection and similar laws ,
(viii) Preserve exemptions at the entity level for businesses regulated by
HIPAA, GLBA, FERPA, FCRA, FCC  & FTC  but eliminate overlaps where data is
regulated by both Federal law and state data privacy laws ,


(ix)Apply to nonproﬁt organizations subject to deﬁned safe harbors,
(x)Provide small business exemptions from burdensome requirements ,
(xi)Merge requirements for data protection  and AI risk assessments under
regulator -approved forms , and
(xii) Adopt a common data security audit framework.
c.Artiﬁcial Intelligence Regulation.
(i)Prioritize transparency in AI development over assessments  performed
before product completion ,
(ii)Establish responsible AI development principles for Federal government
acquisition and use of AI technologies ,
(iii)Promote the development of AL/ML by (A) forming  a national computation
reserve/resource for small business & research institut ions, (B) incentivize
the sale of data to  the Federal government for open -source AI/ML training,
and (C) establish favorable data rights clauses for AI/ML developed with
government -provided compute or data resources,
(iv)Ensure secure  export controls on international distribution of AI technologies
and remote  access to AI technologies,
(v)Expand access to Free and Open- Source Software (FOSS)  under permissive
licenses and Responsible AI Licenses (RAIL), limiting application of copyleft
licenses  to AI models ,
(vi)Promote use of synthetic training data and informed human-in -the -loop for
overly burdensome safety, transparency and nondiscrimination standards,
(vii) Require use of valid training and test data and require ongoing
monitoring and validation of AI models throughout their life cycle ,
(viii) Codify that data minimization does not prevent the use of LLMs, that
training data may be retained for extended periods and that databases may
be reused if data was collected lawfully and reuse is compatible with the
original collection purpose,
(ix)Merge AI risk & compliance assessments with data protection assessment s,
(x)Require disclosure of all generative AI uses with appropriate contentalteration and watermarking requirements,


(xi)Impose trustworthy AI standards of security, resilience, transparency,
explainability, lack of bias and human centricity, and
(xii) Require validation of IP rights, developer’s right to model inputs &
outputs and any use of public AI development platforms .
d.Enforcement .
(i)Permit audits & investigations by state attorneys general and regulatorsenforcing Federal ( i.e.,  ADMAIA) standards, ﬁnes & penalties,
(ii)No private cause of action for violations of ADMAIA  but any claims authorized
should be limited to  (i) recovery of actual damages, with (ii) no right to
special or punitive damages, and (iii)  subject to a 60-day right to cure before
an action can be ﬁled,  and
(iii)Protect EU -US Data Privacy Framework  (“DPF”) for transfers of EU personal
data to the US by ﬁlling vacancies on the Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight
Board (“PCLOB ”), (2) protecting CJEU adequacy decision  for the DPF,  and (3)
supporting FTC and DOJ enforcement of FISA Section 702 , and
(iv)Pursue a joint US -EU regulatory regime similar to DPF to harmoniz e data
management enforcement by US & EU regulators  for ADMAIA, GDPR, Data
Act, Data Services Act & Data Markets Act.
e.Children’s Privacy Rights .
(i)Require informed parental consent for online services th at collect, use or
disclose the personal information of children under age 18  with detailed
disclosure obligations to parents  as a condition to their consent,
(ii)Expand deﬁnition of children’s personal information to include biometric
identiﬁers (ﬁngerprints, retina, voiceprints, etc.)  and GPS location data,
(iii)Impose strict limits on sharing of children’s data for targeted advertising ,
(iv)Require social media companies to employ design features that prevent
addictive behavior like time limits and restrictions on addictive features,  and
(v)Increase ﬁnes and penalties for noncompliance .
f.Energy .
AI requires stable, consistent, non-breaking power. Nuclear is the only reliable
source and NAIA encourages the Administration to fund pilots of nuclear -


powered data centers and streamline licensing to deliver safe  nuclear  energy to 
meet AI’s rapidly rising electricity demands.  
E.NAIA’s Recommendations
The National Artiﬁcial Intelligence Association strongly supports the Trump 
Administration's vision of American global leadership in AI technology development. We 
advocate for policies that maintain competitive advantages, strengthen R&D ecosystems, foster talent development, and secure critical technologies. Strategic investments in 
emerging AI capabilities must be coupled with removing innovation barriers to ensure th at 
the US remains the unrivaled world leader in artiﬁcial intelligence development and deployment.  
NAIA’s proposed legislation, ADMAIA, seeks to level the regulatory playing ﬁeld for US 
businesses in order to enable efficient and effective compliance.  We believe that passage 
of a broad new Federal data privacy & AI law will restore the US as a global leader of sound and innovative technology development . 
In addition, enhanced security of US assets and operations requires a comprehensive 
approach integrating AI -driven threat detection and response capabilities across critical 
infrastructure. We recommend robust cybersecurity frameworks embracing zero -trust 
architecture, increas ed public-private intelligence sharing, and protection of intellectual 
property. Advanced AI systems can proactively identify vulnerabilities, detect anomalies in real -time, and automate incident response, creating a security posture that safeguards 
America's technological and economic interests. 
Innovation requires freedom from excessive regulation. We advocate eliminating conﬂicting laws that create compliance burdens, particularly those imposing duplicative requirements across agencies and jurisdictions. A streamlined regulatory approach will reduce compliance costs, allowing companies to redirect resources toward 
groundbreaking research and development. This regulatory rationalization will accelerate AI advancement while maintaining appropriate guardrails through performance -based 
standards rather than prescriptive requirements.  
The CLEAR Label framework outlined in ADMAIA and shown in the attached Appendix 
would transform data privacy by implementing " privacy by design " principles through a 
standardized, consumer -friendly labeling system. This approach would communicate data 
practices transparently while simplifying compliance across jurisdictions. CLEAR Labels 
would indicate precisely what information is collected, how  it's used, and consumer 
control options —similar to nutrition labels— enabling informed consent without 
burdensome paperwork. This balanced approach protects consumers while enabling 
innovation.  
Transparency in AI development requires empowering consumers to understand and manage their own risk tolerance. We advocate for clear disclosures about AI capabilities 


and limitations, opt -in mechanisms for sensitive applications, and tools that allow 
individuals to customize AI interactions according to their preferences. This consumer -
centered approach maintains innovation momentum while building public trust 
through education and meaningful control options.  
Federal preemption of state data management laws is essential to eliminate the current patchwork of conﬂicting regulations. A uniﬁed national framework would provide consistent protection while reducing compliance complexity and costs. This approach would establish clear national standards for data collection, processing, security, and 
consumer rights, creating certainty for businesses while ensuring that all Americans 
receive an equal  and effective level of  data protections regardless of geographic locat ion.  
America's AI leadership depends on next -generation computing infrastructure. We 
advocate accelerating development of an “all -the -above” energy production policy with 
speciﬁc focus on modular nuclear reactors to provide clean, reliable energy for data 
centers and quantum computing facilities. Strategic investments in energy efficient data centers and quantum technologies will unlock computational capabilities essential for advanced AI applications with less energy consumption . This dual -track development 
approach ensures America maintains both the energy capacity and processing power necessary for next -generation AI systems.  
Protecting youth mental health requires balanced policies addressing harmful design elements in digital platforms. We support research -driven standards that prevent 
exploitative patterns in apps, games, and social media without stiﬂing innovation. This includes promoting transparency about engagement metrics, limiting certain addictive 
features for minors, and developing age -appropriate design codes. These protections 
should be developed in partnership with industry to ensure effectiveness and practicality . 
Transforming government efficiency through AI requires strategic implementation of 
automation, predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-support systems across federal 
agencies. We advocate a coordinated approach to digitize processes, eliminat e 
redundancies, and enhanc e service delivery. This would reduce operati ng costs, improve 
user experience, and enable data -driven policymaking.  
Finally, Open -Source Intelligence must remain accessible to businesses of all sizes. 
Policies should e nsur e that foundational AI research, datasets, and basic algorithms 
remain broadly available while protecting proprietary inventions . This will prevent 
monopolization of critical AI building blocks, foster competiti on, and help small 
business es participate in AI advancement. Democratized access to core AI strengthens 
America n innovation.       
Thank you for the opportunity to submit these Comments.  We look forward to discussing these issu es further.         
Sincerely, NAIA
