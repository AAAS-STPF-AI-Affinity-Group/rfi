General Comment
NO. Absolutely not. I oppose this in the strongest possible term s. So-called "artificial intelligence" is just plagiarism  software. Do you
intend to just ignore copyright laws? To violate the basic concept of intellectual property? To steal anyone's work that has ever been put
on the internet? NO. This is wrong, this whole scam  of a business m odel and process of inform ation tech is WRONG!
