General Comment
A com plete disregard of all copyright for AI that cannot think is an awful idea. To steal from  hardworking writers, artists, hum an beings-
for lifeless im itation that anyone could m old to whatever good or evil they desire regardless of intent, is a m oral failing on all fronts. 
You should be asham ed of yourselves.
