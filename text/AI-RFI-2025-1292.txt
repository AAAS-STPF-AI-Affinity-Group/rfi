General Comment
"Prevent unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents from  hindering private sector innovation." This seem s to be im plying that the regulations
that protect everyday Am ericans from  being taken advantage of by the, m ega corporation, private sector are in the way of unregulated AI
use. This can only be at the expense of the Am erican public.
As an artist who shares their work online, I absolutely reject the AI Action Plan. This will do harm  to so m any sm all businesses and
creators, who relay on our ability to post our work to online platform s. This includes, but is not lim ited to, Artist, Writers, Program m ers,
YouTube Creators, Publishers, ect. Requirem ents such as copyright, help protect our work from  being stolen and used without our
consent. Allowing the private sector though the use of AI, to steal and use our work without consent is highly unethical and is harm ful our
livelihoods. The private sector (or even the public sector) should not be allowed to use our work without perm ission and proper
com pensation. This will not "prom ote hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness" it will only fill the pockets of rich investors, while
starving the working class and the poor.
