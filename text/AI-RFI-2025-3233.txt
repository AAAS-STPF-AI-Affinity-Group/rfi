General Comment
Am erica should under NO circum stances aim  to be a global leader in artificial intelligence. It is a scourge on our planet, artists, and writers
everywhere. Artificial intelligence MUST pay artists and writers to train their m odels on their owned, copy written and pictorial works that
are not public dom ain. To do anything less is an absolutely abhorrent and unethical business practice.
