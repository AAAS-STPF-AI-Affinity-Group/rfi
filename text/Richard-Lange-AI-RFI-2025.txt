Stronger AI systems will come not from scaling up existing tech but from foundational science 
and new innovations. Supporting researchers doing this innovative work is critical. Academics 
especially rely on government grants and recruiting international students to do their work. 
Invest in AI by removing barriers to grant funding and student visas, or at the very least not 
erecting new barriers to these.
