General Comment
Good Morning!
Happy at the opportunity to com m ent on this subject. My biggest worries for AI stem  from  access to weaponry and replacem ent of
hum ans in the work econom y. AI m ust never have access to the nuclear arsenals of our country or others. AI is m arketed as an addition
to the hum an workforce and to m ake our lives easier. It is very clear that AI will take m any jobs regardless of what the Silicon Valley
startups claim  to their investors. Even if AI autom ates away the "m undane" tasks of m any com panies or organizations, those m undane
tasks currently put food on the table for people across the country. Without serious leading by our policy m akers on creating job
opportunities in step with the ram pant developm ent of AI, m any people will be left behind. I do see how AI can benefit us in m any ways
due to its quick com putation and flexibility am ongst varying tasks. But AI is a technology sim ilar to CRISPR in that a serious divide
between the haves and have nots in society could widen. It should be treated as a tool and not a Saviour. AI does not have a soul like we
as hum ans do and should not been seen as m ore than it is. 
Thank you for your tim e! Goodluck.
