General Comment
I am  concerned about how rapidly deploying AI could harm  the intellectual property rights of artists whose work is used to train AI. I'd
rather the governm ent prioritize com pensating such artists with royalties first instead of rushing to deploy AI by effectively stealing from
working artists.
