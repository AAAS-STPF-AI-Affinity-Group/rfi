General Comment
To whom  it m ay concern, I believe that Open Source LLMs, lim ited AI applications and Research & Developm ent in Reasoning
Intelligent Agents should proceed in an intelligent and equal oportunity m anner to all developers and science thinkers for the com m on good
no m atter their countries origins or political affiliations.
The United States and, in fact, the whole world will greatly benefit from  the wise application of this proposed Artificial Intelligence Action
Plan.
