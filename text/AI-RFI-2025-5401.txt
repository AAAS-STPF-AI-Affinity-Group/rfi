General Comment
AI is a business dead-en d that is already failing, only a fool who wants bankruptcy invests in this kind of snake-oi l &^%i t. You 
need creati ve humans, there’s literally no way arou nd that no matter how much you wish otherw ise — all you’ll do by proceedi ng 
with this clownery is to dri ve creati ves elsew here an d make th e US dependen t upon importing the creati ve conten t it can no longer 
produce itself. You’re going to kneecap a *multi-billion-dol lar industry * becau se some nerds are mad that they can’t create their 
way out of a paper bag  and resen t the peopl e who can. This lunacy is straight-up killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, and 
you’re all too f&^% stupid to realize it. Great f&^% job, super geniuses.
