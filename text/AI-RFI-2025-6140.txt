General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI steals
from  individuals as well as larger com panies. We as individuals should not be heavily reliant on artificial intelligence to be able to form  our
thoughts. AI should be lim ited and not relied on in this way. AI should help and not take, steal, and control the population of the US. This
plan is unecessary and I believe it will break regulations and copyright issues. I understand that AI can be used in a m ultitude of ways,
however, we as a society and organization should not use this technology in this m anner.
