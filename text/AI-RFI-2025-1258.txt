Subject : RFI on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  
To Whom It May Concern:  
IAPP appreciates the opportunity to respond to the National Science Foundation’s 
(NSF) and Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) request for information on the development of an AI Action Plan  for the U.S. Administration .

IAPP is a global policy neutral non -profit organization with a mission to define, 
promote and improve the professions of privacy, AI governance, and digital responsibility. Since our founding in 2000, our membership has grown to include over 87,000 individual professionals across 158 countries. Over these 25 years, 
professionals have signed up for more than 125,000 training s and qualified for over 
91,000 certifications.  
AI governance profession als are essential to long -term AI growth . 
IAPP’s policy neutral posture is rooted in a simple idea: no matter how legal rules, norms, and principles evolve , a community of capable and connected professionals is 
necessary to meet the challenges and  growth opportunities where data, technology, 
and human  interests intersect. Measuring and managing tech risks and benefits 
means staying up to date on evolving standards for privacy, cybersecurity law, and 
the interdisciplinary field of AI governance.  
Regardless of the underlying AI policy objective, IAPP believes professionalization is a precondition to lasting and successful innovation, which requires a right -sized 
understanding of risk.
2 A workforce of qualified professionals who understand the 
interplay of AI benefits and risks is necessary to foster  better business outcomes 
tailored for long -term leadership . 
Recognizing the urgent need for AI governance professionals to build the trust in AI systems necessary to scale AI adoption  across the economy, IAPP launched our AI 
Governance Center in 2023.
3 Soon thereafter, the AI Governance Professional (AIGP) 
certification entered the market as the first credential of its kind. Since then, individuals and organizations have signed up for 12,000 AIGP trainings  with a current 
total of  2,370 AIGP -certifi ed professionals .  
This strong demand highlights the need within organizations to benchmark and build 
processes that keep up with the breakneck pace of AI standards and best practices. 
Like all IAPP certifications, the AIGP is designed to reflect the state of the art for the 
field, as defined by current industry practices, leading voluntary  federal  government

system accountability measures and policies (June 12, 2023) Docket No.

initiatives like the influential  NIST AI Risk M anagement Framework, and emerging 
regulatory requirements  in the U nited States  and around the world.  
Consumer trust is good business.  
Consumer trust can make or break new technologies. Public confidence in emerging 
tech takes years to build, but only a single harmful incident to crumble . In a 
groundbreaking survey -based report on privacy and consumer trust, IAPP found that 
over 80% of individuals said they are likely to stop doing business with companies that have been the victim of a cyberattack.
4 
Trust fuels market participation and fosters economic growth. For example, in the privacy domain, the  spread of standards for transparency and control over personal 
data were driven by the convergence of consumer mistrust and competitively differentiated privacy practices, not just by government interventions.
5 More than 
any other factor, it was the spread of  qualified professionals  across organizations —
the professionalization of the practice of privacy— that built  trust in the marketplace, 
enabling business growth while right -sizing risk.  
AI systems are no different. As they proliferate, managing the public perception of risks and benefits is necessary for adoption to fuel the virtuous cycle of innovation.  
Innovation flourishes with consistent standards of responsibility.  
Professionalization also leads to  uniform benchmarks for evaluating risks and 
assigning responsibility across firms. A shared understanding of these matters across 
a connected community of professionals  reduce s uncertainty, streamline s global 
compliance, and levels the competitive playing field.  
Indeed, the lack of capable AI governance professionals presents a  major  barrier to the 
adoption of AI technologies across organizations , where surveys consistently show a 
lack of adoption of AI systems due to the persistence of skills gaps and an 
overestimation of risk .
6 Another consistent barrier to AI adoption is the business friction 
created by a lack of clarity of where responsibility should lie for AI outcomes —with the 
developers who train systems, or with the users who deploy them.7 Even if not solved 
by top -down rules, these frictions will be  mitigated  by shared professional practices.  
A competitive workforce requires knowledge of risk management.  
Less than a decade ago , the field of data privacy sat in a similar nascent position, where 
expert navigation was needed to build consistency and trust into organizational

pract ice. Working together, a global community emerged to build the training, 
certific ation, and knowledge -sharing opportunities that led to the development of 
mature and interdisciplinary privacy functions within organizations today.8 
IAPP believes that the ongoing work to spread AI governance practices across 
organizations will benefit from professionalization in the same way, centered within a 
workforce that is trained, credentialed , and connected to keep pace with increasing 
complexity and risk. The substantial gap between the demand for experts to 
implement tailored AI  governance  practices and the professionals who are ready to do 
so represents a significant barrier to AI innovation and competitiveness.  
Luckily, a multi- faceted community of AI governance stakeholders is already 
emerging, from teams within developers and deployers to vendors, assurance 
toolsets, and research and standards setting organizations in the public and private sector.
9 
In short, no matter which tools you pursue in the Administration’s AI Action Plan, please keep in mind the people who will do the work.  
To achieve a n efficient and  long -lasting  AI ecosystem, the U nited States  must 
prioritize the professionalization of the AI  governance  workforce. This approach 
guarantees that risk -aware innovation can flourish, benefitting consumers, 
businesses, and the U.S.  competitive standing on the global stage.  
We thank OSTP, NSF, and the Administration for considering these comments.
