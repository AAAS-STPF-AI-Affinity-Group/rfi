General Comment
I'm  an Am erican citizen. I don't think there is any future for artificial intelligence in Am erica. Am ericans are intelligent enough on their own.
We are not going to m ake Am erica great again by depriving people of every chance to em ploy critical thinking skills and replacing that
with m achines that will spit out cobbled together nonsense based on algorithm ic input com piled from  data that has been stolen anyway.
Am ericans are sharp, sm art, creative, innovative problem -solvers. They are law-abiding and respectful. We don't need m achines to m ake
us lazy, and we don't need m achines that can only learn by thieving legally protected copyright m aterials to do it, either. Make people use
their own m inds and do their own work. Delving into artificial intelligence is a waste of tim e and m oney.
