AI is does not have a place in the future of the United States in its current state. AI actively
steals from my livelihood as a creator making it harder each day to achieve an Americandream, as companies actively steal from my work as well as those of others and creates uselessgarbage that no one in the public cares about. It is a fleeting fad that so far has served notangible benefit and in fact profits off larceny. These companies are in violation of copyright.They threaten my business. They do not deserve immunity but to be shut down to allowpeople to continue to make their livings in creative fields without constant fear of mass theft.
 
End this now.
