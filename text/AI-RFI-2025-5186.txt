General Comment
In the last few years AI has been used by m ega-corporations with little regard to am erican copyright law, training on copyrighted works of
com pany's and authors alike.
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican artist and profits off of theft
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
As an am erican illustrator I have seen first hand what it has done to the entertainm ent industry and to its workers.
Please go against this, I and every illustrator does not want this, we are am erican workers who want no part of this AI change.
