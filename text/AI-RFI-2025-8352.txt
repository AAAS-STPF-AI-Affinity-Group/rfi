General Comment
It is absolutely crucial that this technology be annihilated and the ashes scattered to the winds. It will strangle Am erican industry - not just
entertainm ent and culture industries, but every corner of the econom y will be ultim ately be hurt if copyright theft is given any kind of legal
patina. Everything from  the digital sector to heavy industry depends on the strength of Am erican copyright law, and if it is broken we will
feel the negative consequences for generations. I beg you, for the future of this country, do not m ake it any easier for them  to stripm ine our
m ost valuable intellectual property.
