General Comment
AI is an im m ature technology; it would be foolish to waste governm ent resources on developing private-sector AI capabilities that don't
stand to benefit the Am erican people as a whole.
Any action plan should include reasonable safeguards - requiring AI generated im ages to be labelled, in som e way; requiring AI engines to
be able to be interrogated as to how they have generated certain outputs so they can be checked and refined; and im portantly, respecting
the copyrights of Am erican writers and artists. Generative AI should only be trained on public dom ain or legitim ately licensed works,
requiring artist or author perm ission for the latter.
Until we have safeguards like these, the Am erican public at large will continue to be largely indifferent or hostile to AI generated products,
ensuring that the com m ercial failure we have seen so far will continue.
That trust factor is essential.
