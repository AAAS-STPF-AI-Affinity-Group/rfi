General Comment
OpenAI and other so called AI com panies cannot be allowed to just steal the creative endeavors of working Artist, Writers, Musicians to
just create cheaper knock off. They will continue to just steal it.
If they are to use others content then they should provide com pensation to the copyright holders in the sam e way that TV royalties and
others.
