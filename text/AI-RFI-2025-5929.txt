General Comment
"AI" is not artificial intelligence, it's a worse version of autocom plete built off of thievery and copyright infringem ent. It uses a ridiculous
am ount of energy and water, uses up space, and uses up m oney for worse product that will never truly stand up to any hum an creation;
including a one year old's finger paintings. Why should we waste m oney protecting these greedy corporations from  copyright infringem ent
charges instead of fixing the econom y, or protecting veterans, or for cancer research? The only people that support this "AI" nonsense are
idiotic, greedy, or both.
