General Comment
Do not allow intellectual property to be abused and stolen by AI com panies. This hurts sm all businesses, suppresses creativity,
disincentivizes innovation, and threatens m assive legal conflicts over where intellectual property ends and publicly available m aterial begins.
This m atter should already be clear, and if AI com panies cannot com pete in a free m arket without breaking existing law, the law should
NOT BE CHANGED to accom m odate them .
