General Comment
AI is deeply harm ful to m any creative industries, and produces inaccurate, useless nonsense at it’s current state of developm ent. It benefits
no one, besides a few techbro shareholders of AI com panies, wastes m assive am ounts of energy, and has yet to be im plem ented in any
m eaningful way to productive workflows. I honestly don’t think you care about what the average creative has to say about it, but m ajor
com panies such as Disney and Sony who are notoriously protective of their IPs likely will not enjoy their protections being stripped and
their content stolen to prop up a few failing AI com panies. If the technology was any good, it wouldn’t need to steal so m uch copyrighted
content to produce results.
