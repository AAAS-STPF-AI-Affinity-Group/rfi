General Comment
This proposal is very shortsighted and will negatively effect the US.
This threatens the livelihood of m any Am ericans. It also infringes on the work of hardworking Am ericans via theft.
AI is also a very unregulated m arket that is rife with scam  and charlatan behavior. This will serve to underm ine m any Am ericans rather
than help.
