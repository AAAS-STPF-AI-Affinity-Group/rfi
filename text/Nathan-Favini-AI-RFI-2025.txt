Subject: AI Action Plan 
Dear Mr. D’Souza: 
We appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the development of an Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan as outlined in the Federal Register notice (90 FR 9088) 
and pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order issued on January 23, 2025. 
Background 
Pair Team is a public beneﬁt corporation and AI-native digital health startup 
specializing in value-based care management for high-need, high-c ost populations in 
Medicaid and Medicare. With decades of experience in technology and healthcare, we 
identify, engage, and manage individuals whose complex needs drive signiﬁcant 
healthcare utilization. Leveraging AI, we pinpoint patients who would beneﬁt most 
from intervention and empower care teams to address both medical and social drivers 
of health—ultimately delivering improved health outcomes and substantial cost 
savings for payers. 
Our data demonstrates signiﬁcant improvements in chronic disease management and 
mental health: 
●Diabetes control: The percentage of patients with poorly controlled diabetes
drops from 63% at enrollment to 30% within six months.
●Blood pressure control: Controlled blood pressure rates improve from 50% at
enrollment to 67% post-enrollment.
●Depression remission: 57% of patients with depression experience remission
within six months.
Additionally, our program generates meaningful cost savings for both Medicare and 
Medicaid programs: 


●Up to $25,000 in annual savings per dual-eligible (Medicare/Medicaid
bene ﬁciary.
●Up to $15,000 in annual savings per Medicaid-only bene ﬁciary.
●52% reduction in emergency department visits.
●26% reduction in inpatient admissions.
Opportunity 
The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) estimates that AI could generate 
$200–$360 billion in annual healthcare savings. The potential for AI to enhance 
cost-eﬀectiveness in Medicare and Medicaid far surpasses any prior technological 
advancement. AI-driven solutions can streamline administrative functions, enhance 
patient engagement, and improve fraud detection—positioning AI as a crucial tool for 
cost reduction and system eﬃciency. 
However, Medicare and Medicaid’s ability to leverage AI has been hampered by 
outdated administrative systems, limited integration with emerging technologies and 
risk aversion on the part of payers across the system. As healthcare and social services 
evolve to meet complex needs, the urgency to incorporate AI and generative AI 
(GenAI) into Medicare and Medicaid has never been greater. These technologies oﬀer 
a transformative opportunity to address non-medical health needs, improve service 
delivery, and expand access to care for communities across the country. 
While AI’s potential is vast, its implementation must be thoughtful, responsible, and 
community-centered. Yet, the risks of inaction are even greater. Modernizing 
Medicare and Medicaid through AI is imperative to closing care gaps and improving 
health outcomes. Below, we oﬀer concrete recommendations for integrating AI and 
GenAI into these programs at scale. 
Recommendations 
1. Prioritize AI Deployment in Medicare & Medicaid
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) should launch a Request for Innovations, inviting 
industry proposals on AI-driven solutions for Medicare and Medicaid. This initiative 
would catalyze innovation, surface impactful technologies, build market trust and 
drive eﬃciencies in administrative, clinical, and operational work ﬂows. CMS should 
also establish a dedicated AI Accelerator Program to support pilot programs, fund 
promising AI applications, and scale solutions that demonstrate measurable 
improvements in cost and quality outcomes. 
2. Encourage State-Level AI Implementation
CMS should issue a State Medicaid Directors Letter (SMDL) encouraging states to 
explore AI applications for various Medicaid use cases. Establishing AI Innovation Labs 
at the state level—through public-private partnerships—would help test AI-driven 
2 


interventions, measure eﬀectiveness, and scale best practices nationwide. 
could focus on key areas such as the development of AI-enabled medical groups, 
predictive analytics for high-risk patients, automating administrative processes, and 
improving population health management. Additionally, CMS should provide grant 
funding and technical assistance to states willing to invest in AI-driven transformation 
eﬀorts. 
3. Foster a Measured Regulatory Approach
While it is essential to establish frameworks for ethical AI deployment, excessive 
regulation could stiﬂe innovation. HHS should adopt a measured regulatory approach, 
ensuring AI solutions are safe without imposing barriers that dela y meaningful 
advancements. For instance, FDA could issue clear guidance stating that 
patient-facing applications of AI for care coordination, including for health-related 
social needs, are not software as a medical device.  A Regulatory Sandbox could be 
established to allow developers to test AI-driven healthcare solutions in a controlled 
environment, ensuring that oversight mechanisms evolve alongside technological 
advancements. Furthermore, CMS should provide clear guidance on AI governance, 
including best practices for bias mitigation, data security, and patient privac y 
protections. 
Conclusion 
AI and GenAI represent an unprecedented opportunity to modernize Medicare and 
Medicaid, improve patient and provider experiences, and build a more eﬃcient, 
eﬀective healthcare system. By acting decisively, the White House and HHS can create 
the necessary incentives and structures to drive this transformation—positioning 
both Medicare and Medicaid as leaders in healthcare innovation rather than laggards. 
We appreciate your consideration of these recommendations and welcome the 
opportunity to collaborate on advancing AI-driven solutions for Medicare and 
Medicaid.
