General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to evade copyright infringem ent and be im m une to lawsuits would be beyond irresponsible, and m ostly likely result
in m illions in the entertainm ent industry losing work and entire com panies going bankrupt. We cannot allow this, please do not allow this. I
do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. All it does is steal from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft of
intellectual property. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. It's nothing but a stupid fad that people are aim ing to
use as a tool to avoid paying workers who have fam ilies to feed and bills to pay.
