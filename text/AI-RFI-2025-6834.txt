General Comment
AI should've been m ade to do boring m enial tasks no hum an should have to do, and yet, AI is here doing all the things hum ans m ust do to
be hum an- our art.
AI hurts every single Am erican who wishes for a future. The environm ental costs, along with the ethical ones, cannot be overlooked. 
It is im perative our leadership realizes the direct harm  that will be caused by allowing free rein to any AI corporation. Not just to regular
Am ericans, but also to them  in regards to how it has no barriers to not train off classified inform ation. It is an intelligence nightm are to
allow AI to be this close to governm ent offices.
