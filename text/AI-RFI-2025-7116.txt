General Comment
OpenAI’s entire business m odel is built on theft from  artists, intellectuals, and basically anyone who has ever m ade or written anything. It’s
trash. Altm an is trash, and these com panies should not be allowed to steal work for m om entary gain, especially when THEY are charging
people to use their plagiarism  m achines. Please do not allow this to m ove forward because it is im m oral and illegal. If som eone stole
Tesla’s IP or proprietary info from  Goldm an Sach’s people would be charged. The am ount of m oney the artist or writer has should not
m ean they also don’t get protection from  theft of their work. Billionaires are not a protected class. They’re barely even hum an so m aybe
rethink this nonsense.
