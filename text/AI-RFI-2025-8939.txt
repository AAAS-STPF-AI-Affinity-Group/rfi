General Comment
As an artist whose visual work is online in m ultiple locations, I am  appalled that we are considering giving AI developers unlim ited
perm ission to “scrape” the internet for visual, literary, and aural content for learning m odels. Hum an creators are bound by copyright laws;
“fair use” is strictly lim ited unless a work is in the public dom ain. Why should AI com panies not be bound by the sam e laws? Allowing
these com panies to feed on artists’ work—which m ay be the culm ination of years of study, experim entation, and labor—without
rem uneration is theft.
