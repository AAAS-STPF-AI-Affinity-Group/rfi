General Comment
I am  against any use of "artificial intelligence" as it stands in our present day ad it sim ply scrapes data from  m any people without discerning
the inform ation and form ulates a response based on an average of these things put together. It steals data from  others without even
knowing what their personal research was. That alone can create dangerous setbacks and problem s in the future if we rely on it. I am  also
gravely concerned with how m uch energy it takes for AI to form ulate their responses as well, energy that could have been used to power
fam ilies' hom es or other im portant buildings and functions. For these reasons I am  against this.
