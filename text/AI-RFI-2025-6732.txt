General Comment
I do not believe the further developm ent of AI holds the Am erican people's interest at heart. It steals from  hardworking people not for the
betterm ent of the Am erican people but rather its for cheating people out if their livelihood. It purely is profiting off of theft. And not only
does it steal, it provides security risks that people who know nothing about AI have no concept of. Letting the creators of AI products fun
freely to do whatever they will exclusively ruin this country. Contain this threat before its too late.
