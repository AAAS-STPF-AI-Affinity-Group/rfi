General Comment
This is an anonym ous agent that works with several com panies. I am  here to com m ent that they state that they will not recognize this
order. Any future effort to infringe on the intellectual property or copyright that they own will lead to future legal action. They believe this is
a gross m issuse and breach of the protections previously granted to them  by the US. 
Furtherm ore, there is an obvious and ethical com plication that arises from  this order. They believe that this order will be used for m alicious
m isinform ation and slander. This includes prom otion of fraudulent services or products, profiting off of intellectual property that one does
not own, m isrepresentation of products and services provided by others, and the ability to use the order as a "legal loophole" for crim inal
activity.
There is also ethical concerns involving the generation of child pornography. 
We are against this order, but we also warn that we will begin heavily prosecuting those that abuse this order. This is not lim ited to
individuals, but any group or organization that we find at fault. 
We im plore a m ore neutral agreem ent to be recognized, where rights-holders can agree to have their property used in the generation of
"AI" content. The rights-holders will be able to absolve the agreem ent with third parties if they find the content generated offensive or
against their agreem ent.
