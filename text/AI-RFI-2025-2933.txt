General Comment
I do not agree with these policies. We need to continue to provide protections against AI and its unbridled use. Allowing various
individuals and com panies to have no lim itations on what can be used will lead to the spread of greater m isinform ation and the destruction
of art. Nothing will be safe from  the prying eyes of corporations and everything will becom e up for grabs to be used and abused by higher
powers. The overuse of AI will also lead to the downgrade of intelligence. If we as hum ans m ust rely on a m achine to learn, then we
cannot possibly grow beyond where we are now.
