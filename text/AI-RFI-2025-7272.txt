General Comment
AI com panies use typical tech bro swagger to sell investors on their sleazy product and now it has to be everyone else’s problem . If there
is any belief whatsoever in intellectual property, these professional thieves cannot be allowed to continue.
In the likely event the United States shores the wrong thing anyway, it will be one m ore reason not to believe Am erican propaganda that
China isn’t doing significantly better than us. We are told constantly that China is evil because they don’t respect copyright law, but it turns
the governm ent’s only problem  with that was their ethnicity.
Leave AI to rot, or hasten your inevitable dem ise. Those are the options.
