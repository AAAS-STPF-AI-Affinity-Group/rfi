General Comment
AI does not hold a place in Am erica's future. AI steals from  Am ericans. AI m ust receive explicit opt-in perm ission from  creators before
using their work. AI m ust com pensate creators fairly for their work once agreem ent is m ade. Original creators of works used to train AI
m aintain ownership. AI cannot create anything and anything generated by AI exists solely in the public dom ain.
