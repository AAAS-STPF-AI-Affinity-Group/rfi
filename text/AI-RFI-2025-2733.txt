General Comment
Developing an AI that is trained off the data of m illions of Am ericans will be dangerous for this country and the country is overhyping and
fleecing the Am erican public with the potential developm ent of allowing these AI com panies to do this. AI steals off the livelihood of m any
and is a danger by profiting off of theft without any com pensation given at all to those who are affected.
