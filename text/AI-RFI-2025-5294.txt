General Comment
Generative Artificial Intelligence has no m aterial gain in term s of defense.
Generating text or im ages based on stolen m aterials does not have m ilitary benefit.
AI in this form  weakens copywrite law in the US and abroad, stealing data training sets is still stealing. As the US has utterly failed it's
m anufacturing industries the only rem aining exports it has are intellectual, rem oving that possible export guarantees econom ic collapse
when there is nothing left to sell.
Allowing com panies to use licensed m aterials for generation of tools m eans that as long as a com pany puts "AI" som ewhere in their term s
they would have the right to steal and use any software, im ages, videos, or text they want. 
Generative AI has alreqdy been shown to be disliked by consum ers. The recom m ended searches surrounding generative AI or "copilot"
features are asking how to disable them . Windows 11 is losing m arket value to Windows 10 in part due to AI features along with
Microsoft reducing the num ber of leases it had in place for servers capable of generative AI. Apple has also reduced it's goals for
generative AI after seeing m arket reaction.
Generative AI would drive up power costs in a country with an already pitiful power grid, take away opportunities from  businesses and
citizens alike, eventually crash the m arket for no gain, and has no m ilitary benefit.
