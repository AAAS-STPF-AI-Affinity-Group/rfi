Art is so important to me because it is one of the few ways I'm able to truly show my inner 
thoughts in physical form, AI art is made almost exclusively out of stolen art, stolen dreams, and stolen inner thoughts Human Art is the most important to me to see, all the imperfections, all the sketchy lines and asymmetry shows the artist behind it, AI art takes all of that away, it takes the passion and love and emotion and grinds it into algorithms and numbers Al art is not art There are many things I could say, but you cannot automate art like you can automate other tasks Art is not something that can be manufactured in a factory. Itâ€™s something that has to be handmade. Art is something that we humans have been doing for years since the time of the woolly mammoths roaming our earth we have been doing artwork, and drawing the creatures that we seen or how we feel about them, art now is the same as it was all those years ago art evolves with us it cannot evolve with AI without artists that AI is useless it will be come eventually a garbled mess feeding 
off of itself becoming worse, it needs to feed off of stolen artwork made by artist who are trying their hardest to express and show what they wanna show in the world. Al Art can never replace a human because art is a human thing
