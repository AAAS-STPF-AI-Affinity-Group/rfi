General Comment
I am  adam antly against the unlawful and illegal assistance proposed under the Executive Order. Artificial intelligence is no m ore the wave
of the future than the segway. It is a gim m ick to boost the stock of tech com panies who can offer nothing m ore than so-called genAI-
"created" content cobbled together from  the work of actual hum an beings—writers, artists, actors, m usicians, etc. Com panies such as
OpenAI and their leadership have stated that they cannot last unless given access to copyrighted m aterials. Good. If that's the case, then
they should die. Creative people are owed their due and they are owed respect and dignity for their engagem ent in the act of creating—
one of the m ost hum an instincts that we have. The cold inhum an m achine learning calculated regurgitations of "AI" can and will never
m atch that of hum anity. Spend this m oney on anything else. Medicine. Education. Supporting the arts (the HUMAN arts).
