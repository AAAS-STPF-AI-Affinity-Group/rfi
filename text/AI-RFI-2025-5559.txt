General Comment
We do not need theft for our com m unity in our future. AI has no place in our com m unity. It takes the livelihoods of artists, writers,
m usicians, and various other creators and profits from  THEIR work. This will im pact everyone if we do not put up guidelines to prevent
theft! There are m any ways AI can harm  our com m unity. Replicating people's voices, their appearance, falsifying inform ation, taking
som eone's im age and slandering it! This is just the tip of the iceberg! We do not need to use other people to enhance AI.
