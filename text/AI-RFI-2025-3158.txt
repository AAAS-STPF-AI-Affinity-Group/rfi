General Comment
Generative AI m odels, such as OpenAI, ChatGPT, Midjourney, FLUX.1, etc, should not be given free rein to utilize and work off of
copywritten m aterials without the copyright holder's consent, as it'd not only affect the artists and writers of the original sources, but it'd
also potentially affect the econom y as a whole.
I do not see AI holding a place in the future of the United States. AI not only steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican creator, but it'll
also profit from  the blatant theft it com m its. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
Do not give these generative AI com panies full perm ission to steal from  artists, both big and sm all.
