General Comment
Copyright, like tradem arks, has been an enshrined right of creators for centuries, since Albrecht Dürer first sued a copyist in 1511 over
the use of his artist’s m ark. If we as a country decide to allow one com pany, in this case OpenAI, to ignore the legal rights of creators to
enforce their copyright then it will depress the econom y by m aking creatives of all kinds decide to leave the country in order to protect
their rights. This m eans m ajor m usic labels, m ovie studios, publishing com panies, fashion labels, etc, and the effects will be large scale loss
of jobs and the decline of Am erican soft power. There cannot be any exceptions m ade so that a com pany m ay ignore copyright. If that
com pany cannot survive or produce a product without violating copyright it doesn’t deserve to exist. It’s not a viable com pany if breaking
the law is its business m odel. A business like that is no better than organized crim e.
