General Comment
Part of what m akes Am erica great is all the inventors, artists, writers, and m usicians that we have produced and benefitted from : both in
our world reputation and our econom y. For this reason, AI m ust not steal copyrighted work. It cheapens work m ade by m illions of
creative Am ericans and (I believe) will hurt us in the longterm .
