General Comment
The AI system s m ade by Big Tech com panies like OpenAI (Microsoft) and Google threaten to destroy thousands of Am erican sm all
businesses like m ine with their recent dem and to create special carve outs in copyright law.
AI can't innovate. It can only steal, m ash up and regurgitate what already exists. 
The adm inistration should focus on protecting creators content and not giving it to Big Tech com panies. 
These com panies should be required to get consent to use our work. And it should NOT be assum ed consent is given autom atically. Opt-
in, not opt-out. 
And transparency from  Big Tech should also be focused on. Require Big Tech to disclose what m aterial is used in their training and AI
content should be labeled as such. 
I love the idea of a program  that can use som e technology to help stream line hard working artists work. But that's not what this AI is. This
is theft of our work and of our skill on an unprecedented level. I've spent 18 years of m y life as a full tim e artist developing m y skill. We
should not sacrifice the hard work of hundreds of thousands of Am ericans like m e and give it to Big Tech by rewriting copyright law. 
Art is used in every product you see. Your box of cereal, the design of your shoes, the design of your car, the m ovie you watched,
everything. That's an unprecedented am ount of jobs that are threatened by AI theft.
Please do the right thing and protect hardworking Am ericans.
