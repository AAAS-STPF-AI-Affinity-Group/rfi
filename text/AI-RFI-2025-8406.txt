General Comment
This is legalizing theft and that is unacceptable. Open AI will steal, distort, warp and violate what creatives develop and ruin the ability for
any artist, writer, developer, studio or anyone who shares any form  of creative or intellectual work to use such skills and assets these
people have rightfully honed to m ake a living wage and sustain them selves and their loved ones. Open AI will use these people as fodder,
feeding a m achine that needs incredible am ounts of power that would better serve citizens and cities in need of such energy and can only
produce less than a percent of the potential Open AI claim s it can. This executive order will sim ply tell Open AI that they are allowed to
use the creative and intellectual ability of US citizens without our consent and without our benefit. It tells the citizens of the United States
that what we are able to produce is our governm ent's right to hand over to som eone else and that our opinion over what we m ake doesn't
m atter- that we have NO RIGHT TO WHAT WE MAKE. We are not free labor for com panies like Open AI to exploit. We are not
sim ply fodder for som eone else's m achine to chew up and discard without care for our ability to sustain a lively hood. DO NOT give
Open AI the ability to use us as slaves for som eone to take advantage of and inevitably ruin for som ething that will gain them  NOTHING.
DO NOT GIVE OPEN AI ANY LEGAL RIGHT TO STEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES OR ANYONE ELSE ON THIS
EARTH.
