General Comment
AI is an existential threat to thinking hum ans. Research has already shown that students who use AI lose other skills. This is terrible for
everyone. AI is a "solution" in search of a problem . It's just nonsense that tech com panies are trying to create interest in so they can sell it
to other com panies. It's trained on stolen data. It uses a vast am ount of energy to create inferior results. This is repugnant. If AI has to
exist at all it m ust be regulated.
