General Comment
AI should be used for applications such as big data processing and predictive generation of m edicines. Things the hum an m ind is not
capable of and urgent life saving research. Protect artists and writers from  their work being scraped without consent. Protect the privacy
and dignity of citizens from  exploitation. I believe we can use AI responsibly with peoper regulation but the risks are high. Thank you for
your consideration.
