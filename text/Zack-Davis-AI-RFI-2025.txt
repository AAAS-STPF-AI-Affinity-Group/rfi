RE: AI A ction Plan RFI
While the dev elopmen t of articial in telligence applications has and will con tin ue to unlo c k economic v alue, it's
critical that go v ernmen t decisionmak ers don't lose sigh t of the more far-reac hing implications. T o da y , AI is a useful
to ol for the automation of cognitiv e tasks, m uc h lik e an y other computer program. In that con text, far to o man y
concerns ab out "AI risk" from misinformation or misuse of existing systems are o v erblo wn. Nev ertheless, in the
limit of arbitrarily p o w erful AImac hines that can do ev erything h umans can do and morethere's a serious risk
of h umans losing con trol of our o wn creations.
Ho w ev er strange the idea migh t seem at rst, the argumen ts are so o v erwhelming that h undreds of qualied
exp ertsincluding, notably , T uring A w ard winners Georey Hin ton and Y osh ua Bengio and the CEOs of fron-
tier AI companies Demis Hassabis, Sam Altman, and Dario Amo deisigned a 2023 statemen t pro claiming that
"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should b e a global priorit y alongside other so cietal-scale risks suc h as
pandemics and n uclear w ar" (h ttps://www.safe.ai/w ork/statemen t-on-ai-risk).
It's hard to judge exactly when in the future tra jectory of AI dev elopmen t the truly existen tial threats will
emerge, and harder still to judge what the optimal p olicy resp onse should b e. (A theoretical argumen t ab out what
should happ en "the limit of arbitrarily p o w erful AI" do esn't sa y m uc h ab out ho w that limit is approac hed.) But
the stunning adv ances of deep learning o v er the last dozen y ears (and, notably , large language mo dels o v er the past
six) presen t clear evidence that it's not to o early to act in some w a y .
As a mere concerned citizen (a computer programmer b y profession, ha ving studied the issue as a priv ate individ-
ual), I'm not sure I ha v e the exp ertise to sa y exactly what ough t to b e done, but one ob vious suggestion is that the
U.S. AI Safet y Institute should b e w ell-funded and its recommendations tak en seriously . Also, mandatory rep orting
requiremen ts for fron tier AI training runs w ould pro vide critical visibilit y without unduly burdening inno v ation.
As P aul Christiano of the U.S. AISI p oin ts out (h ttps://www.alignmen tforum.org/p osts/Hw26MrLuhGWH7kBLm/ai-
alignmen t-is-distinct-from-its-near-term-applications), the tec hnical pro ject of guring out ho w to build secure AI
systems is distinct from the passing p olitical fads of the momen t. This is not a partisan issue. I am,
F aithfully y ours,
