General Comment
If there is no option but to m ove forward with endorsem ent of AI despite m ass public backlash against the tech, it is im perative that
restrictions and regulations are placed on it to protect individuals and businesses, especially when it com es to generative AI m odels.
Generative AI m odels need to have private databases that only contain data gained consensually, and users of YouTube, X, Instagram ,
Facebook and all other social m edia sites need to be notified in advance if their posts will be used to train AI m odels so they can easily
opt out via in app settings if they so choose. Failure to allow users to opt out, especially on a m ajor site such as X which had m any users
build up followings long before the site changed its nam e, should be m et with swift legal action as it can be considered both intellectual
property theft and unlawful invasion of privacy. This needs to be extended to protect businesses as well, as OpenAI and Googleâ€™s push
for copyrighted works to be fair gam e for their databases would be disastrous for the copyright system  as a whole and has the potential to
com pletely dem olish creative econom ies in the United States. Failure to recognize this will hurt our country far m ore than it will ever help it
and will restrict the freedom  of Am ericans to reliably pursue a career of their choosing, keeping m any from  being able to achieve the
Am erican dream .
