General Comment
I have two concerns:
1. Google currently has an "A.I." system  used in its default search results. This system  frequently returns incorrect and in som e cases
dangerous answers. Until the issues with these search results are resolved, I am  concerned about giving Google and OpenA.I. still m ore
access to m aterials.
2. Open A.I. plans to use creative work m ade by other people without com pensating the creators for their work. This is a blatant violation
of current U.S. Copyright law; this sort of infringem ent should not be allowed.
