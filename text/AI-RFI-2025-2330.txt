General Comment
Any exceptions in federal copyright law will only serve to underm ine Am erican interests, freedom s, creativity, and innovation. Such a
carve out in our laws would also create an opportunity for our rivals and enem ies to easily and freely farm  Am erican creations and ideas
by using tools m ade by big corporate interests who aren’t necessarily beholden to forwarding U.S. interests. We fundam entally cannot
trust these big tech com panies to have unlim ited access to such a m assive dataset without Am erican innovators and creators having a
direct say in how, where, and when their works should be used. While we are a country that praises bold ideas and a desire to innovate,
we are also one that’s taken consistently firm  lines against theft and exploitation of intellectual properties and freedom s. As such, big tech
and AI com panies should continue to be held to the standards of U.S. copyright laws, and denied special exceptions based on hype-filled
prom ises that lack a firm  vision of AI’s place in the Am erican econom y and m arketplace of ideas.
