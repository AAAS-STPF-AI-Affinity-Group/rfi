General Comment
As a journalist and public writer, m y creative output has m onetary value and shouldn’t be duplicated through AI algorithm s or anywhere
else without m y explicit consent. Putting public writing in the hands of AI program s underm ines confidence in the writing and has the
potential to underm ine m y ability to m ake a living — and the confidence in all public writing.
