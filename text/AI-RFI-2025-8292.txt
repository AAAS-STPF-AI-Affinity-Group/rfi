General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US--it's a ripoff m achine with extrem ely lim ited abilities. Allowing it to rip off the labor
of Am ericans with im punity is insane. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican writer and profits off of the theft. It's a scam  and the
governm ent has no reason to support this scam .
