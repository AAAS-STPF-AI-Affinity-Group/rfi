General Comment
Please do not allow stealing of copyrighted m aterial for AI program s. The purpose of copyright is to allow artists to m ake a living and
encourage them  to create, as well as later allowing other artists to develop new ideas out of the copyrighted work of other artists. Our
founders thought this was so im portant it was included in our constitution. AI does exactly the opposite. It is incapable of innovation. It
just com bines existing copyrighted works into an im itation. It cannot produce new ideas or new points of view on existing art. 
Even m ore im portantly it will destroy artists ability to m ake a living. Anyone saying otherwise is lying or has no idea what theyâ€™re talking
about. Artists are already losing work because em ployers who know nothing of art or aesthetic value think AI is an appropriate
replacem ent for artists. This will stop people m aking new art because they will be forced to find alternative m eans of m aking m oney and all
we will have is stagnant m eaningless slop that can never grow, im prove, enlighten us to new ideas, and can never m ove us because it will
never have had any connection to em otion. 
Would you allow AI to take over the job of legislation? It could easily do so. Just as it is im perative for hum an connection in m aking the
laws that govern us, art being m ade by hum ans artists is im perative to the hum an experience.
