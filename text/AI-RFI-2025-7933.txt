General Comment
Whoa whoa whoa. Let’s chill on the AI. It steals from  other sources and vom its out an accum ulation. It’s not original—it’s copying work
that already exists from  the labor of other people. Cool it. This needs way m ore regulations, including let’s be able to sue when AI steals
our hard work.
