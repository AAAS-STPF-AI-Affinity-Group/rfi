General Comment
This is absolutely ridiculous to allow. Why should a private com pany be im m une to lawsuits and be given special treatm ent? AI is not the
future and allowing this com pany to have free legal range to do whatever they want will lead to m ore seeking this special treatm ent in the
future. This will only harm  the citizens of this country.
