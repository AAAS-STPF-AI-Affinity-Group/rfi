General Comment
I am  a sm all business operator and artist based in the US. Generative AI already causes m assive headaches in every part of m y industry.
From  dropshipped products featuring generated artwork flooding Etsy and m aking it unusable for sm all handm ade item  owners, to AI
chat bot scam s infiltrating sales channels with fake exam ple/proof im ages, it's already a huge issue. I deal with clients thru Facebook
Marketplace, Craigslist, and Etsy weekly who have lost faith in artists and craftspeople because they are unsure if the things they are
seeing are real, or created by AI to take their m oney without delivering properly.
Whether or not it's created with the intent to scam , generative AI content scraped from  the creative work of Am ericans is being used to
displace jobs/gigs and swindle m oney from  hard-working residents of this country.
The unauthorized use of creative work to feed AI tools is unethical and we m ust have legal options to pursue dam ages. Fight back against
OpenAI protections.
