General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. Anything that requires flagrant theft to succeed doesn't deserve to exist. I don't
believe that com panies should get to profit off the hard work of everyday people just to m ake som ething that will result in m ass loses in
hum an jobs.
