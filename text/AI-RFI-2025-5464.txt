General Comment
AI is devastating net negative for culture and history. It destabilizes copywrite, devalues artwork and puts art in the hands of grifters and
thieves too lazy to develop the skills, acum en, m oral fiber and wherewithal to actually becom e an artist. At an educational level, it
com pletely underm ines critical thinking and student proactivity, enabling cheating, laziness, and half-wit thought. Not to m ention it is
woefully inaccurate about m ost things because it can't be expected to even accurately understand or even parse data. It is com pletely
useless, and equally as useless as the feckless idiots who prom ote and develop it. 
Do not allow AI, do not condone it, do not use it, and do not give it any leeway.
Let the AI com panies and grifter parasites that run them  starve.
