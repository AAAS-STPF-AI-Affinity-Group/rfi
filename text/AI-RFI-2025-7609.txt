General Comment
As an Am erican worker in creative industries, AI profits off theft of m y work and those of workers like m e. It devalues the efforts of
hard-working Am ericans in favor of poor-quality output that, while flashy and im pressive at a glance, is ultim ately insufficient as a
replacem ent. As im poverishing as this "good-enough" m iasm a is in creative works, I believe it is far m ore im poverishing culturally for
Am erica to strive for a world where artists and authors are driven out of existence.
It is absurd and abom inable that generative applications like these are allowed to freely strip-m ine the unique and hard-wrought creative
efforts of Am ericans without paym ent or credit. This is far from  "unnecessarily burdensom e", it is the bare m inim um .
Furtherm ore, I do not believe that "private sector AI innovation" is worthy of such special attention. Over the past several years, I have
seen such generative AI tools apply increasingly negative effects over tim e. My research efforts have been stym ied by blocks of
nonsensical texts, incorrect sum m aries, references to nonexistent works, and im ages that do not accurately depict the subjects they
purport to -- all enabled by these generative tools. I have seen incredible tools like the Internet becom e appreciably less useful over the
past few years. The m assive funneling of funds into these products and com panies strikes m e as wasteful and short-sighted. I do not
believe such generative AI holds a place in the future of the US.
