General Comment
This is not the right m ove in an effort to secure a future of creatives and expression. Generative artificial intelligence has no room  in our
society. This will benefit none except for thieves, and allowing AI to grow ram pant is a step back in society. Whatever happened to
creative expression and freedom  being encouraged?
