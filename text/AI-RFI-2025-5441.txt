General Comment
Why should it be legal for som eone to com m it intellectual property theft when it’s for a com puter program  that doesn’t work right half the
tim e, but illegal for m e to, hypothetically, sell a bootleg dvd? Why should any and all of m y personal inform ation and online habits be taken
without m y consent or com pensation to teach a com puter program  that, again, doesn’t work right half the tim e? Will this include
governm ent inform ation? Military inform ation?
