General Comment
I do not support giving OpenAI perm ission to use copyrighted m aterials without perm ission from  the rights holders. If the dom inance of
am erican AI relies on using the intellectual property of Am ericans without perm ission, then it is not worth it. There should not be a
copyright carveout for OpenAI just because they won't m ake as m uch m oney if they aren't perm itted to steal other people's work. In
addition, works created with AI should not be protected by copyright, as they were not created by a hum an.
