this is a very very very bad idea
AI steals and harm s hard working artists and if anything needs to be abolished not perm itted to keep stealing. 
This will harm  the US econom y and drive very hard working and talented artists and writers to stop doing what they love b/c it's just going
to get stolen with out any rem orse or repaym ent.
