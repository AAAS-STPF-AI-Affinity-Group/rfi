General Comment
AI should not be allowed to scan in copyrighted m aterial, just like I shouldn't be able to bottle brown liquid and sell it as coca-cola. If
artists lose the protection of copyright, culture dies. No person is allowed to pirate and plagiarize, then say "...but m y business plan
NEEDS it!" Don't believe they hype. All wn exem ption does is further enhance a m achine that m akes the shape of truth without truth.
