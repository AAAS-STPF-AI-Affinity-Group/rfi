General Comment
I am  a writer, software developer, and technologist. Any AI Action Plan m ust not undercut Copyright's incentive to create. Com panies
like OpenAI have deals with certain copyright holders to use their m aterial for training. However, these deals do not cover all of the
m aterial that is used for training. All copyright holders deserve to be paid when their intellectual property is used for training. Any AI
com pany that receives revenue from  the output of an AI m odel that is unable or unwilling to pay all copyright holders of the data used for
training should be required to pay royalties to those copyright holders. As an analogy, Canada has a "blank m edia levy" on m edia such as
blank CD-R's (blank recordable com pact discs). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_copying_levy) It is also reported that AI
com panies (in this case, Meta) rem ove copyright notices from  training data. ("Judge says Meta m ust defend claim  it stripped copyright info
from  Llam a's training fodder" https://www.theregister.com /2025/03/11/m eta_dm ca_copyright_rem oval_case/) This shows that AI
com panies are knowingly rem oving inform ation that could be used to connect AI m odel output with the authors of the copyrighted source
m aterial used for training. AI com panies should be required to retain this inform ation so that copyright holders can be properly
com pensated. Future AI m odels should be built with the capability to correctly and fully attribute the copyrighted m aterials used to
generate each output.
