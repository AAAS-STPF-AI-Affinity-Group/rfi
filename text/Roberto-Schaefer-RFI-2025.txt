The use of any AI, generative or not, MUST be strictly regulated. The idea that the USA has to 
attain superiority over China in the race for AI is grotesquely similar to the race for domination 
of the mine shafts that Dr. Strangelove's character exclaimed at the end of that satirical film from 
1964! To beat the Russians to the control over the mine shafts in the earth to protect against the 
nuclear fallout that was about to happen when the US accidentally attacked he USSR with a 
nuclear bomb. There is an hy sterical knee -jerk reaction by the entire current administration to 
have worldwide domination including the absurd ideas of buying Greenland, annexing Canada as 
the 521st state and controlling the Panama Canal, and that I fear is just the beginning. We mus t 
first protect our civil liberties from being stripped away under the guise of fear of China 
overtaking us in the race for better AI. And while they are proposing that the administration has 
cozied up to the tech giants who donated millions to get the pre sident elected. They are the ones 
who want to loosen the protections for their own financial gain only, not to be in the best 
interests of the people of the US. The federal government must not leave self -regulation as the 
guide rails to the implementation of AI which will decimate all of our first amendment rights, 
privacy and more. It must be regulated by a department of the government free from anyone or 
anything with a financial interest at stake.
