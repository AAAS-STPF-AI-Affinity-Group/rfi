General Comment
I am  an author, screenwriter, copyeditor and artist and I do not believe OpenAI or any type of generative AI/LLM system s have a place
in the future of the US. All of m y industries have been decim ated by job cuts caused by CEOs and hiring m anagers buying into false hype
about what AI is capable of, sending real hum an beings into financial crisis. The hum an and econom ic costs of buying in to the hype are
too great for the Am erican econom y to rem ain robust and allowing this technology to get a foothold anywhere, especially in governm ent,
will be disastrous.
