AI Action Plan for Reviewing U.S. Treasury Payments & USAID Funding for Corruption and 
Policy Conflicts  
 
1. Objectives & Use Cases  
 
The objective of this AI Action Plan  is to enhance oversight, accountability, and risk assessment  
in U.S. Treasury payments and USAID funding by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to detect 
fraud, corruption, misallocation of funds, and potential conflicts with U.S. policies or national 
security interests.  
 
Key AI Use Cases:  
• Fraud Detection & Anomaly Identification  – AI models to flag unusual financial transactions or 
suspicious funding allocations.  
• Policy Compliance Verification  – AI-driven audits to ensure payments align with U.S. laws, 
foreign policy, and security objectives.  
• Beneficiary & Vendor Screening  – AI cross-checking recipients against sanctions lists, criminal 
databases, and watchlists.  
• Real-Time Risk Scoring  – AI-generated risk scores for organizations, governments, or 
individuals receiving U.S. funds.  
• Supply Chain & Procurement Integrity Analysis  – AI tracking the flow of U.S. funds in 
government contracts and aid programs.  
• Duplicate & Shell Company Detection  – AI identifying fraudulent or duplicate aid recipients 
and shell corporations.  
• Geopolitical & Security Risk Analysis  – AI assessing funding impact in politically unstable or 
high-risk regions.  
• AI-Driven Predictive Analytics  – Forecasting potential corruption risks based on historical 
financial patterns.  
2. Assessment of Current Capabilities  
• Evaluate existing oversight mechanisms  in U.S. Treasury and USAID financial monitoring 
systems. 


• Assess AI readiness and data integration gaps  across federal financial and security agencies.  
• Identify inefficiencies in manual auditing and compliance reviews.  
• Analyze coordination challenges  between agencies such as the Treasury Department, USAID, 
FBI, and intelligence services.  
3. Technology & Infrastructure Requirements  
• AI-powered fraud detection algorithms  – Identifying irregularities in fund disbursement 
patterns. 
• Machine learning models for risk assessment  – Analyzing financial transaction trends for 
corruption signals.  
• Natural Language Processing (NLP) for policy compliance  – AI scanning contracts, 
agreements, and transactions for violations.  
• Blockchain & Smart Contracts  – Enhancing transparency and reducing financial fraud in aid 
distribution.  
• Geospatial AI Mapping  – Monitoring U.S. funds disbursed in foreign regions and detecting 
unusual allocation patterns.  
• Secure, Cloud -Based AI Platforms  – Real-time collaboration between Treasury, USAID, and 
oversight agencies.  
4. Data Strategy  
• Integrate financial transaction data  across Treasury, USAID, IRS, and global banking systems.  
• Establish AI -driven fraud risk models  using historical data on corruption cases.  
• Enhance real -time sanctions list screening  to prevent payments to sanctioned entities.  
• Automate compliance monitoring  for adherence to U.S. policies and foreign aid objectives.  
• Develop secure AI -powered dashboards  for auditors, investigators, and policymakers.  
5. Governance & Ethics  
• Establish AI governance frameworks  to ensure transparency and fairness in financial 
monitoring.  
• Develop cross -agency AI oversight policies  for Treasury, USAID, and national security 
agencies. 


• Ensure compliance with U.S. financial laws, data privacy regulations, and international 
transparency standards.  
• Mitigate AI bias risks  in fraud detection and funding decisions.  
6. Workforce & Training  
• Train auditors, investigators, and policymakers  on AI-based fraud detection and risk 
assessment.  
• Develop AI training programs  for Treasury and USAID personnel.  
• Deploy AI -powered decision support tools  to enhance human oversight in funding approvals.  
7. Implementation Roadmap  
 
Phase 1 (0 -12 Months)  
• Launch AI pilot projects for fraud detection and risk scoring  in Treasury and USAID 
disbursements.  
• Deploy AI-driven screening for beneficiaries and vendors  receiving U.S. funds.  
• Establish an AI Financial Oversight Task Force  to coordinate implementation across agencies.  
 
Phase 2 (1 -3 Years) 
• Expand real-time AI monitoring of Treasury payments and USAID grants.  
• Deploy predictive AI models  for identifying corruption risks before funds are disbursed.  
• Enhance AI-powered compliance audits  across federal agencies.  
 
Phase 3 (3 -5 Years) 
• Fully integrate AI-driven fraud detection, compliance monitoring, and risk assessments  into 
federal financial systems.  
• Implement AI-enhanced blockchain tracking  for USAID aid distribution.  


• Develop global AI partnerships  to enhance international transparency in aid funding.  
8. Risk Management  
• Cybersecurity vulnerabilities  – Implement AI -driven threat detection for Treasury and USAID 
financial systems.  
• False positives in fraud detection  – Maintain human oversight in AI -flagged risk assessments.  
• AI bias concerns  – Regular audits and fairness testing for AI decision models.  
• Regulatory compliance challenges  – Align AI initiatives with existing U.S. and international 
financial regulations.  
9. Monitoring & Optimization  
• Define AI performance KPIs  (e.g., fraud detection accuracy, policy compliance rates).  
• Deploy AI-driven financial oversight dashboards  for real-time monitoring.  
• Continuously improve AI models  using updated data on fraud, corruption, and financial risks.  
10. Change Management & Adoption  
• Engage Treasury, USAID, and law enforcement agencies  to align AI oversight strategies.  
• Develop public -private partnerships  for AI innovation in financial transparency.  
• Launch public awareness initiatives  on AI-driven oversight of government spending.  
This AI Action Plan for Treasury Payments & USAID Funding Oversight  will enhance financial 
transparency, fraud prevention, and policy compliance  while strengthening U.S. national security 
and anti-corruption efforts.
