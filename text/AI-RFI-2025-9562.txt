Response to the OSTP RFI: Advancing and Securing
Biological Foundation Models
1 Executive Summary
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the National Science Foundation’s and Office of Science
and Technology Policy’s request for information regarding the “Development of an Artificial Intelligence
Action Plan”.
The Brown AI Safety Team (BAIST) suggests that the current administration take decisive steps to
both harness the transformative potential of biological foundation models for the U.S. bioeconomy and
address associated security risks to ensure their responsible use. These models have the potential to
accelerate innovation in biotechnology, synthetic biology, and biomanufacturing1, positioning the U.S. as
a global leader in these fields. However, realizing these benefits requires addressing biosecurity concerns
that could otherwise hinder safe adoption and public trust. A proactive and rigorous assessment of
security risks will be key to fostering a thriving bioeconomy while mitigating potential misuse.
We propose two key areas of action:
1. Evaluating Risks from Biological Foundation Models : The U.S. AI Safety Institute (USAISI)
should lead an interagency initiative to comprehensively evaluate the risks of biological foundation mod-
els. These evaluations should determine the extent to which biological foundation models may lower
barriers to bioweapon development and increase bioweapons capabilities. This includes assessing their
role in enhancing pathogen design, evading medical countermeasures, and bypassing DNA sequence
screening. Risk mitigation strategies such as data filtering and model unlearning should also be empiri-
cally tested. To ensure information security and biosafety and to facilitate public-private partnerships,
the initiative should consist of multiple agencies such as DARPA, CDC, BARDA, NIH, and NIST.
2. Expanding the “Data for the Bioeconomy Initiative” to Include Biological Foundation
Models: We recommend integrating biological foundation models into the existing Data Initiative
under Executive Order 14081. This would involve establishing a structured framework for secure
access, interoperability, and responsible use of these models within scientific and industrial applications.
Establishing this infrastructure could allow the US bioeconomy to securely harness the full capabilities
of biological foundation models.
Through these targeted actions, the U.S. can ensure that biological foundation models contribute to
biotechnology and biomanufacturing advancements while addressing emerging security challenges. A
proactive, evidence-based approach will allow the government to craft policies that enhance biosecurity

without unduly hindering technological progress.
2 Background on Biological Foundation Models
Biological foundation models are similar to large language models (LLMs), except they are trained
on massive amounts of protein or DNA sequences instead of natural language. Biological foundation
models have already revolutionized multiple scientific and industrial fields, such as protein engineering,
synthetic biology, and genomics. For instance, AlphaFold2has achieved groundbreaking success in
predicting protein structures with near-experimental accuracy, transforming structural biology and
drug discovery. However, biological foundation models may simultaneously present unprecedented
security challenges. Biological foundation models may both lower barriers to bioweapon development
and increase bioweapon capabilities, thus creating unprecedented opportunities for malicious non-state
actors3. As biological foundation models continue to rapidly scale up4, we anticipate huge opportunities
for the US bioeconomy as well as increased security concerns.
3 Evaluating risks from Biological Foundation Models
3.1 Evaluation Framework
The misuse risks of biological foundation models have been discussed at length but lack comprehen-
sive empirical evidence. To avoid regulation that would unduly stifle the US bioeconomy and instead
promote evidence-based policies, we propose commissioning the US AI Safety Institute (USAISI) to
evaluate to what extent biological foundation models can increase malicious misuse risks. These eval-
uations may focus on, but are not limited to, the following questions:
1. Given some fixed amount of resources (laboratory equipment and reagents, time, labor, etc), to
what extent can a non-state actor enhance a pathogen’s virulence and transmissibility with the
help of biological foundation models, compared to other AI and non-AI methods?
2. Conversely, how many fewer resources does a non-state actor need to surpass some target pathogen
enhancement with the help of biological foundation models, compared to other AI and non-AI
methods?
3. To what extent can a non-state actor use biological foundation models to digitally design func-
tional pathogenic DNA sequences, without physical experiments, that do not get flagged by DNA
sequence screening tools5(see Section 3.2)?
4. To what extent can a non-state actor use biological foundation models to design pathogens that
evade medical countermeasures, such as vaccines, rapid antigen tests, and monoclonal antibodies?
We also encourage evaluating how various safe model development approaches affect the above scenarios.
Two notable safety approaches are:
1.Filtering training data: Remove DNA/protein sequences of concern from the model’s training
data.
2.Unlearning : Implement unlearning methods6after training that decrease the model’s useful-
ness in potentially harmful applications, such as designing enhanced viruses, while preserving
neutral/beneficial applications, such as modeling drug-protein interactions.

These approaches must be tested against fine-tuning procedures, such as fine-tuning on open-source
mutation-effect datasets, as they may undo any safety gains.
We recognize that these evaluations may require or be strengthened by the physical synthesis of en-
hanced pathogens. To avoid accidental release of enhanced pathogens, we suggest a stratified approach:
1.In Silico Evaluations : Prioritize initial assessments and threat modeling in purely computa-
tional environments with appropriate cybersecurity measures.
2.Harmless Biological Proxies: Use harmless proxies to validate and refine computational mod-
els without risking accidental outbreaks. For instance, to evaluate threats of virus design, only use
isolated proteins, pseudotyped viruses or virus-like particles, or viruses with low pathogenicity,
such as adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). These experiments can be done in less secure labs, such
as BSL-2 or BSL-3 labs7.
3.Secure Pathogen Experiments : Limit experiments using functional pathogens strictly to
justified cases under stringent biosafety oversight.
We expect that a majority of evaluations can be done with the first and second approaches, albeit with
some accuracy trade-offs.
We emphasize maintaining and strengthening the USAISI’s role rather than disbanding or diluting its
responsibilities. However, we anticipate that the USAISI alone will not have the capacity or necessary
expertise to execute physical experiments, ensure biosafety, and implement appropriate cybersecurity
protocols. We thus encourage collaboration with other agencies, such as the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Biomedical
Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). We also suggest collaboration with the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
to facilitate public-private partnerships, particularly with academics in relevant areas and developers
of biological foundation models.
3.2 DNA Sequence Screening
DNA sequence screening is an essential target for regulation, as successful bioweapon development
by non-state actors is highly contingent on ordering DNA sequences from DNA synthesis companies.
However, there are currently no widely-adopted standardized approaches to DNA sequence screening
nor government mandates to implement effective screening. Securing sequence screening is becoming
increasingly urgent as biological foundation models may enable non-state actors to entirely circumvent
sequence screening. Red-teaming these screening tools by testing them on AI-designed sequences can
reveal vulnerabilities and spur DNA synthesis companies to improve their protocols. Wittmann et
al.8carried out such an exercise. They worked directly with DNA synthesis companies to red-team
their tools, revealed and reported a possible vulnerability to AI-designed sequences, and gave DNA
synthesis companies enough time to fix their protocols before publishing the work. While their efforts
are remarkable, we cannot solely rely on independent or industry-led initiatives to comprehensively
secure sequence screening. Government agencies should work on these red-teaming experiments because
they can operate on a much larger scale – they can convene many more DNA synthesis companies, carry
out more involved experiments, and can more reliably manage infohazards.
3.3 Potential Policy Actions
These evaluations would provide high-quality evidence to guide (or discourage) policy. If these evalua-
tions reveal substantial potential for the misuse of biological foundation models, we suggest exploring

the following regulations and guidelines:
1.Developer reporting requirements: Mandate, incentivize, or suggest transparent documen-
tation of model capabilities, training data sources, and safety protocols.
2.Safety standards and benchmarks: Establish clear criteria for acceptable levels of risk and
necessary security features in biological foundation models.
3.Access controls: Develop tiered access systems to limit potential misuse without restricting
legitimate scientific and industrial innovation. For instance, users in lower tiers can access atten-
uated models without capabilities related to enhancing pathogens, while users in higher tiers can
access models with full capabilities. Access controls may be facilitated by creating centralized
infrastructure that manages and integrates biological foundation models with an array of curated
biological datasets, as discussed in Section 4.
4.Improving oversight and safety of dual-use research: Use results of safety evaluations to
inform accurate risk assessments of legitimate research that uses biological foundation models
to study pathogens. This could alleviate the oversight burden on federal funding agencies and
researchers, following the United States Government Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research
of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential. Furthermore, safety results can
inform risk mitigation strategies for dual-use research. Specifically, biological foundation models
can help replace physical experimentation with computational modeling to decrease the risk of
accidental leakage
5.Improving DNA sequence screening : As discussed in Section 3.2, safety evaluations of bio-
logical foundation models can reveal vulnerabilities in DNA sequence screening tools. Subsequent
fixes can then inform amendments to government DNA sequence screening guidelines9. These fixes
may include methods assisted by biological foundation models, which the USAISI-led interagency
group may wish to research alongside safety evaluations.
In conclusion, carefully assessing the misuse risks of biological foundation models through structured
evaluations and robust collaboration among public agencies, private entities, and academic institutions
is crucial. Implementing transparent and informed regulatory measures, along with rigorous evaluations
of safety approaches such as data filtering and model unlearning, can help mitigate potential threats.
Additionally, proactively red-teaming DNA sequence screening protocols will enhance biosecurity pre-
paredness and resilience. These coordinated actions will ensure the secure and responsible advancement
of the bioeconomy without unnecessarily hindering growth and innovation.
4 Expanding the “Data for the Bioeconomy Initiative” to Include
Biological Foundation Models
The “Data for the Bioeconomy Initiative” (Data Initiative), established under Section 4 of Executive
Order 1408110, is a U.S. government-wide effort aimed at providing high-quality, accessible, interop-
erable, and secure biological data infrastructure. By collecting and curating diverse biological data
sources, the Data Initiative aims to drive scientific discovery and innovation across health, agriculture,
environmental science, and biomanufacturing.
We recommend expanding the scope of the Data Initiative to include biological foundation models.
Similar to biological datasets, biological foundation models hold significant potential to support in-
novation by providing foundational capabilities for downstream applications in biotechnology, protein
engineering, synthetic biology, and genomics.

Packaging biological foundation models together with their associated datasets — both for initial train-
ing and fine-tuning — can substantially streamline research and accelerate scientific breakthroughs.
For example, researchers in enzyme engineering could fine-tune a general protein model on enzyme
function datasets. Integrating the resulting model into research and development could significantly
reduce experimental time and resources.
Biological foundation models face similar challenges as biological datasets, including fragmentation
across academic and industrial entities, substantial computational resource demands, and associated
security risks. Applying FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles can ad-
dress these challenges:
•Findable: Develop a comprehensive registry of biological foundation models categorized by their
intended applications, training data, safety practices, architectures, and computational require-
ments.
•Accessible: Provide basic computational resources for operating these models, considering insti-
tutional or cloud-based resources, possibly differentiating pricing structures for inference versus
fine-tuning tasks.
•Interoperable: Standardize data formats for embedding and fine-tuning datasets, facilitating
ease of use and integration across research contexts.
•Reproducible: Document training procedures, datasets, architectures, and safety evaluations,
with appropriate precautions to manage information hazards.
Security is a significant concern for biological foundation models, given their potential misuse for
bioweapons development by non-state actors (see Section 3 for more details). If safety evaluations
reveal substantial risks, implementing tiered access controls could mitigate these risks:
1. Provide restricted, less capable model versions to lower-credential users, applying effective safety
methods while granting full access to higher-credential users.
2. Clearly differentiate access between inference and fine-tuning, with stricter controls for fine-tuning.
3. Limit direct downloading of sensitive models; instead, use federated access, where users submit
jobs to centralized, secure computational infrastructure. This environment can monitor inputs
and outputs for subversive or unsafe actions.
Platforms like HuggingFace already facilitate access to biological foundation models. HuggingFace,
however, lacks sufficient interoperability with a wide array of curated biological datasets. Integrating
biological foundation models with future data infrastructure created through the Data Initiative would
enable comprehensive interoperability. HuggingFace also does not emphasize security and safety. The
Data Initiative could either guide or partner with HuggingFace to strengthen these areas or establish
a dedicated platform inspired by precedents such as NIH’s dbGaP11.
Public-private partnerships involving model developers, industry, and academia could further ensure
practical, secure, and broadly useful implementations. These partnerships should define feasible ap-
proaches to balance open scientific innovation with necessary security measures, addressing both do-
mestic and international considerations.
Ultimately, including biological foundation models within the Data Initiative or establishing a comple-
mentary initiative could significantly enhance U.S. leadership in biotechnology and biomanufacturing
innovation while responsibly addressing the associated security challenges.
