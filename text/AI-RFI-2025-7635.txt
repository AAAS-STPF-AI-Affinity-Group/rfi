General Comment
First of all, no. Absolutely no “AI” autocorrect but worse.
Second of all, you all clearly need to be told that we would like robots to do the dishes and wash the floors, not interpret hum ans, draw
things, or write stories. If the people m aking this stuff ever figured out that they have to be likeable people who practiced at stuff to get
better at it, we wouldn’t be here. But here we are with m ediocre nitwits who want to take shortcuts off of cliffs because they decided to
rem ove the guardrails.
So, no AI and please go yeet yourself into the sun.
