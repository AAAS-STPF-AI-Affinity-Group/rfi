General Comment
There's little reason for an individual to go into the arts anym ore. Now that AI creates it at the press of a button real artists struggle to even
survive on their craft.
If we rid artists of even the basic credibility of the art they them selves have built we'll very possibly lose art forever.
I com pel you to think of AI as a tool that should take over the tasks hum ans do not wish to do - such as the laundry, the windows, or
tuning up the fam ily car. AI should not replace hum ans for the things that m ake hum ans feel hum an. 
Use AI to raise the standard of living - not to steal and forge works of art.
