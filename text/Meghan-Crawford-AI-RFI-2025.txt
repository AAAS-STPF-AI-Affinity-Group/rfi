AI lowers the humans ability to critically think and it is something more then a glorified find  
and replace. Allowing this is allowing the dessicration of human writing and record keeping. I  
do not want AI. I do not need it. The ai the Grammer checks me can barely do its job. Do not  
let AI steal people's hard word.
