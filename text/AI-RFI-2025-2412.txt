General Comment
This is a HORRIBLE idea. This plan will destroy the livelihoods and creations of every creative person in the country. Big tech will take
everything and we will end up in a society where corperations can ignore the CONSTITUTION to get their slim y hands on m ore m oney
they certainly DO NOT need while sim ultaneously destroying the lives of countless Am ericans, and even others around the world.
Creativity m ust be in the hands of hum ans, NOT souless m achines. This bill MUST NOT PASS.
