General Comment
Continuing to chase and acquiesce to AI com panies' flagrant disregard for copyright and basic respect for hum ans will only further
dam age this country's national security, efficacy, and cultural baseline for alm ost zero positive results. AI holds a negative place in the
future of the United States, and should not be allowed to continue unabated.
AI com panies literally profit off the theft of the creative output of the Am erican people, and their continual, exponential need for m aterial
and energy will cripple this nation. Their grift should not be the priority of the United States.
