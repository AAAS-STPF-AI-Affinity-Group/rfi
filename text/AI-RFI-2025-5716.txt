General Comment
AI initiatives like this do nothing to im prove the lives of US citizens. Instead they prom ote blatant theft of the work and resources of real
people. This sort of thing has a dem onstrably negative im pact on the lives of the Am erican people and we should not be pursuing it. It is
reprehensible to steal from  the hard work of people in this country to develop system s that will only m ake those sam e people “obsolete”
while only churning out subpar content. Anyone who has worked in a creative industry is already fam iliar with the lackluster results that
you get from  AI and the dam age it does to real people. Rem oving som e of the very few m ethods that we have to try to protect our lives
and jobs from  this garbage is a terrible idea.
