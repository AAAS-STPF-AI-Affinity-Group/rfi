General Comment
Hello, I am  an artist and I am  here to say NO to AI! Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), im age diffusion m odels, and other
sim ilar tools are a gross violation of our rights to our own intellectual property and the United States should not support these
technologies. They actively harm  the Am erican people's ability to function, and all it would take is a large foreign governm ent filling the
Internet with propaganda, or gaining influence with the developers of these technologies, to unduly influence the Am erican people with
m isinform ation. The technology is also unreliable, it gets things wrong constantly even without interference, and it is not suitable for any
serious use case and it never will be.
The im age generation tools (such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E) are also harm ful. They will not strengthen industries such as film  and
video gam es (two incredibly profitable Am erican industries), they will destroy them . We will lose this export and cause m any to lose their
jobs if the United States invests in this technology.
I can go on about how these tools work and why they're incapable of doing the work real Am erican workers already do, but I know this
isn't the place. Just understand that they sim ply do not work. 
As an Am erican citizen who cares about art and hum anity, and cares about not giving any m ore power to corrupt corporations who intend
to lie and m islead us, I vote NO to AI! NO TO AI! NO TO AI! NO TO AI!
