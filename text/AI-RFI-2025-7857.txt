General Comment
I oppose this proposal, which would enshrine organized theft of intellectual property as the basis of national policy. It would also deprive
Congress of the power entrusted to it by the fram ers in Article I, section 8 of the US Constitution to establish copyright protections. 
Corporations are supposed to be enterprising, not engines of learned helplessness excused from  contributing to the general welfare of the
land and people of the United States. Now it appears they can’t develop AI without stealing the raw m aterials - text and content - from
the people who created it. 
The vast am ounts of water needed to generate the energy for an AI project will not be available for any other use, including firefighting,
irrigation, and supplying public water system s. 
AI has not been shown to be a public good, so this proposal to develop an action plan is prem ature. Should it ever be established that AI
is a public good, the Fifth Am endm ent to the Constitution prohibits “taking without just com pensation” the property, including the
intellectual property, of any person, in order to produce a thing alleged to have public value. 
This proposal is a broad, reckless license to violate the Constitution on two fronts. It’s lawless and should be rejected.
