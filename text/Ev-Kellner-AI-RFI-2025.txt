The field of AI is being gate -kept by computer scientists who think because they programmed the 
tool or have a deep understanding of algorithms and computer science, they deserve to be the only 
ones in the field. Demand AI be governed by makers and users, coders and custodians, innovators 
and ethicists - or watch democracy itself become another algorithm to be hacked. Did those who 
landed on Normandy work in the factory making the guns? The Wright Brothers engineered flight, 
but pilots, regulators, and pass engers shaped its evolution. Henry Ford mass -produced cars, but 
society-built highways, safety laws, and public transit Break the status quo when hiring AI USERS - 
not PROGRAMMERS. The AI revolution is being hijacked by a cabal of elites and code -obsessed 
engineers who think their GitHub commits give them divine right to dictate humanity's future. 
Meanwhile, China's 100+ AI Innovation Zones - run by farmers, factory bosses, and party hacks - are 
eating our lunch with brute -force experimentation, while Ameri ca's timid tech elite cling to their 
share h algorithms like sacred texts. To conservatives: These Silicon Valley "experts" are 
squandering American dominance. They'd rather virtue -signal about "ethical AI" in air -conditioned 
conferences than unleash the e ntrepreneurs, mechanics, and soldiers who could weaponize AI to 
outpace China's ruthless hustle. Beijing doesn't ask PhDs for permission to test facial recognition 
on 1 billion people - they act. We're too busy gatekeeping job listings with "Python profici ency" to let 
a Midwest factory foreman reimagine AI -driven manufacturing. To progressives: Wake up! By letting 
Silicon Valley computer scientists monopolize AI development, we're replicating the same 
exclusionary systems we claim to hate. China's innovatio n zones - for all their dystopian risks - at 
least include street vendors, miners, and state hacks in their AI experiments. Meanwhile, our 
"inclusive" tech class shuts out teachers, nurses, and union reps from shaping AI tools that will 
automate their jobs . If only the privileged get to code the future, whose biases get hardwired? 
Here's the truth: China's AI isn't better - it's hungrier. They'll let a Shenzhen sweatshop boss plug 
ChatGPT into a drone assembly line tomorrow, no ethics or institutional revie w board required. 
America? We've got Ivy League grads writing 10 -page fairness manifestos while China gobbles rare 
earth minerals drag and dropping patents. We're losing because our "experts" value technical purity 
over real-world grit. Break the cult of c redentials. Let the red -state farmer use AI to repair his own 
Tractor. Let the Bronx teacher use ChatGPT to help teach. Let veterans do what they want with it; 
they served our country. If we don't democratize AI hiring - fast - we'll be ruled by two tyranni es. 
China's ruthless pragmatism and our own arrogant technocracy. The stakes? freedom itself. This is 
not a partisan issue - it's a war for the soul of the next generation, waged by algorithms weaponized 
to addict, radicalize, and commodify our children. C orporations like Meta - shielded by armies of 
lobbyists - prioritize profit over human dignity, turning screens into digital opium while dodging 
accountability with performative outrage. They exploit your child's mind, harvesting data and 
attention spans, yet demand we treat them as "innovators," not predators. Meanwhile, authoritarian 
regimes like China enforce draconian safeguards - one hour of gaming weekly for minors - because 
even dictators recognize unchecked tech erodes societal control. Yet in Ameri ca, bipartisan 
cowardice lets CEOs plunder our children's futures. Conservatives tolerate it, dismissing 18+ for 
Instagram as "government overreach," while progressives cower, fearing criticism of... losing money. 
This dystopia where kids are lab rats for Silicon Valley's greed. This is cultural suicide. If we fail to 
act, the next generation won't just speak Mandarin in classrooms - they'll inherit a world where their 


thoughts, relationships, and freedoms are auctioned to the highest bidder. Parents lose. Did you 
know if Tik Tok's algorithm sees a young American looking at content to enlist in the military, they 
will start seeing videos on doing drugs and be recommended  to follow drug dealers. How is this 
allowed on our soil? Where is the outrage? The left won't admit that "innovation" has become 
exploitation. The right won't confront corporations shredding family values for profit. Politicians 
protect donors, not kids. Your grandchild's future? Sold for stock surges and shareholder smiles as 
they are taught elementary school in Chinese. This isn't about red or blue - it's about human dignity 
versus algorithmic tyranny. If we value freedom, family, or a functioning societ y, we'll tear down this 
normalized exploitation. "Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei, Led us to this perfect day. Marx, Wood, Wei 
and Christ, All but Wei were sacrificed."
