General Comment
Historically, US copyright holders have fought tooth and nail to protect their Intellectual Property, from  big corporations to independent
artists. If OpenAI and other AI developers wants to train their m odels with copyrighted content, as they have often requested in their
m anifestos, then do the sam e thing that every person needs to do to use those: pay the licenses. 
If your business m odel cannot exist without breaking the law, it is not a business m odel that m akes it worth it. I m ay not enjoy or agree
with the current use of generative AI, but for a goverm ent point of view, an AI trained on m edia that requires copyright doesn't m ake
sense. AI usage should be reserved for data analysis, m edical developm ent, scientific research, given the infrastructure cost and
envirom ental dam age, not generating im ages that m ock hum an creativity.
Invest in the hum ans that create. A nation doesn't exist on m oney alone, it has a need for culture.
