General Comment
I dont usually do this sort of thing, but on this I felt I had to speak up. AI com panies do not deserve special exem ption from  laws m erely
because AI is new and innovative. Already the hype behind it has started slowing down. Within a year or two, it'll be rem em bered as a
passing fad. Certainly ly there m ay be m inor integrations of it into som e products and services, but it will not be a fulcrum  on which the
world turns. 90% of current recent AI applications are solutions in search of a problem , scram bling to srptring together enough buzz
words to justify their own existence. New does not justify special exem ptions to the law. If a com pany wants to develop an AI, they m ust
do so legally and ethically. Hum an creativity and creative sovereignty cannot be tram pled for the sake of m aking a m achine which
specializes in optim izing the tram pling process.
