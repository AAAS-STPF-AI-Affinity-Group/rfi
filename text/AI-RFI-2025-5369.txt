General Comment
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. It does not reflect our countryâ€™s values to allow this technology to
steal from  the painters, writers, poets, photographers, film m akers, and all other artists without recognition, attribution, or com pensation.
Any argum ents to the contrary are fleecing the eyes of the people.
