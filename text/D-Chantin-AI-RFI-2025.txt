Please consider adding education and workforce training in the development of an AI action 
plan. This includes formal training of AI experts at the undergraduate and graduate level. 
Scholarships to these students with possibility of a service obligation to the US government will 
bolster the government's AI team. Training of the current workforce is also important as AI is 
becoming more pervasive in every industry - this could be through workshops (online a nd/or in-
person) and could be basic or advanced. Moreover, the community needs to be educated about 
AI - this could take the form of workshops, talks, etc.
