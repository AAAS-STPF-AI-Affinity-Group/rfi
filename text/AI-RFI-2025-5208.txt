General Comment
Large language learning AI m odels are a terrible bet. They are anything but intelligent and have no use case outside of m aking bad art and
worse search engines, or taking services that could be perform ed by a hum an and doing it worse in general. In particular, this affects m y
ability to be a productive as m anagem ent types believe they can replace low paid program m ers with chatbots, using the code they output
wholesale for tasks without any sort of sanity checking, causing hundreds of bugs and huge am ounts of lost work hours in the race to
replace hum anity. It is inefficient, it is costly, and it is stupid to take the guard rails off this.
