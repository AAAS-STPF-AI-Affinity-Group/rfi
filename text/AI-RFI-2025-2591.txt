General Comment
My nam e is Brandon and I am  a photographer by trade whose photos have been used for AI training m odels against m y will and have
never received any apology or com pensation for it. My issue with any AI technology is the push to build these m odels without any
consideration of ethics. The prom ise of AI m odels to help with the future seem s to elim inate any form  of hum an expression rather than be
used as a tool to help with progress in fields like science or technology. AI as I have seen it be used has only been to replace, rehash, and
stagnate the progression of cultural production. AI at this point seem s to be m ore of a buzzword and pum p-and-dum p schem e for tech
m inded individuals to m ake a quick buck as a novelty. There is no regulation over this industry and it desperately needs it.
