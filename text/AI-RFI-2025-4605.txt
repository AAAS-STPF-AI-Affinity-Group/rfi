General Comment
I am  sending this com m ent to say as an artist and academ ic that I am  very m uch opposed to rem oving restrictions on regulations,
especially copyright restrictions to train AI. As of now, com panies like OpenAI have failed to prove that generate a public good that
elevates them  above the regulations that the rest of this country m ust obey.
It's clear that AI corporations have the potential to reap enorm ous profits off the labor of others without their consent or their benefit.
Furtherm ore, there is no clear guarantee that data will be handled in an ethical or responsible m anner, with involved parties not even
knowing how their inform ation is used.
In addition, current AI dem ands place an extrem e burden on our already underdeveloped infrastructure, harm ing com m unities who often
have no say in their installation (see data centers).
I im plore the adm inistration to not only keep current regulations in place, but to further restrict these com panies abilities to access
resources without fair com pensation.
