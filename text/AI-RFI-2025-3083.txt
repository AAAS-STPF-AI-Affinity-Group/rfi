General Comment
AI needs to be reigned in and given STRICT guidelines on how to operate. Letting it access any data regardless of copyright or
ownership is the absolute worst thing to do and should not be allowed under any circum stances. Safeguards need to be put in place to
protect intellectual property from  being scraped by AI.
