General Comment
AI is theft, pure and sim ple. It doesn’t need help and real people who are not m ega corporations don’t want it. This is being shoved down
our throats and we absolutely do not need it. It creates a uniform ity and blandness that is contrary to the ideals of Am erican innovation. It
is not legal to use som eone’s voice or picture without consent, so why should AI be able to do it too? I do not support this action!
