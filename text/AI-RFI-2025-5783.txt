General Comment
Ai hurts Americans and American b usinesses. Artists income is based aro und a lot of co mmercial work, a nd ai stea ls the work from t hose 
artists for prof it. It also steals work that’s been com missioned by compan ies under copyri ght. And busi nesses that bl indly use ai 
create  work that is not copyri ghtable and that they can pass off as the work of artists they did not actual ly hire. It’s real ly&^%  
and bad for artists, writers, and other creati ve fields.
