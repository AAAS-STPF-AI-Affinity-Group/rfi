General Comment
I do not believe Artificial Intelligence holds a profitable or productive place in the future of the United States of Am erica. AI steals from
the livelihood of hard-working Am ericans and profits off the theft of real, hum an production. The unrealized hype and hope of AI is
blinding the Am erican public to the real-world risks and harm s the technology causes, such as disproportionate com petition for resources
that people need for their hom es, businesses, and com m unities. AI is a speculative m arket with false prom ises to fool the public; it's a
speculative bubble waiting to pop, and the concerns with data security risk the integrity of the inform ation we access and rely on every
day. We can do better with our own m inds, our own hands, our ingenuity, and our industriousness, controlling technology ourselves.
