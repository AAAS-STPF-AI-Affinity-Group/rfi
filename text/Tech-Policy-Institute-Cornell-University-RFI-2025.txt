I. Executive Summary
The future of warfare demands leaner, smarter, and more cost -effective solutions that maximize U.S. 
military readiness while minimizing waste. Artificial intelligence offers a force -multiplier effect, 
enabling strategic decision -making at machine speed, re ducing operational redundancies, and 
optimizing force deployment —without excessive increases in personnel, procurement, or logistics. 
AI-driven simulations and autonomous decision -making tools provide an opportunity to enhance 
combat effectiveness, reduce costs, and ensure the U.S. maintains a strategic advantage in an era of 
constrained defense budgets.  
The Tech Policy Institute at Cornell is leading this transformation by developing AI agents for 
wargaming simulations, ensuring that AI -driven battlefield decision -making is stress -tested in 
dynamic, adversarial environments before live deployment. Unlike traditional defense approaches 
that rely on costly field exercises and large -scale hardware investments, our high -fidelity simulations, 
multi -agent AI training, and strategic forecasting allow decision -makers to refine tactics, predict 
adversary behavior, and adapt to emerging threats at a fraction of the cost.  
By integrating technical innovation, doctrinal adaptation, and policy development, the Tech Policy 
Institute at Cornell ensures that AI -driven warfare is not just cutting -edge—but also cost -effective, 
scalable, and strategically sound. Our research is desi gned to help the U.S. military streamline 
decision -making, optimize force structure, and modernize operations without bloated spending or 
inefficiencies.  
In an era where doing more with less is a national security imperative, AI -driven defense strategies 
are not just an advantage —they are a necessity. The Tech Policy Institute at Cornell is committed to 
shaping this future, ensuring that AI innovations driv e smarter, faster, and more efficient military 
capabilities that align with U.S. strategic objectives.  


2II. The Need for an AI -Driven Military Strategy
AI as a Force Multiplier for the U.S. and Allied Forces  
The United States and its allies face increasing operational demands while navigating resource 
constraints, shrinking force structures, and evolving adversary capabilities. To maintain global 
military superiority, the U.S. and its partners must move beyond  traditional force models and 
integrate AI as a force multiplier across all domains —land, air, sea, space, and cyber. AI -driven real -
time sensor fusion can synthesize intelligence across ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and 
Reconnaissance) platforms, allow ing the U.S. and its allies to identify and respond to threats faster 
than peer competitors. Machine -speed analysis of satellite, drone, and battlefield sensors will give 
commanders an asymmetric advantage in future conflicts. AI -assisted targeting —integra ted with 
next-generation battle networks —can enhance precision strike capabilities, kinetic and non -kinetic 
targeting, and force protection, reducing reliance on human reaction time in high -threat 
environments. Meanwhile, AI -driven predictive logistics and  autonomous resupply can increase 
operational endurance, reducing the vulnerabilities of long supply lines and ensuring rapid force 
mobilization in contested regions.  
For the U.S., AI extends force projection, reduces personnel burden, and accelerates battlefield 
decision -making, allowing smaller, more agile forces to compete with numerically superior 
adversaries. For allies, AI integration enhances interoperability and  offsets capability gaps, ensuring 
coalition forces remain resilient in high -intensity operations. These applications are not futuristic; 
they are necessary today to maintain strategic advantage in a battlespace increasingly defined by 
speed, adaptability,  and data -driven decision -making.  
Shifting from Ethical Paralysis to Accelerationism  
Current U.S. AI policy is reactive, shaped primarily by ethical concerns, bureaucratic inertia, and 
adversary -led advancements. While strategic competitors —particularly China —are rapidly deploying 
AI for both battlefield and hybrid warfare applications, th e U.S. has hesitated to operationalize AI 
beyond narrow, controlled experiments due to fears of automation, transparency concerns, and 
outdated risk calculations. This risk -averse stance threatens to cede decision dominance to near -peer 
competitors.  
To counter this, the U.S. must abandon the Cold War -era procurement mindset that treats AI as an 
add-on to existing platforms. AI -enabled warfare fundamentally transforms decision -making, force 
posture, and operational tempo. The Pentagon must accelerate b attlefield AI deployment across 
strategic, tactical, and autonomous systems rather than waiting for regulatory certainty or adversary 
escalation. AI is not just another weapons system —it demands entirely new doctrinal and 
operational models. The focus must  shift toward human -machine teaming, where AI enhances 
warfighter situational awareness, target selection, and adaptive combat decision -making without 
eliminating human control.  


3Additionally, AI must be tested not only in simulations and wargames but also in live, high -tempo 
operational environments. Developing adaptive combat AI systems requires continuous learning and 
refinement in real -time conflict scenarios. Without this shif t, the U.S. risks deploying AI systems that 
remain untested under real -world pressures, giving adversaries the ability to define the pace and 
shape of AI -driven warfare. By embracing an accelerationist strategy, the U.S. can dictate the future 
of AI warfar e, ensuring that battlefield AI remains a strategic advantage rather than an existential 
vulnerability. The question is not whether AI will dominate future conflicts, but who will wield it 
most effectively —the United States cannot afford to wait.  
III. Key AI Policy Actions Needed
Developing Modular, Adaptive AI Architectures  
Traditional weapons development follows a platform -centric model, where systems are designed for 
specific domains (land, air, sea, cyber, space) and updated slowly over time. This approach is 
incompatible with AI -driven warfare, where adaptability and real -time learning are crucial to 
maintaining an edge over adversaries. AI systems must be modular, allowing for seamless integration 
across multiple military domains, and adaptive, capable of continuous battlefield learning and real -
time operational adjustmen ts. Furthermore, AI must be interoperable with NATO and allied forces, 
ensuring that U.S. -led advancements in AI -driven warfare provide a collective advantage rather than 
an isolated capability.  
Institutionalizing Continuous AI Iteration in Military Procurement  
The Department of Defense’s procurement process remains too slow and rigid to accommodate 
AI’s rapid evolution. The traditional "develop, test, and deploy" model is insufficient when 
adversaries can update AI -enabled systems in near real -time. To keep pace , the U.S. must transition 
from static acquisitions to an agile, iterative AI development cycle. This requires establishing real -
time battlefield AI feedback loops, allowing AI models to refine their decision -making processes 
based on live operational data . Continuous software updates must be deployed to already -fielded 
systems, ensuring they do not become obsolete. Additionally, the U.S. must invest in dynamic 
testing environments that simulate contested battlespaces, enabling AI to adapt rapidly to evolvi ng 
threats. AI cannot remain confined to controlled lab environments —it must be tested and evolved 
in live, high -tempo conflict scenarios.  
AI Agents and Wargaming: Stress -Testing Autonomous Warfare  
A key element of advancing AI -driven warfare is the development and deployment of AI agents 
capable of operating in both simulated and real -world military environments. AI agents —
autonomous or semi -autonomous systems designed for tactical, operational, and  strategic decision -
making —serve as critical enablers for real -time decision dominance. These agents can be embedded 
in command -and-control (C2) systems, battlefield simulations, and autonomous combat platforms, 


4ensuring the U.S. maintains a competitive edge in both warfighting scenarios and strategic planning 
exercises.  
To accelerate AI battlefield readiness and deployability, the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell proposes 
leveraging wargaming as a core methodology for refining AI capabilities. Wargaming provides a safe 
but realistic testing ground for AI -driven decision -making, allowing AI agents to be stress -tested in 
dynamic, adversarial environments before they are deployed in live operations. By embedding multi -
agent AI systems within military simulations, red -teaming exercises, and operational planning 
scenarios, the U.S. can systematically evaluate AI’s effectiveness, adaptability, and resilience against 
human and machine opponents.  
Wargaming also serves as a crucial policy validation tool, enabling military planners and 
policymakers to anticipate second - and third -order effects of AI warfare strategies. AI -powered 
wargames allow defense leaders to simulate escalatory scenarios, measu re risk in real -time, and refine 
AI-human coordination protocols to prevent unintended consequences in combat. Additionally, 
adversarial AI wargaming —where AI systems are pitted against each other in unscripted, evolving 
conflicts —can expose vulnerabilitie s and drive continuous iteration in AI warfare algorithms.  
For AI to be truly effective in military operations, it must be battle -tested before the battle itself. 
The Tech Policy Institute at Cornell is uniquely positioned to lead in this domain by integrating AI 
agents into next -generation military wargaming plat forms, providing a critical bridge between 
technical innovation, strategic doctrine, and operational execution. Through the strategic application 
of AI agents in combat simulations, the U.S. can ensure that AI -driven warfare is not just an abstract 
capabil ity but a refined, combat -ready advantage in future conflicts.  
Reforming AI Policy Beyond Defensive Diplomacy  
The U.S. has historically taken a cautious, reactive approach to military AI, often waiting for global 
consensus or regulatory frameworks before deploying advanced systems. This defensive diplomacy 
creates a strategic lag, allowing adversaries —particularly  China and Russia —to establish first -mover 
advantages in AI -driven warfare. Instead of waiting for international AI norms to emerge, the U.S. 
must set de facto military standards by deploying AI first, shaping how AI is used in warfare through 
action rathe r than diplomatic negotiation. AI policy should prioritize operational necessity over 
abstract ethical debates, recognizing that adversaries are unlikely to abide by the same constraints. 
Furthermore, the U.S. must strengthen AI coalitions with trusted NAT O and Indo -Pacific allies, 
ensuring that AI -powered military capabilities remain aligned with strategic partners rather than 
fragmented across national defense priorities.  
By adopting a modular, adaptive AI strategy, institutionalizing continuous AI iteration, achieving 
decision dominance, and shifting from defensive diplomacy to proactive leadership, the U.S. can 
ensure that AI remains a force multiplier rather than a strat egic vulnerability. The battle for AI 
superiority will not be won through deliberation alone —it will be won through decisive, forward -
looking action that defines the future of warfare before adversaries dictate its terms.

IV. The Role of Universities in AI Warfare Development  
Universities as AI R&D Incubators  
The current AI development landscape is dominated by defense contractors, whose primary focus is 
on deployment and commercialization rather than foundational research and long -term innovation. 
While companies like Anduril and Palantir excel at integrating AI into existing military platforms, 
universities provide a unique interdisciplinary advantage, combining technical research, policy 
development, and strategic analysis. Cornell, for example, brings together mechanical engineers 
advancing aerospace AI, pol itical scientists specializing in military strategy and alliances, computer 
scientists refining AI algorithms for autonomy and decision -making, and business scholars 
optimizing technology scaling and defense innovation. Unlike industry players operating wi thin 
commercial constraints, universities can explore next -generation AI capabilities, human -machine 
teaming models, and doctrinal shifts that will shape the future of AI -driven warfare.  
How Universities Can Work with DoD and Industry  
To fully leverage this expertise, the U.S. should establish a university -led AI warfighting research 
consortium in collaboration with the Department of Defense. This initiative would serve as a bridge 
between academic innovation and military applications, ensuring that cutting -edge AI research 
translates into operational capabilities. By creating an alternative to contractor -dominated AI 
development, universities can provide a broader strategic vision —one that aligns emerging AI 
technologies with evolving m ilitary needs rather than just immediate procurement demands. 
Additionally, universities are well -positioned to ensure that ethical AI discussions remain grounded 
in operational realities, rather than being dictated by abstract theoretical concerns or regu latory 
inertia. This approach would allow the U.S. to accelerate AI integration into defense systems while 
maintaining responsible oversight, ensuring that AI remains both a strategic advantage and a force 
multiplier for future conflicts.  
The Need to Secure AI Research at Universities as a National Security Asset  
As artificial intelligence becomes a decisive factor in global power competition, the United States 
must recognize AI research at universities as a strategic national security asset. However, most top -
tier AI research institutions currently lack the infras tructure, governance mechanisms, and security 
clearances necessary to handle controlled research at scale. This gap leaves critical advancements in 
AI—particularly in autonomy, cybersecurity, and decision -support systems —vulnerable to foreign 
exploitation and commercial dilution before they can be fully leveraged for national defense. To 
address this, the U.S. should establish a formal framework that enables universities to conduct AI 
research under controlled conditions, ensuring that breakthroughs with mi litary applications remain 
safeguarded. One approach is to expand the network of University Affiliated Research Centers 


6(UARCs) specializing in AI, autonomy, and warfare applications. UARCs provide a structured 
environment where universities can conduct classified or export -controlled research while 
maintaining academic independence. By designating additional AI -focused UAR Cs, the U.S. can 
ensure that universities remain central to AI innovation while enforcing the necessary security 
protocols to protect sensitive advancements. Without such a mechanism, the U.S. risks ceding 
control over AI’s most transformative military app lications, undermining both technological 
advantage and long -term strategic security.
V. Conclusion: A Call to Action
The future of warfare will be AI -driven, and the United States must dictate its trajectory rather than 
react to adversary advancements. A bold, accelerationist approach is necessary to ensure that AI is 
not just a force multiplier but a strategic enabler o f U.S. military dominance. While competitors 
move aggressively to integrate AI into battlefield operations, the U.S. must proactively shape the 
development, deployment, and governance of military AI rather than waiting for regulatory 
consensus or external pressures to force action.  
A core part of this effort is wargaming -driven AI development —using high -fidelity simulations and 
multi -agent AI systems to test, refine, and validate AI -driven battlefield decision -making before 
deployment. AI -powered wargaming provides an adaptive traini ng ground, allowing AI systems to 
learn from adversarial encounters and adjust tactics dynamically. Without this step, the U.S. risks 
deploying AI systems that are untested under real -world pressures, giving adversaries the ability to 
define the pace and s hape of AI -driven warfare.  
Cornell’s Tech Policy Institute is uniquely positioned to lead in this domain, integrating AI research, 
wargaming technology, and military strategy to develop, deploy, and scale AI -enabled warfighting 
technologies. To maintain battlefield superiority, the U.S. must not just adopt AI -driven warfare but 
actively lead its evolution —a mission that demands technological innovation, policy foresight, and 
rapid battlefield integration.
