AI work is required to further develop. AI is very helpful for our daily work and life. Many users 
even really like Deep Seek made from China with better accuracy and function. Supporting AI 
research is the right direction. not only for developing high sta ke scientific areas with AI, but 
also, basic clinical research (e..g, AI/ML algorithms for clinical decision supportive system to 
predict cancer treatment toxicity to identify high risk groups of chemotherapy side effects) for 
everyone can easily utilize t his in the clinical practice.... is very important to further be supported 
by the NIH future fund. This has been very ignored for a long time compare to many fundings to 
support AI application to help DEI. (e.g., applying AI to identify high risk of dement ia patients -
in the socially vulnerable and underserved community area etc.). Applying AI for really helping 
patients are very important ! Thank you
