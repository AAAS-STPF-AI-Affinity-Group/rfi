General Comment
Allowing AI to legally steal every piece of artwork in perpetuity will kill the entire creative industry.
First, it will m ake creating ANY kind of art unsustainable as a profession. 
Second, artists, an already difficult profession, will add to federal expenses by needing to rely governm ent benefits. 
Third, AI art will reach a singularity. With no one m aking new art, AI will only have AI art to reference, preventing any new art from  being
m ade. 
Forth, the singularly inferior art, literally singular, m ade by AI will becom e unavoidable, causing dem and to crash. The businesses will
crash. 
Finally, with AI dying after putting all artists out of business, all creative industries will die. Billions and billions of revenue lost. No culture
to export to further the colonialist causes. 
This is just laughably bad idea and one of the m ost blatant exam ples of capitalism  prom oting EXTREMELY short turn profit over any
level of viability. 
Do not give these com panies a free lunch. Make them  find ways to get their aggregators to m ake art without overt theft. Creativity is
driven by lim itations. 
Not that any of this will m atter a dam  to any conservative. AI art is the aesthetic of m odern fascism  after all.
