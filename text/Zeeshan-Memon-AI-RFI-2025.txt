Hello. I disagree with the implementation of this AI Action Plan since, as it currently stands,
the program provides far too much power in the hands of the AI sector over copyright andcommercial works that millions of Americans rely on. With this plan, AI companies gainnearly universal access to privately owned material without the need for compensation orcredit of their original creators. Our current regulations have been created to prevent scenariosexactly like this from happening. Letting a policy like this pass compromises the integrity of asystem the United States has spent literal centuries developing to protect private works.
Please consider revoking this program. Thank you.
