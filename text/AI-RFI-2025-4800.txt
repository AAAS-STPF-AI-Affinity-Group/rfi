General Comment
AI is a total sham e and shouldn’t be a focal point of Am erican businesses or governm ent. It steals the work from  others ruining their
industries all so it can output som e nonsense that is usually incorrect. AI is also a m assive energy consum er. We can’t m eet green energy
goals and power AI. The guardrails or regulations this request speaks of are necessary ans should be stricter so AI m achines can’t profit
off others without proper com pensation. AI is outright wrong and should not receive special privileges.
