General Comment
Please we are just trying to survive. I'm  a digital artist and designer. If AI is being used to do som ething like identify cancer cells in a petri
dish that's great. If artist's work is being used without their perm ission to train AI (which it has been) to m ake im ages for free so artists no
longer have to be paid, or god knows what else, that's not advancem ent. It's the enshittefication of Am erica.
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
We NEED regulations on AI. We need to m ake ethical choices. Regulations are for the protection of the Am erican public.
