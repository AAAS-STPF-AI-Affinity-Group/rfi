General Comment
Speaking as a sm all tim e illustrator, I am  concerned with the im plications of allowing AI to freely train on copyrighted m aterial. Creative
fields are very com petitive and it is already difficult for sm all businesses and individuals to control the use of their creations. It also stands
to harm  the reputation of larger com panies and their intellectual properties, the very reason entities like Disney strictly pursue legal action.
As valuable as AI m ay be as a tool, it currently seem s to be too easily capable of creating deepfakes, bootleg m erchandise, and flooding
spaces for hobbyists and professionals with low effort, rapidly churned out works. 
Encouraging this type of training stands to further dam age the creative and entertainm ent sectors and their contribution to our econom y
and culture as Am ericans.
