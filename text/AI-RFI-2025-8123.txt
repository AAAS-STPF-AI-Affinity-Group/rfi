General Comment
Allowing corporations to steal from  writers, m usicians, and film m akers m ust not happen. Just because these docum ents are being stored
and retrieved in a non-traditional way it does not m ake the use of these m aterials without renum eration a legal or fair practice.
These works are still being consum ed and reproduced by a corporation for profit. Could I download these works and use them  to teach
students? Could I download them  and sell them  to consum ers on a deck of a shuffled cards?
This is clear behavior that goes against copyright at its core for the benefit of a few corporations. It will only further im m iserete the legal
and cultural conditions of the United States. These well capitalized com panies have the funds to purchase training m aterials if they choose.
Will they be allowed to steal electricity next?
