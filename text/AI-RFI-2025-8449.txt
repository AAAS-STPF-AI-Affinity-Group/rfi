General Comment
The dom inant m ethods used by large tech com panies for training the class of attention-based neural networks that are called "large
language m odels" require the use of m assive am ounts of authentic hum an-generated text input. Many of the com panies have used
copyright m aterial without perm ission in the training of the current class of large language m odels. It would be a m istake to reward their
m assive lawbreaking with a retroactive perm ission slip - and in a rapidly changing technological environm ent, weakening copyright to
m ake AI training legal will have alm ost im m ediate unintended consequences.
The Constitution purpose of copyright is to "prom ote the progress of science and useful arts." Regulations aim ed at prom oting a currently-
popular style of developm ent of large language m odels at the cost of weakening copyright protection for all other "sciences and useful arts"
will be harm ful to the original purpose of copyright, and to everyone that creates authentic and novel works of art and science.
