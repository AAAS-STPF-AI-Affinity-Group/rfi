General Comment
AI has no place in the future of Am erica or it's people. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. Any
infringem ent upon the Am erican people's copyrights is unpatriotic. AI is over-hyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public and
contributing to energy waste. 
What m akes us Am erican is the freedom  to create what we want with our own ways, not relying upon AI. AI m ust com pensate people
for copyrighted training data, and AI-generated m aterials m ust not be copyrightable. Furtherm ore, there need to be laws lim iting hum an
"replacem ent" with AI, when that involves just expecting the rem aining hum ans to go overtim e on cleaning up the slop produced. the
current m ethods of obtaining training data are im m oral, if not downright illegal, due to legal precedent set in the past. The ecological im pact
of training AI as it currently stands consum es ridiculous am ounts of energy and, in m any cases, precious freshwater resources to cool
these training centers.
