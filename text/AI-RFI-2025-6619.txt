General Comment
I am  com m enting to say that the use of AI is not only unhelpful for future success of the United States, but it is actively harm ful. AI in its
current and proposed optim al state has not proven to help US citizens in any m eaniful way, that funding of proper resources and
departm ents wouldn't do. In fact, it has proven to be less helpful than those with basic knowledge of the subjects it pulls haphazard data
from  anyway.
This is not only considering the fact that the tech required to run AI is harm ing our enviorm ent at an alarm ing rate, that we won't have tim e
to recover and use the tech if we can't m aintain a place to live in first. AI has no place in anyone's future and giving those in charge of it
free reign will help no one.
