General Comment
I have seen several jokes on the internet about how individuals, such as college-level science m ajors, lack understanding when it com es to
the im portance of relatively basic concepts such as "sharing" and "being a good person", but to see m ultiple agencies that are (allegedly)
com posed of these exact individuals request perm ission to steal and use m aterial without the consent of either the creators or owners is
sickening, and fills m e with a sense of dread for a future of m isplaced priorities, governm ent approved theft, and a lack of security for the
average person. This "request for inform ation" is just a pretty word cover for what it actually is; a request for theft.
