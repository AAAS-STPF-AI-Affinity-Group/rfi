General Comment
I do not believe that AI has a place in the future of the United States. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an artist and a creative and has
degraded the quality of life for Am ericans across the country by stealing our work and feeding the public m isinform ation. AI is dam aging
to Am ericans and should be severely and strictly curtailed to prevent future harm , not expanded.
