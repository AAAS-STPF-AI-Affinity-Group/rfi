General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
Hello,
In recent years, there has been a well m eaning push towards Artificial Intelligence, however the recent situation has gotten out of hand and
has blown up astronom ically. Com panies and individuals do not respect the rights of others and it is uphauling to witness. I do not believe
that AI is sustainable or right for the future. It is som ething, m uch like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or any other quick grab for attention or
m oney. It will not last, and m ost abhorrently im age creation actively steals without com pensation or em otion. It cannot go on.
