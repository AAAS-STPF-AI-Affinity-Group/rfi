General Comment
I am  against this legislation. AI uses an im m ense am ount of water and energy and had m ostly been used for wasteful purposes while
stealing inform ation from  unwilling participants. AI has stolen art from  hard working individuals and has frequently provided incorrect
inform ation post search queries. I do not want m y tax $ used to fund needless use of AI. Especially when our president has been abusing
it to m ake disgusting videos such as that about Trum p Gaza hotels.
