General Comment
I firm ly believe that AI-generated content needs perm ission from  the original authors of the data it uses to train on. Without it, it would put
thousands of Am ericans out of jobs and tank the econom y. Not only that, but with how unregulated it is, its use to create illegal im agery is
widespread and ram pant. I had som eone use a photo of m e when I was a m inor and use AI to generate a nude version of it. I firm ly
believe AI does not hold a place in the future of the US.
