General Comment
Copyright is one of the few things that kept the US com petitive in the global m arket because they would be com pensated for their hard
labor by having the right to negotiate licensing and term s of use. What OpenAI, Google and other AI developers is not fair use, as they
want to turn a profit off the data they are training their m odels on. But worse, these generative m odels are intended to undercut the
creative industries and hinder any true innovation as GenAI cannot create anything new. The US will fall behind and m ost consum ers
looking for creative and innovating m edia will look outside of the US. The creatives that sustained our dom estic industry will be unable to
m ake ends m eet and no longer have the incentive to produce new classics. Anim ation and video gam es, our m ost profitable exports, will
go the way of m anufacturing. For the good of the citizens, and not the corporations, copyrights m ust be m aintained, and should the AI
developers need m ore data, they should pay citizens what they are owed for their labor.
