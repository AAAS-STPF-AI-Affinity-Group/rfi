General Comment
Copyright law aside, the Fifth Am endm ent ends with "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just com pensation."
Allowing any com pany, Big Tech or otherwise, to be given access to loopholes to steal m aterial in order to train their AI goes against the
foundations of our governm ent. Additionally, allowing com panies to essentially destroy copyright protections opens them  up to other
countries, com panies, and people stealing said com panies' content under the guise of training their own AI program s. 
While I am  not against AI, I am  against training it without perm ission and com pensation to the original content owners. Nothing in this
plan/EO as currently presented suggests that these will be required or enforced. This plan should be tabled until these two item s have been
addressed and suggestions have been taken from  people who work in copyright law, tech, and security, and who are not com pany CEOs
looking to m ake m oney off of property theft.
