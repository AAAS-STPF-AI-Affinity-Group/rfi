A FEW MORE THINGS I FORGOT TO ADD TO MY STATEMENT! SURE AI IS A 
HELPFUL TOOL, BUT IT SHOULD ONLY BE A TOOL, NOT SOMETHING THAT 
CONTROLS! USE AI IN SITUATIONS TOO DANGEROUS FOR HUMAN LIFE, OR TO 
BUILD STRUCTURES FASTER FOR VICTIMS OF FLOODS OR FIRES! USE AI  TO 
EXPLORE UNKNOWN PLACES. DO NOT USE AI TO REPLACE HUMAN THINKING, 
REASONING, AND EXPERIENCE BECAUSE WITH AGE, AND EXPERIENCE COMES A 
WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PROBLEM SOLVING THAT AI CAN NEVER 
EXPERIENCE!! HERE IS THE DEAL, NO MORE CENTRAL BANKING! PERI OD!! I AM 
PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF PAYING MY BILLS ON TIME, AND DOING WHATEVER 
TRANSACTIONS NEED TO BE DONE WITH NO SUPERVISION. USE BANK 
MANAGERS AS ADVISORS, MAYBE? I DO NOT NEED LOANS, OR CREDIT, IF I 
PURCHASE A CAR, IT WILL BE A CASH CAR I BUY OUTRIGHT WIT H NO PAYMENTS 
AND THAT WILL BE THE END OF IT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM NOW WHICH IS SET UP 
ON MONTHLY PAYMENTS IS A BUNCH OF BS! YOU KNOW DANG WELL THE 
DEALERSHIPS DID NOT PAY $30, 000.00 For A USED CAR!! CAR DEALERSHIPS ARE 
REALLY CORRUPT! FIX THIS! ALSO, THE HO USES FOR $60,000.00 WITH FLOORS 
FALLING APART AND ROOFS MISSING IS A BUNCH OF BS!! A DECENT PLACE TO 
LIVE SHOULD NOT COST $400,000.00!!! PERIOD!! FIX IT!! THE TINY ONE BEDROOM 
APARTMENT I LIVE IN SHOULD NOT BE RAISING MY RENT EVERY TIME I SIGN 
THE DANG LEA SE! PERIOD! MY RENT RIGHT NOW IS $660.00 A MONTH! IT WILL 
PROBABLY GO UP TO $700.00 THIS FALL! I AM 67 YEARS OLD, I WORK PART -TIME. 
THIS IS THE CHEAPEST APARTMENT IN MY TOWN! MANAGEMENT COMPANIES 
MONOPOLIZE THIS SITUATION! FIX IT!! THE COMPANY I WORK FOR H AS NOW 
REFUSED ANYONE OVER -TIME! THAT MEANS MY CO -WORKERS WITH HOUSE 
PAYMENTS, CAR PAYMENTS, NEW BABIES, SICK BABIES AND OTHER SITUATIONS 
ARE REALLY HURTING BECAUSE THEY NEED THAT OVER -TIME PAY TO SURVIVE! 
CORPORATE AMERICA IS HORRIBLE! THIS COMPANY OWNS 7 00 STORES OR 
MORE, IF THEY CANNOT AFFORD OVER -TIME, THEN THEY NEED TO SELL A FEW 
STORES! GREED! THEY ARE OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY, NO EXCEPTIONS, DO NOT 
EVEN CLOSE FOR CHRISTMAS! OK, IF THEY SHUT DOWN 3RD SHIFT, THEY COULD 
AFFORD TO PAY WORKERS WHAT THEY DESERV E TO MAKE INSTEAD OF GIVING 
THEM A .13 CENT RAISE!! WHAT AN INSULT! THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE REALLY 
STRUGGLING! THIS HUGE COMPANY COULD SHUT DOWN 3RD SHIFT, FIX THE 
GAS PUMPS SO THAT NO ONE HAD TO BE THERE FOR FOR FOLKS TO GET 
GASOLINE AND SAVE MONEY ON THE ELECTRIC BILL AND WORKER PAY FOR 
THAT OVER -NIGHT SHIFT AND NOT LOSE MONEY!! FIX THIS MESS OF 
MONOPOLIZING! THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS --IF YOU TRULY WANT TO MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN --STOP THESE HUGE MONOPOLIZING COMPANIES! 
PERIOD!! CHARGE THEM TARRIFFS FOR HAV ING A CHAIN OF 300 STORES OR 
MORE! DO SOMETHING! CHARGE THEM TARRIFFS FOR HAVING 30 APARTMENT 
COMPLEXES RUN BY THE SAME MANAGEMENT IN ONE TOWN! DO SOMETHING! 
USE THESE EMPTY BUILDINGS ALL OVER TOWN FOR HUMANITARIAN PROJECTS 


TO HELP THE ACTUAL "HOMELESS PEOPLE" NOT THE ONES WHO STAND ON A 
CORNER BEGGING AND DO IT FOR A "LIVING" WHEN THEY DRIVE A NICER CAR 
AND WEAR NICER CLOTHES THAN I DO! THERE ARE POEPLE WHO CLAIM TO BE 
HOMELESS, YET REFUSE JOBS, REFUSE ANY PERMANENT SOLUTION S! THEY ARE 
SCAMMERS, PERIOD! TRUE HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO WANT HELP WOULD 
GLADLY ACCEPT WORK IF ALLOWED TO SLEEP IN A STORAGE ROOM OR 
SOMETHING UNTIL THEY COULD AFFORD A PLACE TO LIVE --SOME OF THESE 
"STREET CORNER HOMELESS PEOPLE" ARE SCAMMERS WHO DEPEND ON T HE 
SYMPATHY OF WORKING PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THEM! THIS NEEDS TO STOP!! LET 
THE "HOMELESS" FIX ROADS, OR WORK IN COMMUNITY GARDENS OR 
SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE FOR A PLACE TO LIVE TO BEGIN WITH UNTIL THEY 
CAN AFFORD ONE! I WORK AT 67 YEARS OLD, IF THEY CAN STAND O N A CORNER 
ALL DAY AND BEG FOR MONEY ALL DAY, THEN THEY CAN WORK AS WELL! 
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE CHOOSE TO LIVE LIKE THIS AND YOU CANNOT HELP 
THEM IF THEY WILL NOT MAKE CHANGES IN DECISIONS! AMERICA HAS BECOME 
A HUGE CONGLOMERATE OF CORPORATIONS! IF YOU REAL LY WANT TO MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, BRING BACK THE MOM AND POP STORES, THE SMALL 
BUSINESSES THAT THIS COUNTRY GREW FROM! HELP FARM PEOPLE SELL THEIR 
PRODUCE, MILK, AND EGGS OUTSIDE THE HUGE GROCERY STORE CHAINS! STOP 
"PROCESSING" ALL THE VITAMINS AND GOOD  NUTRITION FROM FOOD! HELP 
THEM HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE STORES WHERE PEOPLE CAN WORK FOR THEM 
AND EARN FOOD FOR WORK OR SOMETHING! UNITE PEOPLE! WHEN WE WORK 
TOGETHER TO HELP EACH OTHER, MONEY BECOMES LESS IMPORTANT THAN 
HUMANS! IT IS TIME TO DO THAT NOW!! I NSTEAD OF THROWING A PERFECTLY 
GOOD ITEM AWAY, TRADE IT FOR SOMETHING YOU NEED, NO MONEY 
EXCHANGED! MONEY SHOULD NOT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE 
WORLD! PEOPLE SHOULD BE! TRADE PRODUCTS FOR SERVICES, OR PRODUCTS 
FOR OTHER PRODUCTS! HELP PEOPLE SET UP  STORES WHERE PEOPLE TRADE 
ITEMS NOT NEEDED FOR ITEMS NEEDED NO MONEY EXCHANGED! MAYBE WORK 
FOR THE STORE FOR ITEMS OR FOR A ROOM TO LIVE IN! HELP PEOPLE, HELP 
OTHER PEOPLE! IT IS TIME FOR CHANGE!
