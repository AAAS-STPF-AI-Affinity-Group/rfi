General Comment
As an ordained clergy person, m y livelihood depends on using words to bring com fort, challenge, hope, and understanding to a variety of
people from  different backgrounds and experiences. The guardrails of copyright law allow these words to be tailored to the com m unity
that desires to hear them . Allowing A.I. com panies to learn from  m y words without learning the context those words were spoken in
would create an A.I. m odel that thinks it knows m ore than it does. Plus it would violate the religious liberties of the congregation that has
called m e to serve it. A.I. m odels should have to follow the sam e copyright law as everyone else. If it doesn't have the intelligence to do
that, then it's m issing half of what its trying to be.
