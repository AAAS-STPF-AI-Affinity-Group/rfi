General Comment
AI is overhyped garbage built on theft of actual work. It is stealing livelihoods, decim ating our water supply, and ruining any quality
inform ation that was previously available via search engines. It is invading every aspect of our lives where it is not wanted. Even calling it
Artificial Intelligence is a lit to the Am erican public. It is nothing but a crappy algorithm  built on theft. It will destroy anything of quality that
it touches. We should purge it from  society.
