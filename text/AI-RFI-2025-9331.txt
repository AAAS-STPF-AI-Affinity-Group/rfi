General Comment
Given the excessive resource dem ands required to run LLMs and the real risk of an AI bubble, based on every single developer actually
losing m oney on system s like OpenAI, ChatGPT, GROK, etc., an excessive rush to rem ove guardrails on developm ent of AI is both
dangerous and financially unsound. That one of the prim ary dem ands that the com panies developing these AI program s is that they should
have unfettered access to copyrighted works they HAVE NOT PAID FOR should give everyone pause, as any product or service that
relies on the theft of other people's work is not som ething the Am erican people should be supporting. There are benefits to careful and
sensible developm ent of LLMs, but not at the expense of the law or of the rights of artists and writers.
