I am writing as a private individual and a creator of written and podcast IP to leave a comment on the AI Action
Plan.
The AI dominance the United States is pursuing is a pipe dream. Although generative AI has some uses in scientific
contexts, the creation of large language models using personal IP is not only a violation of my property and privacyrights, but an insult to the creative efforts I put into my work, and under no circumstances should AI companies beallowed freedom from copyright law on the off chance that AI is actually useful in five years, or even one year. Donot let generative AI have unfettered access to the things I’ve written with my own mind and heart. Do not letcompanies flout copyright law, a legal protection, for a purely speculative “greater good.”
