General Comment
AI is the enem y of innovation. True innovation is borne from  people. What a disincentive to creating, knowing their intellectual property
has no protection from  large corporations sweeping it up en m asse to feed to their plagiarism  m achines! AI hurts Am erican creators--
m yself included--and by extension all Am ericans.
Public interest in AI peaked. The industry is dying. Money thrown into it is com pletely wasted. Allowing this circum vention of intellectual
property rights only lets a dying beast flail longer, dam aging other industries and individuals in its death throes.
There are so m any other ways in which Am erica can and should be encouraged to prosper, to innovate, to shine. This is not one of them .
Let us be known for our creativity, or ingenuity, our business acum en, not a need to steal to m ake even substandard, lifeless, inaccurate
works, whether in art, journalism , com puter science, psychology, or m any others.
We are better than petty thieves. This is not the beacon to light for our country. It will only stifle innovation, weaken us, and lessen our
standing in the world.
