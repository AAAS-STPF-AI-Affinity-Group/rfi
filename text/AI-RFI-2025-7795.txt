General Comment
giant com panies like OpenAI should not be allowed to steal other works to inform  their product. If they are believers in the "open m arket"
then they should pay for the use of copyrighted m aterial to train their AI. it is despicable that they are stealing all of the m aterial and then
repurposing as a paid product for their own com pany.
