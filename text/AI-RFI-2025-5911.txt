General Comment
AI has already stolen m illions upon m illions of copyrighted im ages for years. It's stagnation is a sign that it has reached its lim it, and
allowing com panies to m ake 1/1 copies of things and labeling them  as AI Generated would set an unpredictable scale of destruction
across m edia com panies.
