General Comment
If your goal is to "secure a brighter future for all Am ericans" this isn't the way to do it. I, as well as m any others, do not consent to having
everything I post online scraped for AI training. I am  an artist by trade, and m y livelihood and ability to obtain and sustain gainful
em ploym ent is being jeopardized by the rise of AI being used by com panies in place of hum ans to do creative work. I do not want private
com panies to be able to steal m y intellectual property without consequence.
