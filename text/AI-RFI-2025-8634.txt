General Comment
Frankly it is ridiculous that us artists keep having to defend our intellectual property tim e and tim e again. No, com panies should not be
able to train their AI on our work. They are already stealing our work they should not be given m ore power to steal even m ore of our
hard earned hum an-m ade art. This im pacts sm all businesses across the United States that m ake actual art to sell or prom ote their
business. This im pacts individuals and the drive people feel to m ake things. If com panies want art, they can pay for it to be m ade by real
hum an hands.
