General Comment
This is a terrible idea that only serves to benefit the owners of " generative AI" (actually LLM/Large Learning Machine) com panies. It is
largely known generative AIs have an inaccuracy rate of over 60%, with all m odels largely inventing inform ation. This increases the spread
of m isinform ation. In addition, these system s largely require the use of inform ation, including copyrighted m aterial and/or CSAM. Keep
current AI laws as they are.
