General Comment
Do not allow Generative AI to train off of actual people without their consent, it will create an ecosystem  that is vastly m ore unhealthy for
those both creating and consum ing content. It m akes it harder for real people to m ake a living in alr4eady harsh tim es, and can likely be
used to create m ore convincing scam s to pull consum ers into, funneling m oney into places that only serve to hinder us further.
As a creative m yself, Generative AI has m ade m y life notably m ore stressful on top of everything else. It's relatively unhindered spread into
as m any places as it has has brought down the quality of gathering inform ation and factual references to things harder, m ost of everything is
getting filled with spam  from  all of these "tools".
It is going to swallow the internet whole if allowed to continue like this unchecked, rendering it near useless before cannibalizing itself. And
I would deeply prefer not to see this happen in m y lifetim e, or the lifetim es of those after m e.
