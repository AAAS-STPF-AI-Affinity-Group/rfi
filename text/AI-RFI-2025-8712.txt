General Comment
AI developm ent should be lim ited to private and public dom ain datasets only. The use of copyrighted m aterials without perm ission and
without legal recourse by the copyright holder stifles innovations and protections for inventors, artists and other corporations. To allow AI
developers to use copyrighted m aterials without specific negotiated paym ent to the owners of said copyright is an affront to capitalism  and
the am erican way of life.
