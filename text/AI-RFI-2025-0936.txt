General Comment
Thank you for allowing this inform ation from  the Citizens of the USA. My com m ent deals with disclosure of data provided and the request
that all contributing to the training of AI, be archived for references and the security of all. It is im portant to know where inform ation or
resources are located if this inform ation is capable of affecting m any and the outcom es for decisions. Audit trails should be kept and
accurate. Individuals contributing inform ation to AI m ust be qualified and not relying on assum ptions. There should be levels of inform ation
provided based on the urgency and reason for needing answers from  AI. A person should not be in fear of losing a job etc. due to the
assum ptions or undocum ented facts obtained from  AI. Responsibility and accountability are a necessity. If crim es are com m itted based on
inform ation provided by AI, there should be thorough investigation into who is responsible. Legal fines or in necessary im prisonm ent m ay
be necessary. AI should inform  at all tim es if it is recording inform ation and storing personal inform ation. Consent should be given for AI
to listen in or record a person or have access to written docum entation. Photos, conversations and tim ing used to tape should be agreed
on prior to AI m oving forward. A person should be allowed to hear anything which has been recorded and have the option to delete
personal inform ation. This should be done at the discretion of the person who has been recorded without consent.
