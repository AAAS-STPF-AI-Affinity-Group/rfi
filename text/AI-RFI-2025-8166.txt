General Comment
Generative AI is a destructive force, a grift with alm ost no beneficial use cases that is being forced upon the world by a handful of people
hoping to profit off of a com bination theft and having to pay fewer workers. Giving OpenAI any special protections is a betrayal of the
Am erican people, and an insult to anyone who has ever created anything original.
