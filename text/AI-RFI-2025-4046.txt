General Comment
Do not allow these AI ghouls to steal art legally. Allowing them  to do so is anti-art, anti-hum an, and opens doors for m uch m ore. It's a
negative for all of hum anity on such a m assive level and to perm it this is to stray further from  a utopia that should be the goal of all
hum anity.
