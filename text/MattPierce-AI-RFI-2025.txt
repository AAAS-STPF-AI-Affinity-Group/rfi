To whom it may concern, 
AI models that require the unauthorised plundering of copyrighted material are a bald-faced
attempt to undercut hard working americans and replace them with machines that not only donot understand, but are designed to believably lie. The american people are being forced to interact with this technology at every turn. I don'tknow anyone who understands the tech that does not hate it. myself included. I do not giveconsent for these machines and the unscrupulous men who run them to rape my life's work.
It's a cataclysmic waste of resources, money, and everyone's time.
