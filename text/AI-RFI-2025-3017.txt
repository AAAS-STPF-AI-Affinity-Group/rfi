General Comment
I express m y disagreem ent and disgust as a proud free hum an being. I am  not willing to give in m y lifestyle and creations to a m achine. If
you, the people behind this action plan, have com m on sense, you could reject and dispose this proposal so the people of your country,
from  this planet, from  this existence.
I firm ly ask for the step back from  this. Or else, the people will com e for you once they see their freedom  is lost
