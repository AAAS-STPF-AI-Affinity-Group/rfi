General Comment
Why should OpenAI get a free pass to scrape and use copyrighted m aterials as training data when in any other production process this is
called theft? If som e sort of rem uneration and protections are not extended to those producing the training data, we will see the end of arts
and culture as we know it. Good bye entry level positions in copywriting, graphic design, m usic production and so forth, positions that
artists rely on when starting their careers. We need to find m odels to protect and em power those creating culture and this m eans not letting
OpenAI take what they like from  the internet without having to disclose this, honor copyright, adequately rem unerate and credit artists.
Regulate them . Protect the people who are actually m aking culture.
