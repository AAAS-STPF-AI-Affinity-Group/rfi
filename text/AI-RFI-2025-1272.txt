General Comment
Generative AI such as OpenAI, MidJourney, or any other AI m odel that steals and copies m aterial for AI training is theft. Prom oting and
protecting such technologies does not help or support the Am erican people, but in fact steals property and jobs from  both Am ericans and
people around the world.
Other AI technologies utilized in m edical research and other developm ental fields do have applications, allowing the com pilation and
processing of large am ounts of data.
Generative AI has NO practical or beneficial use, and should not benefit from  being allowed to freely steal copyrighted content for
training, nor allowed to steal jobs from  artists, actors, and other creative and talented people.
Strong opposition for and prom otion or protections for Generative AI technologies.
