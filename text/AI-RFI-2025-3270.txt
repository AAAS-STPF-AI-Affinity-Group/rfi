General Comment
I believe this "venture into the future" holds no value to the people, and only seeks to harm  everyone. "Artificial Intelligence" has been
overly hyped up as som e deus ex m achina that knows everything, when this is not the case. It only serves to steal from  the people, to
splice and sew their words and im ages into im practical im itations of them . As an artist m yself, I find the idea that the people who
spearhead this sim ple pattern recognition software will be given free reign to steal whatever they want to create a software that will only
steal even m ore. 
This is a m achine that profits from  the theft of the Am erican people. This will only serve to provoke yet m ore strife and pain in the people.
Please do not go through with this.
