General Comment
I am  a Canadian citizen who posts words and im ages on the internet. OpenAI has alm ost certainly illegally scraped m y data before. What
this request by the thieves in question is for would jeopardize m y personal use of the internet and any other international user. Which
m eans that if it goes through, m y only recourse would be to go to m y governm ent and get international sanctions, lawsuits, and other
restrictions put on the US for their illegal and active prom otion of theft.
AI is deeply anti-hum an at its core. It is m orally bankrupt. All uses are wrong and all prom otion is based on theft.
