General Comment
I am  a writer and AI has dem olished m y livelihood. Everyone has cut their writing budgets because AI is cheap or free. To add insult to
injury, AI com panies scrape words I HAVE WRITTEN to create a product that steals business FROM ME. I, without consent, have
been com plicit in the decline of m y own work. AI rapes us all so com panies can profit. We cannot m ake this even easier for them !!
