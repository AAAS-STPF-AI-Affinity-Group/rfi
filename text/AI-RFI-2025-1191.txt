General Comment
My nam e is Perry Velisaris and I am  a 2nd sem ester senior at Avonworth High School. I studied generative AI and its im pact on Physical
Therapy for two m onths in a course on AI and Ethics this year. From  m y research, I think this current adm inistration's viewpoint on AI
regulation is going up. They say that “excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transform ative industry just as it’s taking off and we
m ake every effort to encourage pro-growth AI policies” The governm ent is not trying to stop AI from  growing at all, they are actually
prom oting AI in businesses, and for other countries to use Am erican AI. In the Physical Therapy field, the devices that help with
screenings, and patients that can’t m ake it into clinics like the devices FOTO(Focus On Therapeutic Outcom es), and SWORD are just
two devices that will help change how Physical Therapy is done for the better. FOTO is a m achine that does patient analysis screens to
help the PTs see what's wrong with the patients’ bodies. Before this was m ade, it would be hard for PTs to m ake precise calls on what
was wrong because they couldn’t actually see inside the body. SWORD is a device that patients use at hom e which helps with them  not
being able to m ake it into the clinic for whatever reason that is. What this does is has a PT m ake a program  for the patient to do at hom e.
It records the patient and gives feedback when a patient is doing it wrong. It can also change a workout depending on how the patient is
feeling.
