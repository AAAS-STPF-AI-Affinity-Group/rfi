General Comment
The United States has a thriving arts com m unity, and especially in the film  industry's case, is one of our greatest exports in term s of m oney
and culture. These artists creating things in our country deserve protections from  AI stealing and using their work.
It's worth noting that the LLM AI industry only m akes m oney on the notoriously fickle stock m arket, and has generated far, far less
m oney on its own due to the im m ense operating costs of each request. In other words, it's a losing bet, and som eday soon, I believe this
will becom e clear.
Lastly, it's always easy to tell when art was generated by AI, and whenever I m ake that determ ination from  an ad, I think the com pany
using it is trashy for not sim ply paying an artist.
