General Comment
AI has been grossly m isused. AI has a place but not in the generative field. It should not be used to generate as AI has no proper ability to
say what is right and what is wrong as that is purely an organic m indset. Preserve copyrights in their full form , because without those
protections, all writing is vulnerable, including everything that the President has “written.” AI is a tool, but as we have seen, it has been
abused as a tool to steal for those who are lazy and m orally deprived.
