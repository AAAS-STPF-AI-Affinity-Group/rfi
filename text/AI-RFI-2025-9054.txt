General Comment
I'm  deeply concerned that current generative m odels have the potential to dissem inate copyrighted m aterial, including intellectual property
such as artwork, literature, patents, and algorithm s, in violation of United States copyright and intellectual property laws. This underm ines
the intellectual property rights of organizations and individuals and the com petitiveness of Am erican science and industry by encouraging
theft of IP and other rent-seeking behaviors. I strongly encourage legislation aim ed at aligning LLMs and generators with United States
copyright and intellectual property laws.
