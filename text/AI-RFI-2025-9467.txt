General Comment
Claim s that the rate of AI developm ent is a national security concern – and that OpenAI’s requests are an appropriate approach – need
to be taken with extrem e scrutiny. The purported benifits of AI (specifically AGI) for hum an prosperity and its econom ic profitibility are
dubious, based m ore on speculative outcom es than its current practical im plem entations. If nothing else, DeepSeek’s ability to com pete
with OpenAI using significantly less energy in m odel developing should put into question whether access to copyrighted works is truly
nescessary, or if OpenAI is reliant on convenient solutions.
