General Comment
I am  against allowing OpenAI and AI Com panies as a whole to take copyrighted m aterial for the sake of training their system s. I think the
blatant theft of artist's work for the sake of what is ultim ately a gim m ick is appalling.
It is frankly ridiculous that this is even being entertained. If these com panies wish to train their system s they absolutely m ust go through the
sam e channels as anybody else to have access to it PROPERLY. All OpenAI has proven that if they can't have free reign to take
whatever they want, they can no longer function as a com pany. What business structure is sustainable that they need to steal in order to
survive? That is just a failure of a business.
Please reconsider allowing OpenAI and other AI com panies access to copyrighted freely as this will have very real and lasting
repercussions on not just creativity of the Am erican people but of our country itself. I can't genuinely think anybody would ever allow
work with our country if we allow com panies to steal their IPs to feed what is essentially a gim m ick that can be abused m aliciously.
