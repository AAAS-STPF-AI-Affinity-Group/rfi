General Comment
All currently so-called "AI" com panies in Am erica rely on stealing the intellectual property of patriotic, hard-working am ericans to fuel
their woke agenda.
The top priority for the adm inistration and anyone else should be forcing so-called "AI" com panies to play by the sam e copyright rules as
everyone else, including paying appropriate fees, using appropriate services, and otherwise adequately com pensating those whose data
they have previously been stealing and m alpurposely appropriating. If they can't afford to do that, they should go out of business so
Am erica First com panies can step up to the plate with a fairer deal instead.
