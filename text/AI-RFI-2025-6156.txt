General Comment
I'm  not terribly surprised that the adm inistration that has em powered an unelected billionaire to steal our country's m oney and data are
pushing to allow AI to do the sam e. Maybe they should try doing som ething to benefit people rather than exploit them . Revolutionary idea,
I know.
