Removing limitations on copyright law will only serve to benefit companies producing AI
content, and it will do so by removing the value of current intellectual property.Removing
 the value from intellectual property will consequently remove the value from their
associated industries, and this will affect any creative medium and industry, such industriesinclude but are not limited to Writing, Music, Film, Art, and Video Games among others.
These industries carry huge cultural significance, generate millions of dollars in profit
annually, and thus contribute a significant amount to the economy both nationally andinternationally.Reducing the value of these industries will also reduce that contribution, and will impact theeconomy negatively.
Furthermore you can expect to face negative
 backlash and potential legal action from any
large corporations that exist in these industries, as you would be directly attacking their
profits.
 A pertinent example of this would be Disney, as Disney has historically been an advocate for
leveraging copyright to protect their intellectual properties such as Mickey Mouse and Winniethe Pooh.
From a human perspective removal of copyright limitations would be harmful as the resulting
damage to these industries would cause the people working in those industries to lose theirjobs.The companies affected would make their employees redundant to try and stay afloat,therefore without an income to support themselves and their families they would not be able tocontribute to the economy either.This would directly impact independent creatives as well, removing their financialcontribution to the economy as you destroy their livelihoods.Finally there is a moral argument to be made that since AI cannot create anything original andonly iterates on existing properties, what AI makes cannot be considered art, or anything ofvalue, it is simply slop that contributes nothing to human culture and leaves our society worseoff as genuine art is buried among the valueless e-waste produced by soulless programs.
 
In conclusion, removing copyright restrictions would only benefit the companies producing AIand would negatively impact existing highly lucrative industries, this would have negativeconsequences for the economy and society that would far outweigh any meager benefits.
Kind regards,
