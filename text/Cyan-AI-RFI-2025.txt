Giving AI companies free use of copyrighted material is fundamentally wrong
as it completely undermines the idea of copyright.
Copyright is automatically granted to the author of an original work.
And  allowing a private party  to profit from the work of the original
author without their consent is  completely wrong.
AI steals from the livelihood of Americans and profits off of theft
