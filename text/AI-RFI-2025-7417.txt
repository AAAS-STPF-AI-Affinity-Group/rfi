General Comment
I am  a writer and it is im portant for m e to state that AI does NOT hold any place in the future of the United States. Program s like
ChatGPT and Dall-E (and entities such as OpenAI) engage in ram pant theft of copyrighted m aterial in order to operate. Allowing such
entities to continue this abuse that affects m y livelihood and the livelihoods of countless other artists is unconscionable. And to m ake such
entities im m une from  prosecution or recom pense will have countless disastrous effects for the country.
