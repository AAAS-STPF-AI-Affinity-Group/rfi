General Comment
This is extrem ely dangerous and quite ridiculous to allow a com pany to com pletely disregard copyright law. Open AI scraped the entire
internet to build a m achine that is wrong 60% of the tim e. Threatens to replace hum an works using stolen work. It m ust not be allowed to
hum iliate the US governm ent and destroy copyright for all of the hum an and corporate work and data on the internet. Not to m ention the
environm ental dam age.
