To Whom it May Concern,
As a digital content creator specializing in online recipe publishing, I appreciate the
opportunity to provide input on the development of the AI Action Plan. While AI presentsexciting opportunities for innovation, I urge policymakers to consider its impact onindependent creators, particularly in the areas of intellectual property rights, contentattribution, and search engine visibility.
1. Intellectual Property Protection for Online Content
AI models frequently train on publicly available content, including recipe websites, blogs, anddigital publications. Weakening copyright protections could lead to AI-generated contentreplicating original work without proper attribution or compensation to the creators.Policymakers should ensure:
Stronger enforcement mechanisms against unauthorized content scraping.
Clear regulations requiring AI companies to obtain permission before using copyrightedmaterial for model training.
2. AI’s Impact on Search Visibility for Independent Creators
Search engines, including Google, increasingly feature AI-generated summaries at the top ofresults, reducing traffic to original content sources. This disproportionately affects smallcreators who rely on organic search traffic for revenue. I recommend:
That AI-generated search snippets have clear attribution and direct links to the sourcesit's pulling from.
Policies ensuring that AI-generated results do not unfairly replace or suppress organicsearch rankings for independent publishers.
3. Ethical AI Development and Content Attribution
AI-generated content should adhere to ethical content attribution practices. If AI systemsderive inspiration or direct information from specific sources, those sources should becredited, similar to how academic citations function. I encourage:
Development of AI attribution standards, ensuring that digital content creators receiverecognition when their work informs AI outputs.
Implementation of an opt-out mechanism for creators who do not wish to have theircontent used for AI training.


By addressing these concerns, the AI Action Plan can balance technological advancement with
fair treatment of the creators who contribute to the internet’s wealth of knowledge. I
appreciate your consideration and look forward to policies that support both AI innovation andindependent content creators.
Best,Dorothy Kern
