AI Action Plan for Reviewing the Investments & Financial Gains of Elected Officials for 
Potential Conflicts of Interest  
 
1. Objectives & Use Cases  
 
The objective of this AI Action Plan  is to enhance financial transparency and accountability  by 
using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect potential conflicts of interest, insider trading, and 
financial corruption  among elected officials and their immediate family members. AI can 
analyze financial disclosures, investment trends, and wealth accumulation during and after their 
tenure in office.  
 
Key AI Use Cases:  
• Insider Trading Detection  – AI cross-referencing stock trades of elected officials and family 
members with legislative activities and privileged information access.  
• Wealth Accumulation Analysis  – AI tracking net worth increases of politicians during and 
immediately after their time in office.  
• Investment Conflict Identification  – AI identifying financial interests in companies affected by 
policies, regulations, or contracts they influenced.  
• Book, Speech & Publication Revenue Analysis  – AI reviewing bulk purchases, corporate 
sponsorships, or foreign purchases of books, speeches, and media appearances.  
• Campaign Donation & Lobbyist Influence Analysis  – AI detecting patterns where campaign 
donors benefit from government contracts or policy decisions.  
• Financial Disclosure Verification  – AI ensuring compliance with mandatory reporting of assets, 
investments, and income sources.  
• Government Contract Influence Tracking  – AI linking government contracts awarded to 
companies with financial ties to elected officials.

regulations.  
9. Monitoring & Optimization  
• Define AI performance KPIs  (e.g., detection accuracy, fraud case resolution rates).  
• Deploy AI -driven financial oversight dashboards  for real-time monitoring.  
• Continuously refine AI models  based on historical fraud cases and new financial trends.  
10. Change Management & Adoption  
• Engage financial regulators, ethics committees, and watchdog organizations  for AI 
implementation.  
• Develop bipartisan oversight frameworks  to ensure non -partisan AI financial monitoring.  
• Launch public transparency initiatives  to enhance trust in AI -driven government ethics 
enforcement.
