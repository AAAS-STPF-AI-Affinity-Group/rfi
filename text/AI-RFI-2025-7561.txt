General Comment
I am  a concerned citizen concerning the blatant illegal m isuse of proprietary copyrighted m aterials being used to develop AI technologies. I
am  an individual artist who uses m y skill to create unique products and services. 
I am  fervently OPPOSED to allowing AI com panies and projects to be allowed to be trained on copyrighted m aterials. It is blatant theft
no m atter how you dress it up. 
Continued use of AI, generative and otherwise, only serve to dum b down the public and strip our great nation of its ability to create. It
only serves to halt progress.
Our nation dies with AI investm ent.
Thank you 
-Seth Jensen
