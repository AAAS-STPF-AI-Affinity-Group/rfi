My name is Cassidy Johncour, and I am a 2nd-semester senior at Avonworth High School. I 
studied generative AI and its impact on theology for two months in a course on AI and Ethics this year. From my research, I think this current administration's viewpoint on AI regulation is risky. Taking down barriers and lowering regulations to have U.S. dominance in 
AI may not be beneﬁcial. AI inﬁltrates more of our country every day, and reducing 
regulations wi ll only increase its dominance over us, not the other way around. What I 
mean by this is not AI itself controlling us but others who wrongfully use it. Sometimes, people don’t even know the damage they can cause, especially through the loss of jobs. AI has entered every aspect of people’s lives, including their faith. A particular but worrisome 
human replacement was Pepper the robot, taking the role of a human priest. Pepper has spoken at funerals and at crowds. Another consideration would be writers; they are no longer a necessity. Alexandra Kirsch works for Salesforce and was a guest speaker in my AI and Ethics course. She is a writer for the company and stated that she felt as if she were “training her replacement” when exposed to AI. She tries to refrain from the use of artiﬁcial 
intelligence because it lessens her creativity in her writing, although she said she is certain AI will take her job one day. Conclusively, I disagree with the administration's current viewpoint on AI regulation.
