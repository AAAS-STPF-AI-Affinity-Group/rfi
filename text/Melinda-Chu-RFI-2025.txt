models tailored for government use. Unlike GitHub, it will include security compliance 
frameworks  (NIST,  FedRAMP)  and standardized  documentation,  allowing  agencies  to integrate 
AI models without redundant validation efforts. Launching by 2027 with 100+ AI models, it will 
be scalable from $5M to $100M, allowing it to be initiated  as a pilot project (with 10 models) or 
as a large scale initiative.  NSF  PRIORITY  INITIATIVES  
1. MODEL  DEVELOPMENT  AND  OPEN SOURCE  
The lack of standardized, open -source AI models hinders AI research and adoption in federally 
funded projects. Without a centralized repository, researchers, startups, and academic 
institutions face barriers to accessing secure, government -compliant AI models. Proprietary 
models dominate the private sector, limiting opportunities for collaborative AI development, 
reproducibility, and public -sector innovation. NSF -funded researchers must individually 
validate AI models for compliance (e.g., NIST, FedRAMP),  leading  to inefficiencies,  redundant  
approvals,  and slower  AI integration  into research and federal applications.  
 
Goal  
By funding  open -source  AI model  development  and compliance  frameworks,  this initiative 
will: 
- Reduce  research  costs  by eliminating redundant  security  and compliance  work.  
- Ensure  AI model  reproducibility  for scientific  integrity  and innovation.  
- Expand  access  to trusted  AI tools  across  NSF,  NIH,  DOE,  and other  research - driven 
agencies.  
 
Near-Term  Initiative:  ~$100M  Open -Source  AI Development  Bounties  (2026 -2030, Scalable 
to $200M)  
 
 
2. AI LICENSING  & REGULATIONS  FOR STARTUPS , CORPORATIONS  & DATA 
(aka  Making  Technical  and Safety  Standards  Easy  to Implement  for Government Contracts 
and Projects)  
Key Issues: The private sector, particularly startups and individual researchers, faces significant 
hurdles in aligning AI innovations with stringent government technical and safety standards, 
such as NIST 800 -53 or FedRAMP, which are often costly and complex to implement. These 
compliance burdens —requiring extensive cybersecurity measures, documentation, and 
auditing —disproportionately disadvantage smaller entities lacking resources, limiting their 
ability to collaborate with federal agencies like NSF or deploy AI tools for government use. This 
stifles innovation, as promising research projects or innovative experimental R&D struggle to 
meet procurement or security thresholds, delaying their integration into critical systems. 
Moreover, inconsistent standards across agencies exacerbate the challenge, creating a 
fragmented  landscape  that hinders  scalability  and adoption.  Addressing  these  issues  is essential 
to unlock the full potential of private sector contributions to AI advancement.  


5 Example  1: ~$5M Bounty for Compliance  Template  Toolkit: This initiative  tackles  the high cost 
of compliance by funding an open -source sandbox template pre -loaded with NIST -lite security 
controls, tailored for startups developing NSF AI tools. By reducing setup expenses —often 
thousands in auditing and configuration —this toolkit empowers small teams to meet government 
standards swiftly, delivering a usable product by 2026 for at least 50 developers. Scalable from  
$2M to $10M,  it ensures  flexibility  for broader  adoption  across  agencies  like NIH, enhancing  NSF’s 
research ecosystem with cost -effective compliance solutions.  
Example 2:  ~$10M Bounty for Sandbox API Integrator: This bounty addresses technical 
barriers by creating an open -source API layer integrating NSF data (e.g., Research.gov) into a 
MedStack -style sandbox,  easing  access  for individual  developers.  By 2026,  it will deliver  a tested 
API supporting 10 AI tools, scalable from $5M to $20M, and adaptable for other agencies’ 
datasets (e.g., DoD’s DARPA systems), fostering seamless collaboration and innovation across 
government platforms.  Goal:  Our goal is to streamline collaboration between startups, businesses researchers, and 
government by funding bounties for open -source tools that simplify cybersecurity and 
compliance with federal standards. A MedStack -inspired sandbox (pre -configured with NIST -
lite standards) will lower technical and financial barriers, enabling efficient development of AI 
research tools for NSF and beyond. These tools will be scalable across agencies (e.g., NSF, 
DoD, NIH) to create a unified, efficient compliance  framework,  accelerating  private -sector  
engagement  while  ensuring  security and interoperability.  
3.AI PROCESS  REVIEW  AUTOMATION  (AI WITH  HUMAN -IN-THE-LOOP  PILOTS )
Key Issues: Government agencies, including NSF, face significant inefficiencies in processing
research proposals, compliance reviews, and funding decisions due to manual workflows,
fragmented documentation systems, and inconsistent decision - making criteria. AI -driven
process automation offers a powerful solution, yet full automation poses risks related to
bias, explainability, and regulatory compliance. A Human -in-the-Loop  (HITL)  approach
ensures  that AI tools  augment  human  reviewers rather than replace them, increasing
efficiency while maintaining accountability, accuracy, and regulatory transparency.
Goal: To modernize NSF’s review processes with AI -driven automation and human oversight,  
reducing  manual  workload  while  ensuring  accuracy,  fairness,  and regulatory compliance. AI -
assisted tools for document classification, compliance audits, and funding analysis will 
accelerate decision -making while maintaining transparency.  
The FDA PIONEER  proposal  (see link) provides  a framework  for AI-enhanced  
regulatory workflows with human oversight. A similar approach can streamline NSF’s grant 
review process, integrating AI for document analysis, automated compliance checks, and 
precedent tracking to reduce administrative burdens while preserving human  validation  at key 
decision  points.  By 2026,  an NSF AI Process  Review  Pilot  will be  launched,  using  a HITL  model  
to automate  initial  review  steps  while  enabling  human reviewers to refine AI -generated 
recommendations before final approval. The system will be designed for scalability across 
agencies such as NIH, DOE, and the NSF  


6  Example:  ~$10M AI Process  Review Automation  Pilot (HITL) 
This initiative funds an AI -assisted, Human -in-the-Loop (HITL) system to streamline NSF grant 
and research proposal reviews, reducing processing time while ensuring accuracy and 
compliance. AI will automate document classification, compliance checks, and funding eligibility 
analysis,  with human  reviewers  overseeing  final decisions.  Launching  by 2026,  the system  will cut 
review  times  by 50%,  improving  efficiency  while  maintaining  transparency.  Scalable  from $10M  to 
$75M,  it will lay the foundation  for cross -agency  adoption  at NIH, DOE,  and other  research 
institutions.  
Example:  ~$500M FAST-CHIP (Future AI Semiconductor  & Technology  Chip R&D Program) 
This initiative accelerates U.S. -led AI chip innovation, funding energy -efficient AI processors, 
reversible computing, and next -generation semiconductor architectures to reduce AI power 
consumption and supply chain vulnerabilities. By supporting hybrid computing architectures, AI - 
specific  chip designs,  and quantum -inspired  logic,  FAST -CHIP  enables  startups,  universities,  and 
semiconductor firms to develop high -performance, low -power AI hardware. Launching by 2026, 
the program will fund 50+ AI chip R&D projects, establish a national AI chip testbed, and support 
pilot-scale  semiconductor  fabs for domestic  production.  Scalable  from $200M  to $1B, FAST -CHIP 
strengthens U.S. leadership in AI hardware, ensuring sustainable AI infrastructure for NSF, DoD, 
NIH, and industry applications while reducing reliance on foreign chip manufacturing.  research  funding  ecosystem,  creating  a faster,  more  efficient  research  grant  evaluation pipeline.

energy/cost -effective  solutions  to power  computational  demands.  Foreign  reliance on  chips  and 
high  energy  costs  stifles  private  sector  innovation,  while  research  requires reliable 
infrastructure to remain competitive. Leading in AI hardware innovation necessitates domestic 
production breakthroughs, such as reversible computing, to enhance efficiency. Research into 
novel basic science, such as materials science and energy storage solutions like the hybrid 
supercapacitors (HYCAPs)  proposal detailed in at this link, is essential to translating these 
advances into efficient chip hardware.  
Simultaneously, supporting energy  needs for research demands scalable, low -power designs  
to reduce  costs,  ensuring  NSF-funded  projects  drive  transformative  progress without 
resource constraints.  
Goal:  NSF will spearhead  AI chip  R&D  , ensuring  the U.S. remains  at the forefront  of 
energy/cost -efficient AI hardware development, which is most cost effective for businesses 
and the government. By funding foundational research in AI -specific semiconductor 
architectures, hybrid computing, and reversible computing, NSF will:

open -source AI tools will provide practical workforce skills in AI hardware and infrastructure, 
ensuring future readiness for semiconductor and AI -related industries.  The ItemFarm  platform, 
(more info here), demonstrates how 3D and engineering/STEM curriculum can be seamlessly 
integrated into the classroom and in kids’ extracurricular activities..  funded research, startups, and commercial applications.  We are aware of the CHIPS Act  and 
TSMC’s  recent  $100  billion  commitment  to U.S. semiconductor  manufacturing; the FAST -CHIP 
program could be designed to complement and synergize with these initiatives or be 
developed as an independent initiative.  
 
5. RESEARCH , EDUCATION , AND  WORKFORCE  
Key Issues: AI is transforming industries, driving demand in AI chip manufacturing, data 
centers, and research, yet the U.S. faces a critical AI talent shortage. Nations like China are 
outpacing the U.S. in STEM graduates and AI patents, integrating AI education as early as age 
six in some regions.  Limited access to high -quality STEM and engineering education weakens 
workforce readiness, while bureaucratic funding delays and outdated policies hinder AI 
innovation. Without scalable, merit -based AI workforce  initiatives,  the U.S. risks  falling  behind  
in global  AI competitiveness,  impacting economic  growth  and national security. Investing in  AI 
and engineering education  today lays the foundation for a skilled workforce to sustain the AI, 
semiconductor, and hardware industries of the future.  
Goal  
- Expand  early  AI/STEM  programs  to prepare  K-12 students  for AI-driven  industries.  
- Fund  AI-driven  tutoring  and training  tools  to support  personalized  learning, 
workforce retraining, and upskilling.  
- Support  hands -on AI technical  training  to ensure  a strong  pipeline  of AI talent  for the 
semiconductor, cloud computing, and AI research sectors.  
Through targeted funding and research  incentives, NSF  will enhance  AI education  and 
STEM/engineering  accessibility,  build  a merit -based  AI workforce,  and drive  innovation that 
sustains U.S. competitiveness in the global AI economy.  
The NSF -focused initiatives outlined above prioritize foundational AI research, open - source 
model development, AI licensing reform, process automation, hardware innovation, and 
workforce training. These efforts will ensure that AI advancements remain scalable, secure, and 
cost-effective, supporting both government and private sector adoption while reinforcing U.S. 
leadership in AI -driven research and infrastructure.  However, NSF alone cannot address 
broader systemic challenges such as  AI infrastructure  expansion,  supply  chain  security,  national  
security  applications,  and 


8 regulatory  modernization.  Addressing  these  needs  requires  coordinated  action  across 
multiple federal agencies, including, but not limited to Commerce, Energy, DoD,  NIH, and 
EPA, to implement policy reforms, investment strategies, and inter -agency AI adoption 
frameworks.  
The next  section  outlines  key inter -agency  initiatives,  ensuring  a holistic,  government - wide 
approach to  advancing AI capabilities,  enhancing  national competitiveness,  and mitigating 
risks while fostering private -sector innovation.  
III.INTER -AGENCY  INITIATIVES
To fully  harness  AI’s potential  across  hardware,  security,  regulation,  and beyond,  the 
U.S. requires  a coordinated  inter -agency  approach  to overcome  barriers  and accelerate private -
sector innovation. These efforts could be funded through targeted appropriations in an 
Omnibus bill , leveraging existing agency budgets (e.g., DoD’s  
$800B, NSF’s  $9B) for immediate action.  However, to  ensure transformative, long -term impact, 
we recommend a $5B -$10B AI Action Bill —modeled after the CHIPS Act ($52  billion) —to 
unify  and scale  these  initiatives . While  NSF lays the groundwork  for research and workforce 
development, broader challenges like supply chain vulnerabilities, energy costs, and regulatory 
uncertainty demand collaboration among agencies such as DoD, Commerce, and NIH. This 
section outlines concrete policy actions, from bounties boosting chip production to tax credits 
driving AI adoption, addressing  the RFI’s  listed  topics  comprehensively.  By blending  existing  
resources  with bold new investment, we aim to bolster national AI leadership and counter 
global competitors effectively.  The Inter -Agency section is structured by priority, focusing first 
on initiatives with measurable 1 -year impact outcomes, followed by long -term strategic 
investments that require cross -agency coordination. This framework balances rapid, high -
impact actions with sustained AI leadership in security and infrastructure.  
Initiatives  with  Immediate  1-Year  Impact  Outcomes

and incentives to boost AI startup innovation, foster public -private partnerships,
and ensure global AI leadership.


9  Example  1: $25M Bounty to Develop  Custom AI Software  / LLM for Patent Review (AI 
PATENT):  
Patent  review  delays —averaging  24 months  at USPTO —slow AI innovation,  creating  bottlenecks 
for startups and researchers. We propose $25M in bounties by 2026 —scalable from 5M to  
$50M —to develop an open -source LLM or AI agent system with Human -in-the-Loop oversight to 
streamline prior art searches, claim analysis, and submission reviews. This AI tool, implemented 
by USPTO and OMB, could cut prior art identification time by 80%, reduce processing costs by 
15% by 2029, and scale to 30% automation by 2035. Modeled after the PIONEER framework, it 
would  also enhance  patent  efficiency  across  DoD,  Commerce,  and private  industry,  strengthening  
U.S. innovation  competitiveness.  This phased  approach  prioritizes  rapid,  high -impact  actions  while  building long -term  AI 
capacity  across  federal agencies,  ensuring that the U.S. remains at  the forefront of AI - driven 
innovation, security, and infrastructure development.  
PRIORITY  INTER -AGENCY  INITIATIVES

adoption and innovation. Manual workflows, redundant compliance requirements, and 
inconsistent review standards create barriers for AI startups, researchers, and businesses, 
delaying the deployment of AI -driven solutions in healthcare, defense, and critical 
infrastructure.  The FDA -PIONEER proposal, referenced earlier, demonstrates how AI 
modules —such as automated precedent tracking, compliance audits, and intelligent document 
classification —can streamline regulatory processes while maintaining human oversight. These 
AI-driven enhancements can be adapted across agencies, accelerating patent reviews at 
USPTO, compliance audits at NIH, and permitting approvals at DOE and Commerce.  
Goals  
- Reducing  regulatory  bottlenecks  through  AI-assisted  reviews  that speed  up agency 
decision -making.  
- Adapting  AI-driven  regulatory  modules  across  multiple  agencies  for faster, more 
consistent compliance processes . 
- Improving  patent  processing  efficiency  by automating  prior  art searches,  claim analysis, 
and documentation reviews at USPTO.  
By 2026,  these  reforms  will accelerate  AI integration  into federal  research,  intellectual property 
protections, and national security infrastructure, ensuring faster approvals without 
compromising accuracy and oversight.  
 
 
2. HARDWARE  & INFRASTRUCTURE  EXPANSION  – AI COMPUTE , PERMITTING , AND 
REGULATORY  MODERNIZATION  


10  Example  1: Executive  Order for AI Data Center Permitting  Reform 
Mandate  AI-powered  environmental  and regulatory  reviews  to cut data  center  approval  times  by 
50% by 2026,  enabling  10+ new AI data centers  by 2029.  This initiative  will be led by EPA,  DOE,

driven military strategy.
By 2026,  at least  100 AI-enabled  defense  systems  will be deployed,  with  full operational AI 
integration in targeted DoD systems by 2035.  
4.BIOSURVEILLANCE  & CBRNE  THREAT  MITIGATION
Key Issues: The threat of AI -engineered bioweapons, synthetic pathogens, and emerging  
infectious  diseases  presents  a major  national  security  risk. However,  current biosurveillance 
lacks real -time AI capabilities, delaying responses to pandemics, and CBRNE (Chemical, 
Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives) hazards.  
•Slow  Outbreak  Detection  – AI is underutilized  in biosurveillance,  limiting  real- time
tracking of emerging biological threats.
•AI-Enabled Bioterrorism Risks – AI models could be exploited to design synthetic
pathogens,  increasing  the need  for secure  AI monitoring  and threat analysis.
•Supply  Chain  Risks  for Biodefense  – AI-powered  biosecurity  must  include supply
chain tracking for precursor materials (e.g., DNA synthesis kits and chemical
reagents).
To ensure  biodefense  readiness,  AI must  be integrated  into real-time  outbreak monitoring, 
synthetic biology risk assessments, and CBRNE threat detection.  
Goals  
-Deploy  AI-driven  biosurveillance  systems  in 50%  of states  by 2029,  ensuring  faster
outbreak response.


12  Example  1: ~$10M AI-Driven Supply Chain Security  Dashboard  
Deploy  bounty  / contest  to develop  an AI-powered  tracking  system  to monitor  precursor  chemical 
and reagent purchases, ensuring early detection of potential bioterrorism threats.  - Enhance  real-time  AI monitoring  for synthetic  biology  risks,  preventing  bioweapon 
misuse.  
- Integrate  AI-powered  supply  chain  monitoring  tools  to track  precursor  chemicals and 
reagents used in biothreats.  
By 2035,  AI will be fully  integrated  into U.S. biosurveillance  infrastructure,  with automated 
pandemic response tools deployed nationwide.  
 
SPECIAL  NOTE REGARDING  CBRNE  THREATS : CBRNE threat concerns dominate fears about  AI, with  
critics  warning  of its potential to  enable  runaway  pandemics —such  as AI- engineered nanobots 
or pathogens dubbed “super Ebolas” —that could exploit vulnerabilities and devastate 
populations unchecked. Beyond AI -driven countermeasures, practical interventions can further 
enhance effectiveness.  For example,  in addition  to hands -on experiments  continuing  being  
done  in secure,  federally overseen BSL -4 labs and it will be suggested to develop new labs in 
even farther remote areas such as Alaska where the climate and cold weather is a deterrence 
to microbial spread, minimizing accidental releases.  
 
Long -Term  Initiatives  
5. AI FOR ECONOMIC  COMPETITIVENESS  & PRIVATE  SECTOR  GROWTH  
Key Issues  
The U.S. AI sector faces mounting global competition, particularly from China and the EU, 
which are  aggressively investing  in AI R&D, compute infrastructure, and workforce 
development.  While  the U.S. leads  in foundational  AI research,  slow  commercialization, 
regulatory uncertainty, and lack of direct government incentives for AI adoption hinder 
private -sector growth.  
• AI Startup Growth Barriers – Complex procurement processes, compliance 
burdens,  and funding  gaps  prevent  AI entrepreneurs  from  scaling  innovations.  
• Limited  AI Investment  Incentives  – Tax policies  and funding  structures  do not 
adequately encourage AI infrastructure development, compute expansion, and 
adoption of AI -driven solutions.  
• Slow AI Adoption in Traditional Industries – Sectors like manufacturing, healthcare,  
finance,  and energy  lag in AI deployment  due to high  costs,  lack of AI -skilled workers, 
and unclear regulatory frameworks.  
To sustain U.S. AI leadership, the government must facilitate AI commercialization, enabling  
startups,  enterprises,  and investors  to drive  innovation  across  industries  while competing 
globally.  
Goals  
- Expand  AI startup  access  to federal  contracts  & funding , ensuring  that small businesses 
and mid -sized firms can compete alongside major tech companies.  
- Implement  AI-specific  tax incentives , including  R&D  investment  credits  and AI adoption 
subsidies, to accelerate private -sector innovation.  


13  Example 1: 30% AI Investment Tax Credit (~$500M by 2026, Scalable to $2B by 2030) 
Offer a 30% tax credit for private -sector AI R&D investments, including AI -driven automation, 
cloud  compute  infrastructure,  and workforce  training.  This incentive  will reduce  financial  barriers 
for AI startups and enterprises, driving broader AI adoption across manufacturing, logistics, 
finance, and healthcare.  
Example  2: AI Startup Incentives  & Public-Private AI  Procurement  Fund (~$1B by 2030) 
Establish  a dedicated  AI startup  procurement  program,  providing  fast-track  federal  contracting 
opportunities to AI startups, ensuring that small businesses gain access to DoD, NSF, and 
Commerce -led AI projects.  This initiative  will streamline  compliance  and funding  mechanisms, 
reducing barriers for AI startups in government contracting.  By 2026,  targeted  tax incentives  and procurement  policies  will accelerate  private -sector AI 
adoption, ensuring that U.S. companies remain globally competitive in AI development and 
deployment.  
 
 
Summary:  The Inter -Agency  AI Action  Plan  prioritizes  high -impact,  near -term  actions while 
establishing long -term AI leadership across defense, economic growth, and infrastructure  
development.  By addressing  regulatory  inefficiencies,  AI-driven  security threats, and 
commercialization barriers, this plan ensures cross -agency collaboration that complements 
NSF’s foundational research efforts.  
 
Key one-year  impact  initiatives  focus  on reducing  bureaucratic  delays,  strengthening  AI hardware  
infrastructure,  modernizing  defense  AI integration,  and deploying  AI-powered biosurveillance. 
These actions will yield measurable improvements in AI adoption, efficiency, and security by 
2026, ensuring that AI innovations transition rapidly from research to deployment.  
 
In addition to these structural reforms, we identify immediate, high -visibility AI projects that 
can deliver early successes within the next three months. These initiatives, leveraging existing 
agency budgets and scalable funding models, are designed to demonstrate  AI’s impact  swiftly  
while  building  momentum  for long -term  AI investments.  
 
Next,  we outline  targeted  AI pilot  programs  and quick -win initiatives  that can be launched 
immediately to generate measurable results.

V.CONCLUSION
This AI Action Plan (ACCEL -MAX) delivers a scalable, results -driven framework to secure  
U.S. leadership  in AI innovation,  economic  growth,  and national  security.  By integrating 
NSF-led research with inter -agency collaboration, it addresses critical  


15  priorities —workforce  readiness,  hardware  innovation,  regulatory  efficiency,  and defense 
applications —while maximizing taxpayer value through prize -based incentives and strategic 
deregulation.  
Immediate Impact (Within 1 Year): Launching high -visibility pilots by May 2025, such as the 
$50K DIY Drone Actuator Contest and $30K CBRNE Precursor Detection Bounty,  will yield  
tangible  outcomes —enhancing  defense  logistics  and biosurveillance — while identifying talent 
and building public enthusiasm. These quick wins, executable with discretionary funds, will 
accelerate AI adoption across agencies and demonstrate proof -of-concept efficiency by August 
2025.  
 
Long -Term  Leadership  (3-5 Years):  Strategic  investments,  including  $100M  NSF AI bounties 
and $500M DoD defense bounties, will expand AI education to 50% of U.S. students by 2029, 
boost domestic AI chip capacity by 20% by 2029, and deploy nationwide AI -driven 
biosurveillance by 2035. These milestones counter global competitors like China, ensuring 
sustained economic and security advantages.  
 
A $5B -$10B AI Action Bill is not merely an option but a critical part of this vision. Modeled  
after  the CHIPS  Act ($52  billion),  it will unify  NSF research,  DoD  AI integration, and Commerce -
led hardware initiatives into a cohesive national strategy, funding transformative efforts like 
the $500M FAST -CHIP program to end foreign chip reliance. Without this investment, the U.S. 
risks ceding AI dominance to rivals outpacing us in R&D and infrastructure.  
 
Call to Action:  We recommend  that OSTP  and NITRD  start  pilot  projects  as soon  as possible —for 
example, starting with the drone contest by May 2025 —to generate momentum, while 
advocating for the AI Action Bill in 2025 to secure long -term competitiveness . This dual -track 
approach balances rapid deployment with sustained growth, positioning the U.S. as the global AI 
leader.  
 
Closing: Artificial intelligence is the foundation of future economic prosperity, security, and 
scientific discovery . This plan offers a scalable, high -efficiency approach to maximize societal 
benefits and taxpayer value.  The plan also leverages NSF’s expertise  in research  and 
education  while  integrating  inter -agency  efforts  to drive real -world AI  adoption.  AI must 
transition from an  abstract technological challenge to a cornerstone of national resilience —
ensuring economic growth (e.g., AI -driven manufacturing jobs), national security (e.g., AI -
powered defense systems), and public trust (e.g., transparent AI governance).  
 
Through  this balanced,  results -oriented  approach,  the United  States  will not only lead in AI 
innovation but set the global standard for AI preparedness and resilience.
