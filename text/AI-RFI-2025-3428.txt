* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
Hello. I do not believe that this plan should m ove forward in any way, shape or form . AI that is utilizing technology to steal from  artists and
m akers of m edia, am ong other things is entirely harm ful to as a whole and has no place or future in the US.
This is not a way to stand up to China but to allow for profiteering off of other people's work, which wholey seem s to go against what this
country is purported to be built on in term s of values.
AI that steals from  people's works has currently m ade m y ability to m ake m oney utilizing m y skillset difficult and has m ade it difficult to
find work utilizing m y skills. It will create m ore problem s if allowed to continue with no regard for copyright protections.
Lastly, AI that is intentionally program m ed to take from  people and to autom ate away jobs at the expense of people's livelihoods is said to
be som e golden egg that will bring great fortune to m any but it has really been an overhyped flash-in-the-pan that will sim ply result in
greater grifting and fleecing of people's m oney and tim e. It is not built to last and is already becom ing m ore costly to run as said by m ultiple
com panies
