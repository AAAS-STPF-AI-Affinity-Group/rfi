General Comment
AI is an under-regulated m ess and a disaster for privacy. The line between private life and private intelectual property is thinly drawn;
loosening copyright protections for AI risks the creation of virtual revenge porn- a failure state already witnessed, according to som e news
stories, even in cases involving m inors. This is fundam entally unconscionable. We cannot continue to enable a parasitic technology that
weaponizes the public sphere against its occupants- to do so is to destroy the relationship between civilians and society.
