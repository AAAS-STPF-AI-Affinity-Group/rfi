General Comment
I don't believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica as this will put m any artists and writers out of jobs and they won't have any
place to work. OpenAI and every other AI com pany will have im m unity and take every single job that's im portant to hum ans and
billionaires and CEOs will keep getting richer.
