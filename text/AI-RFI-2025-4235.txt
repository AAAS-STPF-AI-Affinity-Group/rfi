General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US nor do I believe AI has any benefit to the com m on Am erican citizen. AI is built off
of the stolen work of other people for the sole purpose of replacing and displacing the people they stole from . It is an inherently evil
technology that only benefits the richest people in the US. No new jobs will be created by this, it has no value and the prom ises it does tell
are overhyped at best and lied about at worst. 
If you think for a second that AI won't be used to spread m isinform ation on those in charge and the elite in this country you are wrong.
Until a utopic scarcity free society is established AI developm ent should be the last thing we should be investing in
