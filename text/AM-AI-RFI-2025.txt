Citizens interact with government services at critical moments in their lives. During health crises, 
financial hardship, natural disasters, or major life transitions. Beyond efficiency gains, AI -powered 
services can make government more accessible to all citizens, including those with disabilities, limited 
English profic iency, or limited digital literacy.  
3.0 Public -Private Collaboration: The Role of Public -Private 
Partnerships & Value -for-Money Framework  in the “Age of AI”  
3.1. The Strategic Imperative for AI -Enhanced Public -Private Partnerships  
Public -Private Partnerships (PPPs) represent a critical mechanism for advancing America's AI dominance 
while optimizing government resources and fostering private sector innovation .  Traditional PPPs have 
demonstrated effectiveness in infrastructure development, but AI demands a new generation of 
collaborative frameworks . These partnerships are specifically designed to address the unique challenges 
of AI development, including massive computational requirements, data access needs, talent scarcity, 
and the r apid pace of technological change.  
PPPs  in the Age of AI  need to evolve  from traditional arrangements in several ways:  
1.Accelerated Development Cycles: Modern  PPPs incorporate agile development methodologies,
allowing for rapid prototyping, testing, and deployment cycles measured in months ; not years.
2.Dynamic Risk Allocation: Given the evolving nature of AI technology, AI -Enhanced PPPs
incorporate flexible risk -sharing mechanisms that adjust as technologies mature and new
challenges emerge.
3.Outcomes -Based Success Metrics: Rather than focusing solely on project completion milestones,
AI-Enhanced PPPs track impact metrics like processing time reductions, decision quality
improvements, and return on investment.
The White House should issue an Executive Order directing federal agencies to prioritize AI -Enhanced 
PPPs in their technology modernization efforts, with specific guidance on flexible procurement 
mechanisms, accelerated approval processes, and risk -sharing  models appropriate for AI initiatives  
3.2. Priority Areas for AI -Enhanced PPPs  
We recommend prioritizing AI -Enhanced PPPs in the following high -impact domains:  
Recommendation E1:  National AI Research Infrastructure  
The computational requirements for developing cutting -edge AI models have increased exponentially, 
with training costs for frontier models now exceeding $100 million. This scale of investment is

9 prohibitive for most research institutions and startups, creating a competitive advantage for large 
technology companies and well -funded foreign competitors. A national research infrastructure would 
democratize access to computing resources, accelerate inn ovation across sectors, and ensure U.S. 
leadership in next -generation AI development.  
We recommend establishing a National AI Compute Consortium that:  
•Creates a network of government -industry shared supercomputing facilities specifically
optimized for AI workloads, with specialized hardware accelerators that deliver 10 -100x
performance improvements over general -purpose computing systems
•Implements tiered access models allowing researchers from academia, government, and
qualifying small businesses to access computational resources based on project merit and
national priority alignment, with subsidized rates for projects advancing national security or
economic competitiveness
•Develops specialized hardware accelerators and novel computational architectures optimized
for next -generation AI models, including neuromorphic computing, optical AI accelerators, and
quantum -inspired systems
The Department of Energy's national laboratories, in partnership with the National Science Foundation, 
should establish a coordinating council with leading AI hardware companies, cloud providers, and 
research institutions. This council would define technic al specifications, coordinate resource allocation, 
and oversee development of a unified access portal for the distributed computing resources.  
Recommendation E2: AI-Driven Critical Infrastructure Protection  
Critical infrastructure systems including power grids, transportation networks, and water management 
systems represent both prime opportunities for AI optimization and significant security vulnerabilities. 
Recent cyber -attacks have demonstrated the vulnera bility of these systems, with potential disruptions 
costing billions and threatening national security. AI offers unprecedented capabilities to detect 
anomalies, predict vulnerabilities, and automate responses at a speed and scale impossible for human 
oper ators.  
We recommend:  
•Deploying AI -powered anomaly detection systems across critical infrastructure networks to
identify and respond to cyber threats in real -time, capable of processing millions of system
events per second to identify subtle patterns indicating potential attack s
•Implementing AI -enhanced predictive maintenance solutions to reduce system failures and
extend infrastructure lifespan, leveraging multimodal data from sensors, operational logs, and
external factors to anticipate failures before they occur
•Creating autonomous system restoration capabilities that can rapidly respond to physical or
cyber disruptions, minimizing downtime and preventing cascading failures across
interconnected systems
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Energy (DOE) should jointly 
establish a Critical Infrastructure AI Security Initiative, partnering with infrastructure operators and 
technology companies to develop reference architectures, de ployment guides, and evaluation 
frameworks for AI security solutions across critical sectors.  
Recommendation E3: AI Workforce Development  
The severe shortage of AI talent represents one of the most significant constraints on U.S. AI leadership. 
Current estimates indicate a shortage of over 300,000 AI -skilled workers nationwide, with competition

10 for talent driving salaries to unsustainable levels for many organizations. This talent gap particularly 
affects government agencies, small businesses, and critical infrastructure operators who cannot match 
the compensation packages offered by large techno logy companies.  
We recommend:  
•Creating an AI Skills Certification Framework that establishes recognized credentials for AI
professionals at various proficiency levels, from technical implementers to strategic leaders,
providing a clear pathway for career advancement and skill developme nt
•Expanding the National Science Foundation's AI Research Institutes program to include intensive
AI training programs for mid -career professionals, focusing on practical implementation skills
and domain -specific applications rather than purely theoretical k nowledge
•Establishing tax incentives for companies that invest substantially in AI workforce development
programs, with enhanced incentives for programs targeting underrepresented communities,
veterans, and displaced workers from traditional industries
The Department of Labor, in partnership with the National Science Foundation and industry 
associations, should establish a National AI Skills Coalition tasked with developing standardized 
curricula, certification programs, and workforce transition pathways . This coalition would coordinate 
with community colleges, universities, and online learning platforms to rapidly scale training capacity.  
Recommendation E4: Sovereign AI Model Development  
Foundation AI models increasingly represent critical digital infrastructure, with applications spanning 
healthcare, financial services, defense, and government operations. Current development of these 
models is dominated by a small number of large technolo gy companies and foreign entities, creating 
potential dependencies and vulnerabilities in applications critical to national security and economic 
resilience.  
We recommend:  
•Establishing a consortium of U.S. companies and research institutions to develop sovereign,
U.S.-controlled foundation models for strategic applications, ensuring that critical AI capabilities
remain under U.S. jurisdiction and aligned with American values
•Creating secure testing environments for evaluating model capabilities and vulnerabilities prior
to deployment, allowing rigorous assessment without exposing sensitive capabilities or
weaknesses
•Developing specialized AI models optimized for government applications with enhanced security
and explainability features, prioritizing trustworthiness and alignment with legal and ethical
requirements over raw performance metrics
DARPA, in collaboration with the National Security Council and leading research universities, should 
coordinate a multi -year initiative to develop, evaluate, and deploy sovereign AI models across priority 
government applications. This initiative should lev erage existing research programs while establishing 
new partnership models with industry.  
3.3. Applying the Value -for-Money Framework to U.S. AI Leadership 
Imperatives  
Proper evaluation of AI investments requires a systematic framework that captures both quantitative 
returns and qualitative benefits while accounting for the unique characteristics of AI technologies. 
Traditional return -on-investment calculations often fail to capture the full value of AI implementations,

11 leading to underinvestment in high -potential applications and misallocation of resources across 
competing priorities.  
A Value -for-Money (VfM) Framework  provides a structured method for evaluating AI investments based 
on efficiency, transparency, and national strategic objectives.  
Figure 1:  Value -for-Money Framework for evaluating U.S. National AI investments  
VfM Framework 
Component  Application to U.S. AI Leadership Imperatives  
Real -Time Cost -
Benefit Analysis  AI project funding should prioritize high -ROI use cases like AI -powered 
fraud detection in Medicare/Medicaid and cybersecurity for national 
defense.  
Performance -Linked 
Payments  AI vendors in PPPs should be incentivized through milestone -based 
funding, ensuring government AI initiatives deliver measurable 
impact.  
Risk Allocation 
Optimization  AI-related risks (e.g., cybersecurity threats, bias in AI models) should 
be assigned to the entities best equipped to mitigate them —ensuring 
national security remains a government function while industry drives 
innovation.  
AI-Enhanced Public 
Impact 
Measurement  AI investments should be tracked through citizen impact metrics, such 
as improved service delivery times in healthcare, reduced energy 
consumption, and faster response times in disaster relief.  
Continuous 
Monitoring & 
Adaptive 
Governance  AI PPP projects should be continuously evaluated using real -time AI -
driven performance analytics, allowing for rapid course corrections.  
This VfM approach de -risks public AI investments, ensuring taxpayer funds are used effectively and that 
AI investments  align  across five critical dimensions:  
Real -Time Cost -Benefit Analysis  
Traditional cost -benefit analyses often fail to capture the exponential nature of AI capabilities and the 
network effects of successful implementations. Static analyses conducted at project initiation become 
rapidly outdated as AI systems evolve, data accumulates, and use cases expand. Real -time analysis 
ensures investment decisions reflect current system performance and emerging opportunities.  
A real-time approach incorporates:  
•Dynamic ROI Modeling: AI investments often demonstrate increasing returns as data
accumulates and models improve. to continuously refine ROI projections based on observed
performance data, adjusting projections as systems mature and capabilities evolve.

12 •Multi -Factor Benefit Quantification: Quantif y benefits such as improved decision quality,
reduced risk exposure, enhanced innovation capacity, and strengthened competitive
positioning.
•Externality Accounting: Incorporate positive and negative externalities, including environmental
impacts, privacy implications, and broader economic effects.
OMB should update Circular A -94 (Guidelines for Cost -Benefit Analysis) to incorporate AI -specific 
valuation methodologies, including guidance on quantifying decision quality improvements, risk 
reduction benefits, and network effects resulting from AI imple mentations.  
Performance -Linked Payment Structures  
Traditional government contracting models incentivize technology delivery rather than outcome 
achievement, leading to systems that technically meet specifications but fail to deliver real -world value. 
AI projects are particularly vulnerable to this misalig nment, as technical performance metrics may 
correlate weakly with operational impact. Performance -linked payment structures ensure that vendors 
and government agencies maintain focus on valuable outcomes rather than technical specifications.  
Our framework recommends:  
•Outcome -Based Contracts: Structure vendor contracts around specific, measurable performance
improvements (e.g., fraud detection rates, processing time reductions) rather than technology
delivery milestones. This approach aligns vendor incentives with gover nment objectives and
shifts performance risk to the party best positioned to manage it.
•Sliding Scale Incentives: Implement payment structures that increase vendor compensation
when outcomes exceed targets and reduce payments when targets are missed. This approach
creates continuous improvement incentives rather than binary success/failure cr iteria.
•Long -Tail Performance Bonuses: Include incentives for sustained performance improvements
that accrue as AI systems gather more data and improve over time. This approach encourages
vendors to design self -improving systems rather than static solutions requir ing constant manual
updates.
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) should be updated to establish AI -specific contract vehicles 
that facilitate outcome -based payments, including multi -year performance measurement and flexible 
payment structures that can adapt to evolving system cap abilities.  
3.4. Implementing Strategic AI Economic Zones  
AI innovation thrives in ecosystems that combine specialized infrastructure, regulatory clarity, talent 
concentration, and collaborative frameworks. The distributed nature of U.S. innovation creates 
strengths through diversity but can impede the critical m ass necessary for breakthrough advances. 
Strategic AI Economic Zones create focused environments where resources, talent, and policy 
innovations converge to accelerate development in priority domains.  
To accelerate the development and deployment of AI -Enhanced PPPs, we recommend establishing 
Strategic AI Economic Zones (SAEZs) that provide concentrated environments for AI innovation with 
specialized regulatory frameworks, infrastructure investments, and  collaborative ecosystems.  
Each SAEZ would feature:

13 •Streamlined Regulatory Frameworks: Tailored regulatory environments that maintain
appropriate safeguards while expediting AI development and testing.
•Shared Infrastructure: Pre -built computational resources, data management systems, and
physical facilities optimized for AI research and deployment.
•Talent Concentration: Educational partnerships, visa programs, and incentive structures to
attract and retain top AI talent.
•Implementation Strategy: The Department of Commerce, in partnership with state governments
and private sector leaders, should establish a SAEZ development program with federal matching
funds for qualified zones, regulatory coordination assistance, and spec ialized visa allocations for
participating organizations.
We recommend establishing five initial SAEZs, each with distinct specialization:  
AI Innovation Zones  
Five specialized AI innovation hubs across the United States, each with distinct focus areas:  
1.National Security AI Zone (Northern Virginia): Defense, intelligence, and critical infrastructure
applications in partnership with DoD, intelligence agencies, and defense contractors.
2.Healthcare AI Zone (Boston/Cambridge): Medical diagnostics, drug discovery, and healthcare
delivery optimization in collaboration with teaching hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and
healthcare technology firms.
3.Financial Services AI Zone (New York): Financial risk management, fraud detection, and market
analysis through partnerships with financial institutions, regulatory agencies, and fintech
startups.
4.Manufacturing and Supply Chain AI Zone (Detroit/Pittsburgh): Industrial automation, predictive
maintenance, and supply chain resilience in cooperation with manufacturing companies,
logistics providers, and industrial engineering programs.
5.Agricultural and Climate AI Zone (California Central Valley): Sustainable agriculture, resource
management, and climate adaptation in partnership with agricultural producers, environmental
agencies, and climate technology companies.
Congress should authorize the Department of Commerce to establish a Strategic AI Economic Zone 
program, with appropriations for matching grants, regulatory coordination staff, and specialized visa 
programs for qualifying AI professionals and students.
