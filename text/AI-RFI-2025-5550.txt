General Comment
I am  an everyday m iddle-class Am erican-- an elem entary art teacher and a children's book author and illustrator, who previously worked
in gam e design for the educational gam e "Poptropica." 
I am  utterly appalled that any branch of the US governm ent would allow AI big tech corporations to pillage our creative work without our
consent-- work that we have spent a lifetim e building and honing. This work is our livelihood. 
AI does not "train" on copyrighted work. It steals it, reconfigures it, and spits it back out without any sort of com pensation. It is robbing
people who have worked tirelessly, and putting m illions of careers in jeopardy. 
The US m ust stop allowing Big Tech to tram ple actual people. Gen AI needs to be heavily restricted, and never allowed to steal personal
works without full perm ission. When a governm ent stops protecting everyday citizens, and instead favors dishonest Big Tech practices,
then that governm ent has utterly failed. And people will rem em ber.
