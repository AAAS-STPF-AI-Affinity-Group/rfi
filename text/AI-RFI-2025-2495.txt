General Comment
"Ensuring the United States is the undeniable leader in AI technology"? It's a tech bubble, and a painfully obvious one at that. AI is wrong
about known facts just as often as it is right, hallucinates inform ation frequently, and som etim es can't even do m ath correctly - the one
thing com puters are supposed to be good at. This is em barrassing. What if this effort was directed towards m aking our country an
undeniable leader in literally anything m ore useful, like superior agricultural productivity or cutting edge m edical technology or som ething
else tangibly beneficial to the Am erican people?
