Generative AI such as OpenAI, MidJourney, or any other AI model that steals and copies 
materia l for AI training is theft. Promoting and protecting such technologies does not help or 
support the American people, but in fact steals property and jobs from both Americans and people around the world. Other AI technologies utilized in medical research and other developmental fields do have applications, allowing the compilation and processing of large amounts of data. Generative AI has NO practical or beneficial use, and should not benefit from being allowed to freely steal copyrighted content for training, nor allowed to steal jobs from artists, actors, and other creative and talented people. Strong opposition for and promotion or protections for Generative AI te chnologies.
