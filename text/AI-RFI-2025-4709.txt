General Comment
Generative AI does nothing of actual benefit while rem oving jobs from  the econom y. Hum ans deserve to be recognized and com pensated
for their creations. If another hum an requires the use of those creations, whether for their own use or to train an AI m odel, they should
com pensate the creator appropriately. To allow free use in this case is allowing theft on a m ass scale, and I do not want any of m y tax
m oney funding theft from  the Am erican public.
