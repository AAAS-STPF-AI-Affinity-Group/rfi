Faisal D’Souza and NITRD staff,
As a tech worker I am writing to make public my deep disapproval of the recent RFI “AI Action Plan”submitted per
Executive Order.
This proposal promotes the intellectual theft of pre-existing works to further train AI models and deepens a
dangerous precedent. The RFI claims that this theft is justified to “enhance America’s AI dominance,” ostensiblyagainst China - but we have already lost the race if we are stealing rather than innovating, eschewing criticalregulations, and giving private industry carte blanche to develop economy-upending, deeply flawed technologieswithout any accountability to the American people.
I condemn this proposal as it is currently written and urge you to reject it until and unless it can be refined to
demand respect for intellectual property law and protection for consumers.
Thank you,
Christeene Alcosiba
