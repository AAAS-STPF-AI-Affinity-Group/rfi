I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. This technology creates derivative, inconsistent results that
have no true practical advantage.
AI steals from my livelihood as an American and profits off of theft. It scrapes the work of creative endeavors in an
attempt to remove the human component from creative endeavors. Artists, writers, and more will suffer severefinancial repercussions that will resonate through the economy. These artists do not see compensation or even creditfor their forced contribution to a technological product. If a business model demands theft as a core necessity, it isnot a valid business model.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the American public. There is no public demand for this technology or its
integration into other technologies. Itâ€™s forced application is creating expenses and complications for the Americanpublic.
