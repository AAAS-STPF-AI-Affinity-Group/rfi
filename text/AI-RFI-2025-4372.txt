General Comment
I'm  not sorry for saying this. What is wrong with the US? EVERYONE is expected to follow copyright laws. A.I. "training" is plagiarism .
It steals trades and livelihood of Am ericans, including m e. With m illions invested into AI and little to show for it, it is overhyped in the
public and shoved into our faces. AI does not have a place in the future for the US, in trades, in healthcare, in program s. Stop it. Do not
strip away m y trade, do not jeopardize the Am erican people from  their living. You are giving it away to theft and m aking theft profitable.
