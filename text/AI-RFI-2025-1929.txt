General Comment
Research into AI should be thoroughly subject to all applicable laws and ethical standards, including and especially use of copyrighted
m aterial in training. If the AI generates output, it should be even m ore heavily scrutinized, especially if it's output is designed to com pete
with hum an generated copyrightable m aterial.
No exceptions should be m ade.
Priority for any funding should be given to projects with explicitly clear, achievable goals and endpoints. Projects such as m achine learning
to help identify cancers and other ailm ents are one of the best uses of the broad range of technology, for exam ple, while every project
claim ing it's aim ing for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is fraud that should be investigated. Not only is the technology not capable of
that yet, our own psychological understanding is not to a point where we could identify the qualities of AGI or create it.
As an AI designer for video gam es, it has been stunning how m any people have readily been taken in by con m en prom ising the world
when all they have is cheap parlor tricks. Regulation needs to be potentially added so fake bubbles like OpenAI and ChatGPT don't rise
to such useless popularity when they don't offer any helpful products to the world.
Any country creating tech like OpenAI's work is wasting m oney, and we shouldn't waste any m ore of ours. Other AI fields are with
investigating, but there shouldn't be a single dim e wasted on the LLM subfield of AI or anyone prom ising AGI.
