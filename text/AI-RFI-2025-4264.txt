General Comment
Do not let OpenAI use copyrights m aterial to train their AI. It is blatant theft, and AI does not have a place in the future of the U.S. It’s a
threat- jobs and livelihoods are stolen, increasing the unem ploym ent rate. It consum es resources and energy better used for other projects
and developm ents, least of all water. It profits off of theft and is seeking to sidestep legalities that exist as protections for precisely
scenarios like this.   
Please stop OpenAI, the possibility of things becom ing even worse for questionable and m inim al gains is ludicrous and short sighted; or it
is a sign of blatant corruption and a lack of care for the Am erican people. Either situation is terrible and dam ning for the com petence and
or intentions of the current individuals within the White House.
