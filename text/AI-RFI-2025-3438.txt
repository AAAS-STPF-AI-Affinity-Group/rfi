General Comment
We have already seen that these com panies, if given the ability to sim ply run away with no regulation or focus or plan, will sim ply burn
m oney. Giving these com panies blatant, unrestricted access to steal from  artists and other Am erican businesses, violating their copyrights
which are enshrined in the Constitution, won't lead to better products. Chinese com petitors have shown m ore innovation while operating
under tighter restrains with less advanced technology. 
If a com pany needs all the m oney in the world and free access to every copyrighted work ever created in order to m ake a product, that
doesn't sound like a very sm art or efficient com pany. That sounds like som eone creating excuses because they can't deliver. 
Do not allow these com panies to tram ple our constitutional rights. Constraints breed creativity- Som ething these com panies clearly and
sorely need.
