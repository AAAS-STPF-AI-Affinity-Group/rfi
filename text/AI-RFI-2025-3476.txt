General Comment
Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a program  has been pushed forward by large com panies like Google but even to this day has yet to produce
a practical product. In m any cases, the AI interferes with the casual use of say a search engine. In recent m em ory, AI com panies have
stated that they are aware of any legal problem s with their program s taking from  existing works but have m ade no conscious effort to fix
this problem . 
Giving AI corporations a form  of im m unity from  copyright laws will not im prove the product and m ight even open up other countries with
their own AI program  such as China an open reign to take from  Am erican com panies. 
The sim plem inded goal of getting a m achine to produce a product for less m oney isn't worth tearing down the foundation that m akes it
possible to profit from  said product.
