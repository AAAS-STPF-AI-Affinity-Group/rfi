General Comment
AI has no place in our governm ent. It has m assive security holes, provides incorrect inform ation regularly, and the m ajority of AI that have
been created which will be used as a part of this action plan have illegally consum ed copyrighted m aterial. 
All results from  AI are required to be reviewed, and potentially corrected, by hum ans which m eans there is no cost or tim e savings when
using an AI. 
Thank you.
