General Comment
As an Am erican, m y freedom  to the Am erican Dream  hinges on m y right to create som ething worthwhile and profit from  it: for m y
livelihood and m y fam ily. AI is already taking the jobs of artists and creators like m e while being powered by our work with no
recom pense. This outright theft of our intellectual property is un-Am erican and wrong.
