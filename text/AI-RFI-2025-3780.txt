General Comment
Don't give AI this kind of power over copyright. This is going to allow AI to encroach upon and just blatantly steal as it pleases overall
and will harm  everyone in the US in the long run. I don't think this kind of plan has any place being put into action in m y country and
threatens people's livelihoods. AI is also being used as an over-hyped buzzword for efficiency and hiding how these types of system s are
going to affect people's work in general, and how it works to do the work it does.
