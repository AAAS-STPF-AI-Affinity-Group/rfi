General Comment
Allowing AI to pull from  any copyrighted work would be hugely detrim ental to every creative industry, not to m ention the m orally
inconsiderate concept of allowing m achines to be trained on the work of real, living people without their consent. Many artists are not the
m illionaire celebrities often shown in the press; they rely on ownership over their work - lim ited though it m ay be in current tim es - in order
to m ake a living.
