General Comment
AI technology can have uses in a wide variety of fields, but there's zero reason to allow AI com panies to ignore copyright law to "train"
generative AI. Feeding language m odels or art m odels has nothing to do with im proving national security or m aintaining a com petitive
edge, it is just an excuse to replace Am erican writers and artists with a lesser facsim ile of them selves. Out of work Am ericans m eans less
taxes and a less com petitive Am erica.
