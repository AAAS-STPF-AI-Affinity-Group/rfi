I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the development of an AI Action Plan. As a 
researcher in computing, AI, and cybersecurity, I would like to emphasize the critical role of 
federal funding for fundamental scientific research in ensuring the c ontinued advancement and 
responsible development of AI technologies. One of the most concerning trends this year has 
been the erosion of federal support for fundamental research, particularly within the NSF. AI 
research does not occur in isolation; it reli es on a strong foundation of discoveries from 
mathematics, physics, cognitive science, cybersecurity, and computer systems research. 
Reductions in funding for NSF and other federal research agencies jeopardize this ecosystem, 
limiting the potential for bre akthrough innovations and hindering the United States' ability to 
maintain global leadership in AI. AI research does not exist in a vacuum. Its success depends on 
interdisciplinary collaboration with fields such as neuroscience, linguistics, material scien ces, 
and cybersecurity, among many others. Without sustained investment in these interconnected 
disciplines, AI research will face significant barriers in areas such as explainability, robustness, 
and security. Moreover, policy discussions on AI funding sh ould not be confined solely to AI -
specific initiatives but should also include substantial investments in basic sciences, high -
performance computing, and research infrastructure. AI models are increasingly reliant on 
advancements in quantum computing, semi conductor technology, and biological computing, all 
of which require strong government -backed research support. If the U.S. government is serious 
about maintaining AI leadership, it must reverse the trend of funding cuts for fundamental 
research and commit  to a comprehensive, long -term AI research strategy that strengthens 
investments across multiple scientific domains. This approach should include: Increased NSF 
funding to support foundational AI and interdisciplinary research. Sustained support for high -
risk, high-reward research that industry alone is unlikely to fund. Enhancing collaboration 
between academia, government, and industry while ensuring open access to critical AI research 
findings. Investment in AI infrastructure, including secure and ethical  data-sharing platforms to 
facilitate cutting -edge research. Conclusion The success of AI research and its responsible 
deployment depend on broad -based scientific investment and an interdisciplinary approach. The 
U.S. government must prioritize funding for  basic research through NSF and other agencies 
rather than cutting critical support for the broader scientific community. Without this 
commitment, the long -term sustainability and competitiveness of AI research in the United 
States will be at serious risk.  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this discussion and 
strongly urge policymakers to reaffirm their commitment to federal funding for fundamental 
research as a cornerstone of the national AI strategy.
