General Comment
As an artist and author who depends on copyright in order to m ake a living from  m y work, I am  absolutely against the training of
generative AI program s and their dependence on data that they stole with zero com pensation. Allowing tech com panies unfettered access
to our copyrighted creative works will destroy huge subsets of the econom y. Who will own anything? Why are we fine throwing working
artists into the woodchipper so a few big com panies can get richer? Am erica's creative industries depend on HUMANS; depend on
Am erican citizens creating art and books and m ovies. If we can't live on our work, we won't create it, and the whole world will suffer.
Protect copyright. Protect artists. Protect authors. If I can't steal from  a corporation, a corporations shouldn't get to steal from  m e.
