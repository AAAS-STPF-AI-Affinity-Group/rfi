AI Action Plan for Identifying Supply Chain Anomalies and Preventing Improper Spending & 
Overpricing in Government Agencies  
 
1. Objectives & Use Cases  
 
The objective of this AI Action Plan  is to enhance financial oversight, prevent fraud, and 
improve efficiency  in government procurement and supply chain operations. By leveraging 
artificial intelligence (AI), federal agencies can detect overpricing, improper spending, contract 
fraud, and procurement anomalies  in real time.  
 
Key AI Use Cases:  
 
A. Anomaly Detection in Procurement & Spending  
• AI-powered cost benchmarking  – Comparing government contract prices with industry 
standards to detect overpricing.  
• Pattern recognition for duplicate or excessive spending  – Identifying purchases of redundant or 
unnecessary goods/services.  
• Real-time transaction monitoring  – Detecting unusual spikes in spending or sudden price hikes.  
• Supplier overcharging detection  – AI identifying price manipulation by vendors across 
different agencies.  
 
B. Supply Chain Fraud & Waste Detection  
• AI-enhanced contract fraud analysis  – Cross-referencing government contract terms with actual 
delivered goods/services.  
• Vendor relationship mapping  – Identifying conflicts of interest between suppliers and 
government officials.  
• Bulk purchase anomaly detection  – Spotting inflated bulk orders that exceed reasonable agency 
demand. 


• AI-driven invoice verification  – Flagging invoices with excessive pricing, mismatched 
quantities, or unauthorized expenses.  
 
C. Predictive Analytics for Cost Savings  
• AI forecasting for smarter budgeting  – Predicting future procurement needs to avoid last -
minute, high -cost spending.  
• Price trend analysis  – Identifying seasonal price fluctuations to optimize government 
purchasing timing.  
• Supply chain risk assessment  – AI analyzing supplier reliability, financial stability, and 
geopolitical risks.  
• Demand-supply alignment optimization  – Preventing excess inventory buildup and minimizing 
wasteful procurement.  
2. Assessment of Current Capabilities  
• Evaluate existing procurement monitoring systems  – Assess the strengths and weaknesses of 
current oversight mechanisms.  
• Identify data -sharing limitations  – Examine cross -agency access to contract pricing, 
procurement data, and supplier records.  
• Analyze inefficiencies in procurement approvals  – Identify delays, redundancies, and 
inconsistencies in government purchasing processes.  
• Assess AI readiness and integration potential  – Determine the feasibility of integrating AI into 
federal procurement systems.  
3. Technology & Infrastructure Requirements  
• AI-powered anomaly detection systems  – Machine learning models for identifying suspicious 
spending patterns.  
• Cloud-based procurement monitoring platforms  – Centralized AI dashboards to oversee federal 
spending in real time.  
• Natural Language Processing (NLP) for contract analysis  – AI scanning procurement 
documents to detect inconsistencies.  
• Blockchain for supply chain transparency  – Immutable tracking of goods and services to 
prevent fraud and ensure accountability.  


• Predictive analytics for procurement optimization  – AI-driven models forecasting spending 
needs and supply chain risks.  
• Automated fraud detection pipelines  – AI workflows to flag high -risk transactions before they 
are processed.  
4. Data Strategy  
• Integrate procurement data across federal agencies  – Unifying spending records for AI -
powered cross -agency oversight.  
• Develop an AI -driven price benchmarking database  – Comparing government purchases with 
private sector pricing.  
• Enhance AI -powered vendor risk assessments  – Cross-referencing supplier records with fraud 
watchlists.  
• Automate contract compliance monitoring  – AI flagging contract deviations and unauthorized 
modifications.  
• Ensure real -time procurement data validation  – Preventing erroneous or fraudulent transactions 
before payments are made.  
5. Governance & Ethics  
• Establish AI -driven procurement oversight committees  – Ensuring AI implementation aligns 
with ethical and legal standards.  
• Enhance transparency in government spending  – Making AI -powered procurement audits 
accessible to relevant watchdog agencies.  
• Ensure compliance with federal procurement laws  – Aligning AI tools with the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and agency -specific policies.  
• Mitigate AI bias risks  – Regularly auditing AI models to prevent unfair vendor blacklisting or 
false fraud accusations.  
6. Workforce & Training  
• Train procurement officers in AI fraud detection  – Educating agency officials on how AI 
enhances procurement oversight.  
• Hire AI specialists in federal supply chain management  – Recruiting data scientists to build and 
maintain AI procurement tools.  


• Develop AI -powered decision support tools  – Providing user -friendly dashboards for 
procurement analysts and auditors.  
• Establish continuous learning programs  – Keeping federal agencies updated on AI -driven best 
practices in procurement monitoring.  
7. Implementation Roadmap  
 
Phase 1 (0 -12 Months)  
• Develop AI pilot programs  for procurement fraud detection in high -spending agencies (DoD, 
DHS, HHS, etc.).  
• Launch AI -powered supplier risk assessment models  to identify overpricing and fraud risks.  
• Integrate AI -driven price benchmarking tools  to compare government purchases with industry 
standards.  
• Establish an AI Procurement Oversight Task Force  to guide implementation.  
 
Phase 2 (1 -3 Years) 
• Expand AI -driven contract monitoring  across all federal procurement agencies.  
• Deploy real -time AI transaction monitoring dashboards  for spending oversight.  
• Enhance AI -powered supply chain risk assessments  to detect vendor manipulation and 
geopolitical threats.  
• Strengthen AI -driven procurement forecasting models  to optimize spending.  
 
Phase 3 (3 -5 Years) 
• Fully integrate AI into federal procurement systems  for automated fraud detection and contract 
validation.  
• Develop public -facing AI transparency reports  on government spending efficiency.  
• Establish AI -powered continuous monitoring  for government contracts and supplier 
performance.  


• Implement blockchain -based procurement tracking  for full supply chain visibility.  
8. Risk Management
