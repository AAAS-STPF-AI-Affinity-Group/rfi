General Comment
AI is not a savior, it is not intelligent, itâ€™s hardly anything at all besides theft. OpenAI and all other com panies should be held responsible
for the content theft they engage in to m ake their products, to say nothing of the environm ental im pact. These com panies should not be
allowed im m unity from  copyright claim s.
