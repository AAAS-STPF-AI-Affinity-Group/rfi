General Comment
The generative AI m odels used by the likes of Open AI are fundam entally flawed at the core, since they are trained on stolen, copyrighted
work that they had no rights to use. It cannot exist without stealing from  artists, journalists, writers, etc. If left unchecked, this hurts
everyone, and invalidates the law of copyright, setting an extrem ely dangerous precedent. Please regulate this tech before it is too late.
