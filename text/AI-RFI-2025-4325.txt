General Comment
Generative AI is of no use to hum anity. It creates inaccurate guesses based on what it thinks the m ost likely outcom e is from  the m odels it
is trained on. These AI training datasets consist of vast swaths of copyrighted m aterial stolen from  individuals without their content,
scraped by AI com panies from  the Internet without prejudice. AI "art" uses works stolen from  hum an beings to create unappealing
sim ulacrum s and is em ployed by corporations who don't want to pay creative talents for their work. Com panies are em ploying generative
AI to generate content and decision-m aking m odels in order to slash Am erican jobs in pursuit of profit. The m arketing hype around
generative AI is contributing to e-waste and pollution, and the current focus on generative AI harm s legitim ate uses of analytical AI such as
cancer research. I am  asking the Federal governm ent to regulate generative AI out of existence.
