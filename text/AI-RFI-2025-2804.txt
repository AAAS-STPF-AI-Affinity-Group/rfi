General Comment
The idea of skipping Am ericans's rights to consent to having anything of theirs used to train AI is an absolute disgrace to everything this
country stands for. The basic dignity of publicly existing being scraped to forge their soulless replacem ent, whether in life, art, or career
represents everything wrong with the current trajectory of our nation.
Any and all content used to train AI m ust be, as an aspect of law, accom panied by publicly accountable, legally verifiable consent from
that data's original creator and subject(s), and any AI that exists without the full, verifiable consent of every hum an being whose work,
words, or very being were utilized in its creation and evolution should not be allowed to exist in our country, or at all.
