General Comment
The theft of copyrighted works for the sake of AI, which has proven to be alm ost entirely socially and environm entally destructive, is
unjust. People should be fairly com pensated for the use of their copyrighted works. People should also not be subjected to the whim s of
big tech com panies with no recourse, especially when their interests do not align.
