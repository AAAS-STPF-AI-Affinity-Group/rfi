Integral AI is at the forefront of developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through 
pioneering innovations in brain-inspired architectures, lifelong and continual learning 
algorithms, world models, abstraction learning, reasoning and planning, and robotics. 
Our innovations provide the foundation for reliable, scalable, aligned, and beneficial AGI 
that advances both national and global prosperity. 
We believe the arrival of AGI presents an unparalleled strategic opportunity to solidify 
America’s global leadership, advance national economic prosperity, and ensure global 
benefit, if—and only if—managed effectively. 
To navigate the complex challenges and immense opportunities ahead, we propose a 
comprehensive framework for ensuring AGI is safe, reliable, aligned, and economically 
beneficial—without stifling innovation through excessive regulation. 
Framework for AGI Safety, Alignment, and Prosperity 
This framework outlines key pillars for safely developing and deploying AGI, ensuring 
alignment at several levels, safeguarding against misuse, and maximizing broad-based 
prosperity. 
1. Reliability and Robustness (Behavioral Alignment)
AGI systems must exhibit robust reliability and predictable behavior, mitigating 
hallucinations, errors, and unintended behaviors that could compromise real-world 
operations. 
Approach: ●Predictive World Models: Equip AGI with robust internal simulations to reason
about potential consequences of planned actions, including novel or uncertain
scenarios.
●Quantitative Uncertainty Estimation: Implement dynamic self-assessment so the
system can flag operations with low confidence, enabling human intervention
when needed.●Continual Growth: Continuously expand and train models using newly acquired
data, ensuring up-to-date knowledge and resilience against drift or adversarial
inputs.
Benchmarks: 
●Accuracy in predicting real-world scenarios over varying time horizons.
●Calibration of uncertainty estimation against empirical outcomes.
●Robustness metrics against adversarial attacks and unintended behavior.

2. Transparency and Auditability of AI Decisions (Developer Alignment) 
Transparency is critical for trust, auditability, and accountability. Integral AI advocates for 
interpretability methods that do not restrict innovation yet ensure oversight capability. 
Approach: 
● Transparent using explainable AI techniques leaveraging in mechanistic 
interpretability and the ability to inspect the models reasoning and planning 
process. 
● Continuous auditable logs of model reasoning, decisions, and justifications for 
significant actions. 
Benchmarks: 
● Ability for third-party auditors to reconstruct AI reasoning steps from logged 
actions. 
● Verifiability and explainability of decisions that have substantial societal or 
individual impacts. 
3. Alignment with Human Intent (Individual Alignment) 
To reliably execute human instructions and mitigate unintended consequences, AGI 
must faithfully model and adhere to human intentions. 
Approach: 
● Deploy AGI models capable of reasoning about intended instructions, proactively 
identifying unintended or unforeseen consequences. 
● Establish world models capable of quantifying uncertainty to inform safe 
autonomous planning, particularly in critical or novel environments. 
Benchmarks: 
● Performance of AGI models on complex instruction-following tasks, with 
measurement of deviations from explicitly stated human intentions. 
● Effectiveness in predicting and mitigating unintended consequences, measured 
through simulated scenarios involving novel tasks or unforeseen events. 
4. Energy-Efficient and Scalable AGI (Resource Alignment) 
Scalable AGI must be energy-efficient, drawing inspiration from biological neural 
computation. 
Approach: 
● Prioritize computational and data efficiency, enabling deployment without 
excessive infrastructure demands.

●Innovate in efficient learning architectures inspired by neuroscience, reducing
operational costs.
Benchmarks: 
●Computational performance per energy unit, benchmarked against human
brain-level efficiency.
●Scalability metrics demonstrating effectiveness of AGI at large-scale deployment
without linear increases in resource demands.
5. National Security and Strategic Advantage (National Alignment)
Recognizing AGI as a cornerstone of America’s strategic competitiveness, we advocate 
securing its responsible development and deployment without imposing unnecessary 
restrictions or hindering innovation. Ensuring national security through AGI requires a 
nuanced, balanced approach rather than heavy-handed regulation or overly restrictive 
policies. 
Approach: ●Foster robust cybersecurity practices and safeguard AGI systems against
adversarial misuse, espionage, or sabotage.
●Encourage voluntary, efficient industry-government information-sharing channels
designed to foster cooperation.
Benchmarks: 
●Evaluation of AGI companies resilience against cyber and physical threats
through regular penetration testing, red-teaming exercises, and scenario
simulations involving adversarial threats.●Capability of AGI systems to autonomously detect, respond to, and neutralize
adversarial misuse attempts in real-time scenarios.
6. Common-Sense Moral Alignment (Universal Alignment)
AI should adhere to objective "common-sense" values, consistent with America’s 
pragmatic tradition, rather than subjective moral doctrines. 
Approach: 
●We propose a metric termed collective agency, defined by capabilities in
understanding, morally competent decision-making, ability to realize intent
effectively, and sustainability or reversibility of actions.
●This ensures alignment at a universal level, preventing misuse and promoting
actions aligned with common human values without imposing ideological
conformity.

Benchmarks: 
●Model accuracy in evaluating actions against the collective agency metric.
●Ability of AGI to mediate conflicting human requests based on objective
common-sense alignment scores, demonstrating prioritization consistent with
enhancing collective agency.
7. Protecting Information Integrity (Cultural Alignment)
AGI must not exacerbate cultural fragmentation or disrupt societal cohesion through 
misinformation or psychological manipulation. 
Approach: 
●Develop algorithms inherently resistant to manipulation, adversarial
misinformation campaigns, and cognitive exploitation.
●Ensure AI recommendation engines avoid polarization or biased filtering by
prioritizing balanced and verified information.
Benchmarks: 
●Resistance of AI systems to adversarial content generation and recommendation
manipulation.
●Ability of AGI to autonomously detect and mitigate misinformation spread across
digital platforms and social networks.
8. Shared Prosperity and Economic Inclusivity (Economic Alignment)
To avoid the pitfalls of earlier industrial disruptions, we propose fundamentally 
reimagining economic incentives and distribution mechanisms. 
Our economic framework, described comprehensively in “The Rise of 
Superintelligence”, emphasizes equitable distribution of AGI-generated prosperity, 
reflecting true value creation including externalities. 
Approach: ●Develop novel economic measures reflecting positive and negative externalities
(environmental, societal, cultural) created by AI-generated goods and services.
●Facilitate broad societal distribution of AGI-derived wealth, ensuring human
flourishing.
Benchmarks: 
●Economic inclusivity metrics demonstrating tangible improvement in shared
prosperity outcomes across diverse demographics.
●Externality pricing effectiveness benchmarks, evaluating alignment between
AGI-generated prosperity and societal flourishing metrics.

Preliminary Policy Recommendations 
The rapid advancement of AGI presents both opportunities and challenges that demand 
proactive, adaptive, and continuously evolving policy measures. The following 
preliminary recommendations highlight key areas where government-private sector 
collaboration is essential to ensuring AGI development remains secure, socially aligned,
