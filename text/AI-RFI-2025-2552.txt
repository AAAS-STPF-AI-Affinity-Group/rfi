General Comment
If you want to kill hum an creativity and critical thinking then support giving special exem ptions to LLM com panies. They want to steal
from  the creative econom y, repackage it through system s that they want us to pay for with taxes and then sell it back to us at a prem ium .
This is definitionally corruption at the national level.
