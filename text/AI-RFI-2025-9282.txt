General Comment
Don't let generative AI off the hook for copyright infringem ent. It needs to pay people for everything that's put into it.
And if that costs too m uch, m aybe the AI doesn't deserve to exist.
If this technology is useful, let it be proven in the free m arket, rather than com e begging for special perm ission to steal from  us.
