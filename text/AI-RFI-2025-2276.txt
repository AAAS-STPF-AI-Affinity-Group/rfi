General Comment
Gen AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) is absolutely horrible. Our current elected president is old and therefore doesn't actually care
about the im plications of how Gen AI will affect our country AND the environm ent; that is to say that the current president is effectively
senile and driven by m onetary gain and power.
If the course of action is to include Gen AI as a part of the governm ent, I im plore you to ask AI how m any "R"s are in "Strawberry". The
reason it doesn't work and is not accurate is due to the fact that Gen AI is an algorithm  that approxim ates and generalizes input data and
m akes GUESSES to provide an answer. Im ages that are generated are created by a m ultitude of im ages layered on top of one another to
sim ulate new concepts or visuals (hence, it is STEALING from  videos, artists, and photographers). Generative AI doesn't m ean it creates
som ething new, it m eans it's generating inform ation based on a catalogue of data it already has to approxim ate som ething "new" by im age
bashing and data sm ashing [1].
If Gen AI is added to the governm ent, sensitive data will be easily hackable, leaked, attained from  individuals outside of the m ain
governm ent offices. Foreign adversaries will be able to attain sensitive and privatized data, even up to and including any classified
docum ents that m ight be added to the Generative AI's m odel or breadth of search.
If that is not som ething you're worried about, then consider that it has a deep environm ental im pact. If the US Governm ent decides to
absorb Gen AI, you will be solely responsible for the drying up of lakes[2, 3, 4], dirtying of water[2, 3, 4], CO2 gas em issions[3], using
too m uch energy [3], fires caused by the warehouses (burning plastics, m etals, and other infrastructure) due to overheating and
spontaneous fires of the com puters running Gen AI, increasing tem peratures of the world, and m uch, m uch m ore. 
Please take tim e to actually consider how devastating adding Generative AI to the governm ent would actually be.
