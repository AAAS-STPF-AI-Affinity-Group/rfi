processes to deliver timely and effective solutions. 
Historical Successes in Rapid Adaptation 
Case Stu dy: Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Organization (JIDO) 
The Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Organization (JIDO), established 
during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, exemplifies the potential for 
rapid, user-driven response frameworks. Confronted with the 
challenge of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and explosively 
formed projectiles (EFPs), the DoD created JIDO to respond to these 
threats quickly and effectively. JIDO: 
● Created prototypes for countermeasures in direct response to warfighter feedback.
● Employed flexible funding to expedite solution testing, procurement, and deployment.
● Developed solutions that evolved from electronic countermeasures to innovations like
V-shaped hulls for increased vehicle survivability.
JIDO’s success was largely due to a highly responsive feedback loop, where warfighters 
provided insights that directly shaped technological advancem ents. 
●Agile and Iterative Development: JIDO implemented an agile methodology that
allowed rapid development and adaptation of counter-IED technologies and techniques.
This iterative development process, based on continuous evaluation and refinement,

dedicated experts from government, industry, and the military who brought diverse skills
and insights. Each organization within JIDO’s network served a distinct role, ensuring all
critical requirements—from technology development to field integration—were met in
one cohesive team. This team-based, multi-disciplinary approach enabled JIDO to
address every aspect of solution deployment, including research, engineering,
manufacturing, and logistics.
●Rapid Prototyping for Operational Solutions: Central to JIDO’s strategy was its ability
to rapidly develop, test, and deploy operational prototypes in the field. By focusing on
rapid prototyping, JIDO could create solutions that were not only innovative but also
practical for immediate operational use. This enabled the organization to produce
countermeasures that were both timely and adaptable, providing the warfighter with tools
that could meet the pace of evolving threats.
●Short Feedback Loops with End Users: JIDO’s framework prioritized continuous
communication with end users—soldiers and commanders actively engaged in combat.


This close feedback loop allowed JIDO to gain firsthand insights into the effectiveness of 
its solutions and make necessary adjustments. Direct input from the field informed rapid 
iterations and improvements, ensuring each prototype was honed based on real-world 
usage rather than theoretical assumptions. 
●Flexible Funding and Acquisition Processes: JIDO’s ability to access flexible funding
streams, often referred to as "colorless money," allowed it to move quickly and avoid the
lengthy budgeting cycles that typically hinder defense acquisition programs. This agile
funding model, combined with streamlined acquisition processes, ensured JIDO could
procure, develop, and deploy technologies without bureaucratic delays.
●Collaboration with Industry and Academia: JIDO actively engaged with industry and
academia to leverage cutting-edge innovations and research. By collaborating with
external partners, JIDO was able to accelerate development timelines, access new

The Ukrainian conflict provides another recent example, where the rapid adaptation of tactics, 
techniques, and technology has been critical in countering aggressive forces. This dynamic 
battlefield has underscored the need for timely intelligence, agile technological adaptation, and 
an AI ecosystem that enables rapid deployment. Emulating this adaptability through a 
framework informed by end-user data and real-time feedback is essential to ensuring 
preparedness in future conflicts.  
Direct and Continuous Feedback from End Users for User-Centered Design 
A critical component of the evolutionary model is the establishment of a robust 
and constant feedback mechanism directly from end users, which is already a 
core component within the DoD software acquisition pathway. This approach is 
essential for enabling user-centered design, prioritizing the needs and 
experiences of those who will be employing the technology in real-world 
scenarios. End users possess invaluable insights into the effectiveness of 
capabilities as they continuously evolve their tactics, techniques, and procedures 
in response to emerging battlefield threats. 
The integration of direct and iterative feedback into the software acquisition pathway allows for 
rapid adjustments and refinements to be made, ensuring that solutions are not only functional 
but also intuitive and user-friendly. This iterative nature contrasts sharply with traditional, 
slow-moving requirements generation processes that have historically struggled to keep pace 
with the speed and scale of operational needs. 
By fostering a culture of direct user engagement, organizations can ensure that the design and 
development processes align closely with the realities faced by warfighters. This 
responsiveness enables teams to identify gaps in capabilities more swiftly and accurately, 


leading to the creation of more effective and relevant solutions. Ultimately, this enhances 
mission success on the battlefield. 
Empowering end users to contribute their perspectives throughout the development cycle 
reinforces the adaptability of the evolutionary model. By integrating user feedback into the 
design process, the software acquisition pathway not only evolves in tandem with changing 
conditions but also improves the overall effectiveness of the technology being deployed. 
In summary, the inclusion of direct and additive feedback from end users is paramount to 
developing user-centered solutions within the software acquisition pathway, ensuring that the 
military can respond effectively and efficiently to challenges as they arise in an increasingly 
dynamic threat landscape. 
 Flexible Contracting and Budgeting Mechanisms for Rapid Iteration 
For an adaptive and responsive defense AI ecosystem to succeed, it must 
be underpinned by both flexible contracting mechanisms and a flexible 
budgeting process. Traditional PPBE processes, often rigid and 
slow-moving, cannot keep pace with the dynamic threat environment and the 
rapid evolution of technology. To address this, flexible mechanisms—such as 
Colorless money, Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs), Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs), 
and similar frameworks—are critical to enable the swift onboarding of new partners, 
technologies, and innovations. 
Flexible contracting models allow government organizations to bypass many traditional barriers 
in acquisition, expediting partnerships, developmental work, and access to advanced solutions. 
OTAs, for example, provide streamlined pathways for engaging with innovative tech firms and 
non-traditional defense contractors, which is essential for securing specialized expertise and 
addressing urgent capability gaps with emerging technologies. Through BOAs, organizations 
simplify ordering processes, ensuring they can quickly access a suite of pre-approved partners 
and solutions. This framework supports rapid scaling, enabling government teams to respond 
quickly to newly identified threats with the right mix of capabilities. 
Complementing these contracting mechanisms, a flexible budgeting process is equally crucial. 
Instead of the historical, often restrictive budget approach, a more adaptable funding strategy 
should be established to allow for dynamic reallocation of resources as threats evolve and new 
requirements emerge. With a flexible budget, agencies can quickly redirect funding to support 
high-priority areas, accelerate development cycles, and continuously refine technologies based 
on real-time needs. This approach ensures that funding can move at the speed of need, driving 
mission impact and facilitating rapid transitions from prototype to deployment. 
Together, flexible contracting and budgeting create a foundation for agile, iterative development 
cycles where capabilities can be rapidly prototyped, delivered as Minimum Viable Products 
(MVPs), and field-tested for end-user feedback. This feedback loop, supported by agile budget 
adjustments, enables continuous improvement and adaptation, ensuring that solutions are 


refined to meet real-world operational demands. The combined flexibility in contracting and 
budgeting mechanisms is essential for aggregating and responding to evolving threats 
dynamically. By supporting faster cycles of problem identification, MVP development, and 
iteration based on field feedback, this approach accelerates time-to-mission-impact, building a 
resilient, scalable AI ecosystem capable of addressing emerging challenges with precision and 
speed. 
Leveraging On-Premises, Private Cloud, and Secure Commercial Cloud 
Environments for Scalability and Cost Efficiency 
A critical element supporting the evolutionary model is the strategic use of 
on-premises infrastructure, approved commercial cloud environments, and / 
or hybrid architectures. This architectural approach enables organizations to manage costs 
effectively while maintaining access to the latest hardware, infrastructure scalability, and failover 
redundancies essential for rapid adaptation. By leveraging a hybrid environment that integrates 
on-premises and cloud resources, organizations can flexibly scale capabilities as needs evolve, 
ensuring the ability to support both short-term operations and long-term strategic goals. 
This approach also allows organizations to stay current with technological advancements, 
ensuring compatibility with the evolving marketplace of data and artificial intelligence (AI). 
On-premises solutions can provide secure, immediate access to data for sensitive workloads, 
while private and commercial cloud environments offer scalability and rapid processing power to 
support AI-driven insights and large-scale data operations. 
By balancing the strengths of on-premises and cloud resources, organizations can maximize 
both cost-efficiency and adaptability, enabling continuous improvement in data handling, AI 
integration, and infrastructure resilience. This flexibility is essential in today’s environment, 
where an evolving threat landscape requires rapid innovation and robust data-driven solutions. 
Rapid Validation and Deployment of Software Solutions 
A crucial component of this adaptive framework is the capability 
to rapidly assess, validate, and deploy software solutions using a 
continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) 
pipeline. This approach, combined with secure sandbox 
environments, enables the government to validate software 
performance and reliability using real-world data within a 
protected environment. Through these mechanisms, 
decision-makers can gain high-fidelity insights into how solutions will perform operationally, 
allowing for data-informed decisions paired with rapid deployment into live operational networks. 


The CI/CD pipeline and sandbox environments facilitate a streamlined 
process in which software updates, iterative improvements, and new 
features can be delivered continuously. This agile approach enables a 
responsive cycle for integrating software into operational systems, 
achieving immediate mission impact without the delays typically 
associated with traditional software rollouts. Furthermore, these 
environments allow for continuous cybersecurity monitoring and threat 
mitigation, enhancing the resilience and security of deployed solutions. 
This methodology has proven successful at scale within the U.S. 
intelligence community. For example, the National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) Unclassified Data Lake and 
JIDO's Attack the Network suite have demonstrated how these methodologies can validate, 
enhance, and deploy mission-critical software at the speeds required. These initiatives leverage 
real-world data 
in secure 
settings to 
simulate 
operational use, 
accelerating the 
fielding of 
software 
solutions that 
directly support 
mission 
requirements. 
This ability to 
deploy rapidly, 
paired with  
iterative updates informed by continuous feedback, is essential to maintaining a technological 
edge and responding at the speed of evolving threats. 
Rapid Adoption and Integration of New Hardware with Edge AI 
Capabilities 
A vital component of this adaptive framework is the ability to quickly adopt, 
integrate, and deploy new hardware components, particularly for use in edge 
environments and Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) 
situations. Such environments are prevalent in intelligence and special 
operations, where maintaining operational effectiveness despite challenging 
connectivity conditions is paramount. Integrating hardware with 
complementary software solutions—and increasingly, with artificial intelligence 
(AI) capabilities—enables rapid, data-driven decision-making in the field. 


The Army’s Common Hardware Systems (CHS) contract methodology provides a streamlined 
approach to access a diverse array of ruggedized COTS, field-tested hardware solutions 
through a prime integrator. This access enables government teams to quickly procure validated 
hardware that meets rigorous military standards, supporting swift deployment and reducing 
procurement timelines. Through CHS, agencies can adapt and deliver hardware optimized for 
military environments, offering the durability and reliability needed in high-stakes scenarios. 
As the scale and capability of AI continues to advance, the availability of high-performance 
GPUs is essential to enabling AI models to operate effectively on edge devices. This 
advancement is particularly important as AI models are developed to support various 
warfighting functions, including real-time threat analysis, reconnaissance, and autonomous 
decision-making. By deploying AI-enabled hardware on the edge, operators gain immediate 
access to insights and capabilities that enhance situational awareness, support mission-critical 
functions, and enable autonomous responses in real-time. 
The combination of advanced, DDIL-resilient hardware and edge-capable AI models creates an 
adaptive, self-sustaining AI ecosystem that allows for continuous improvements. This approach 
maximizes the impact of AI and other data-driven technologies on the battlefield, supporting 
both immediate and long-term operational effectiveness. The integration of these solutions 
through agile, continuous pipelines is essential for achieving mission outcomes at the speed of 
evolving threats. 
Testing and Evaluation as Drivers of Evidence-Based Capability Adoption 
A crucial element of this evolutionary model is the role of testing and evaluation in 
driving evidence-based, data-informed capability adoption. To be effective, rapid 
developmental and operational testing, by end users, must validate new 
capabilities swiftly and accurately, reducing the risks associated with deploying 
unverified solutions. This rigorous testing approach ensures that only capabilities 
meeting mission needs and end-user requirements advance to fielding, allowing 
for practical and reliable solutions in real-world environments. 
However, the success of this approach relies on test organizations that are not only thorough 
but also highly responsive. To avoid the delays often seen in traditional acquisition processes, 
these organizations must be able to plan and execute well-formed test events in a timely 
manner. This agility enables a smoother pathway from capability development to deployment, 
ensuring that testing complements rather than slows the pace of innovation. 
In this framework, procurement decisions can also be informed by evidence-based testing 
outcomes through independent test organizations. By grounding acquisition in 
performance-based evidence, these assessments reduce reliance on claims from proposals 
alone, thus lowering the risk of adopting impractical or unsuitable solutions. This streamlined 


testing and evaluation process supports the agile fielding of viable, mission-capable capabilities 
that can adapt to changing operational needs and threats.

Adoption and Utilization of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence 
Models for Enhanced Decision-Making 
One of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) most pressing challenges 
today lies in the sheer volume and complexity of data that is constantly 
expanding. The current human analytical workforce is unable to ingest, 
correlate, and interpret this information fast enough to fully “sense and 
make sense” of the operational environment. With the rapid 
development of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, particularly those 
geared towards identifying and tracking threat actors globally, the DoD 
must be prepared to assess, validate, and deploy AI models that can 
effectively augment human analysts and enable more informed 
operational decisions.

To adapt to the data demands of today’s environment, the DoD needs to integrate a range of 
multimodal AI models that can manage, analyze, and fuse diverse data types—both structured 
and unstructured. This approach will enhance decision-making, situational awareness, and 
operational responsiveness across strategic and tactical domains. AI’s role is to “sense and 
make sense” of vast, complex information landscapes, providing military and defense leaders 
with actionable insights at a speed and accuracy unattainable by human-only processes. 
Ensuring AI Transparency, Adaptability, and Scalability: 
For these AI models to be trusted and effective, transparency and explainability are essential to 
help decision-makers trust and understand the insights AI provides. Adaptability is also 
critical—AI models must evolve with changing data patterns and threat landscapes. Success 
depends on secure access to data, pathways for rapid fine-tuning and iterative updates, and 
continuously modernized infrastructure that can accommodate ongoing advancements in AI. 
AI-Driven Evolutionary Model for Real-Time Responsiveness: 
The DoD’s evolving needs must be met with a similarly adaptive, AI-enabled model. The current 
AI landscape has demonstrated processing speeds and efficiencies that surpass traditional 
methods by factors of tens or even hundreds of thousands. By establishing an evolutionary 
model enabled by AI, the DoD can leverage continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) 
pipelines, continuous authority to operate (cATO), and cloud-based infrastructures, ensuring a 
flexible, secure, and scalable foundation to manage these expanding data and computational 
demands.
