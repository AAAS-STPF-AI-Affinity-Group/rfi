General Comment
Generative AI has no place here; It com m its thousands of counts of copyright infringem ent and spits out unim aginative, m essy slop. It's
inaccurate, dangerous m isinform ation on the cheap. It doesn't know anything it talks about or creates, so it can sound com pletely
confident and also be com pletely incorrect. It's a glorified scam . Please do not give the AI m odels, or its creators, any clearance or benefit
of the doubt.
