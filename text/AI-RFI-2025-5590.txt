General Comment
AI does not have a place in the United States' future. Corporations are asking for this to go through only so they can profit from  the
people they would be stealing from . OpenAI saying this is a national security m easure is their attem pt at fearm ongering. AI has a negative
reputation that is only growing given its presence in ads is enough to tell people the product is not worth using, buying, and so on. If the
current adm inistration wishes to fight for the Am erican citizens that they represent, they will not give OpenAI and any other AI com panies
im m unity to lawsuits involving copyright infringem ent.
