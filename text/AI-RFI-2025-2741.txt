General Comment
Letting this bill past will m ean the extinction of hum an driven creative works, As a result this will cause dram atic decline to the econom y as
people will no longer be able to reliably m ake a living off their own work as a hum an if a m achine will just do the work. Not to m ention the
flood gates this will open in term s of civilian safety, such as evidence being forged to m ake an individual seem  that they com m itted a crim e
or act that they did not do. Even worse the possibility if said evidence is used in a court of law. I am  begging you to strike down this bill
lest it ruins the United States, all to satisfy a handful of corporations.
