General Comment
I am  an anim ation and com ics professional of nearly ten years. As generative AI rocketed into the m ainstream , I have watched m ine and
m y colleague's work fed into places like OpenAI with zero regulations or perm issions. The m ajority of the tv shows and film s I've worked
on are geared towards children, and with AI it has been used to flood social m edia with hate speech, nazi propaganda, and harm ful
inform ation, all while looking and sounding like the official works they've stolen from .
These big tech com panies scrape the internet for art that doesn't belong to them  and don't care who it hurts. As an artist I work hard to
put forth stories I can be proud of, to share with the world, inspire and grow com m unity. But all these AI system s do is harm  sm all
businesses, steal likenesses of perform ers, and scam  the public. 
Do not let these com panies continue to profit from  art they did not create. We need Am erican copyright laws to protect us from  predatory
com panies, so that we can continue with actual innovation in the arts, sciences and technology. Do not create new copyright exem ptions
that allow Big Tech com panies to exploit and steal from  creators and everyday Am ericans without perm ission, com pensation, or
transparency.
Thank you for your tim e.
