General Comment
As a software engineer, I can guarantee with absolute certainty that we have nothing m eaningful to gain by bending the knee to AI
salesm en. Certain types of AI are incredibly useful - but those are not the kind of AI that require exceptions punched into copyright law.
Discovering new m echanism s for protein synthesis or diagnosing cancer are fundam entally different from  putting your face into an
advertisem ent; not because of the underlying m athem atics, but because of the data sets involved. 
And as a creator, the notion of changing copyright law to cater to AI is sickening. If a business m odel can't thrive due to the laws in
place... that m eans the business is crim e. And the only types of AI that need these exceptions are, again, the kind that cheapen creative
works and prom ise to give big businesses free "labor" when they can afford otherwise. How is your life im proved by Hollywood
synthesizing the im age or voice of an actor? How is your life im proved by Facebook inserting your likeness into advertisem ents? How is
your life im proved by Hasbro using janky AI im ages on trading cards instead of paying an artist? That's who you em power by even
considering waiving regulations here; it's not you, it's not m e, it's not 99% of Am ericans.
