General Comment
AI com panies should be held to sam e standards of copyright as all citizens and com panies in this country. That they feel their m odels
won't be able to com pete without being able to freely hoover up any and all inform ation is a problem  of scope. The m odels and uses for
this technology all have m uch m ore narrowly defined scope. By allowing AI com panies unrestricted access, you devalue work of all artists
and writers in this country and will harm  everyone.
