General Comment
GENERATIVE AI is a waste of tim e and energy, it can't even do anything that a person with 1/100 of the energy consum ption and a
couple hours worth of practice can do better and m ore entertainingly. It's a big waste of space and tim e to look m ildly average which is
pretty lackluster to be backing, especially since it's probably gonna be used to m ake m ildly juvenile videos of politicians kissing each other
or stealing from  7/11.
