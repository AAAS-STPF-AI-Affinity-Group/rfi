General Comment
AI will not lead to a brighter future in it's current state - specifically the state being referenced here - allowing com panies to freely steal is
going to be the least of the concerns. And it is a concern, frankly, but m ore than that AI, generative AI as is being spoken of here, is
already leading to a loss of skill within hum ans.
It will not better Am erica, it will cripple us technologically and globally.
