General Comment
AI does not have a place in the future of Am erica -- especially in a context where we will essentially be allowing them  to ignore copyright
law. It is a fad, like m any pushed by the tech bubble, that will pop again. AI in its current form  is bad for the environm ent, bad for the
worker, and bad for Am erica. Do not let this happen.
