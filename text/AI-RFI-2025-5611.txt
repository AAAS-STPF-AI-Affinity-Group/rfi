General Comment
Absolutely do not give OPEN AI this access. They should not be allowed to legally steal copyrighted works from  people just because
their terrible business plan requires m ass theft to work.
If any other business required begging the governm ent to let them  steal supplies they would be laughed out. What they have done is stolen
the work of tens of thousands if not m illions of people to try to sell it back to them  and destroy the jobs of people who actually put in the
effort to hone their craft.
If you want to see m ore videos of the president licking elon's feet m ore power to you. You'll get so m any m ore if you give this to them .
