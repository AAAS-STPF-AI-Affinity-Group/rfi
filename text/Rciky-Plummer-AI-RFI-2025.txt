Strategic AI Action Plan for Sustaining U.S. AI Dominance -DOMINATE AI  
DOMINATE -AI: Developing O pportunities for M aintaining I nnovation, N urturing A dvanced 
Technology and E xcellence in AI
America's leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) is a cornerstone of economic competitiveness, nationa
l security, and technological progress. As global rivals invest heavily in AI – China has 
declared its aim to lead the world in AI by 2030 – the United States must take bold, strategic actions to maintain its edge. This AI Action Plan  outlines priority policy steps to strengthen U.S. 
AI capabilities while avoiding overregulation that could stifle innovation. By focusing on core infrastructure, talent an d R&D, responsible governance, and partnerships, the U.S. can foster AI 
advancement in the private sector and public sector alike. The goal is to create a flourishing AI ecosystem that drives economic growth and protects national security, without burdening innovators with unnecessary red tape. 
The stakes of this competition cannot be overstated. AI is not merely another technological 
domain but a foundational capability that will reshape industries, redefine military advantage, and potentially reconfigure global power structures. Nations that ma ster AI will enjoy 
unprecedented economic benefits through productivity gains, new industries, and technological breakthroughs. They will also possess decisive advantages in military capabilities, intelligence gathering, and critical infrastructure resilie nce. The first -mover advantages in AI development 
are substantial, as leadership creates self -reinforcing cycles of talent attraction, data 
accumulation, and computing resource concentration. 
The United States currently holds significant advantages in AI research, talent, and commercial 
applications. However, this lead is not guaranteed to persist without coordinated policy action. China's whole-of-nation approach to AI development, backed by s ubstantial state investments 
and a strategic vision extending decades into the future, presents a formidable challenge. Other nations including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and South Korea are also making significant investments in AI capabilities. The time for strategic action is now – before competitive advantages are eroded and opportunities for establishing durable U.S. leadership are lost. 
This plan – D eveloping Opportunities for M aintaining I nnovation, N urturing A dvanced 
Technology and E xcellence in AI ( DOMINATE -AI) – represents a comprehensive blueprint for 
securing America's position at the forefront of the global AI revolution.  


It is organized into three major sections: 
1.Priority Policy Actions  – The seven highest- impact initiatives that should be undertaken
immediately to secure U.S. AI leadership.
2.Strategic Guiding Principles  – The core philosophies that should shape all U.S.
government actions related to AI development and governance.
3.Key Policy Areas and Recommendations  – Detailed recommendations across fifteen
critical domains, from hardware infrastructure to international engagement.
By implementing this ambitious yet achievable agenda, the United States can ensure that the 
most powerful technology of our era develops in alignment with American values, interests, and leadership.  
Priority Policy Actions (By Impact) 
To secure America's AI dominance, certain policy actions stand out as having the highest impact on U.S. technological leadership, economic vitality, and security. These top priorities should be pursued immediately: 
1.Reinvigorate Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing : Invest in U.S. chip fabrication
capacity for AI. Expand funding (e.g. >$30B) to build state-of-the-art semiconductor fabsand incentivize R&D in advanced AI chips. Reducing reliance on foreign chip supplierswill safeguard the "engines" of AI innovation and protect supply chains.
2.Double Federal AI R&D Funding : Dramatically increase AI research investments
through NSF, DARPA, DOE and others. A national commission called for doubling non-defense AI R&D to $36 billion by 2026. This investment will spur breakthroughs,support academic and industry labs, and ensure the U.S. remains the global hub of AIadvancements.
3.Establish a National AI Strategy and Leadership Council : Create a high -level White
House-led council (akin to a Technology Competitiveness Council) to develop andimplement a comprehensive national AI strategy. This ensures coordinated efforts acrossgovernment agencies, aligning R&D, workforce, regulatory, and security initiatives undera unified vision for AI leadership.
4.Build the AI Talent Pipeline : Address the AI workforce shortage by launching
ambitious education and immigration initiatives. Establish a U.S. Digital Service
Academy and National AI Reserve Corps to train AI practitioners for government. Pass a
"National Defense Education Act II" to  fund STEM scholarships in AI fields. Streamline
visas to attract top international AI talent. Human capital is the bedrock of innovation.
5.Adopt Light -Touch, Risk-Focused Regulation : Avoid heavy-handed AI regulations
that could hamstring innovation. Instead, focus on mitigating clear, demonstrable harms


(e.g. safety -critical failures, fraudulent misuse) and use a risk -based approach. Current 
evidence does not support broad restrictions on AI models, especially open- source 
models. Policymakers should target real threats while enabling experimentation and 
growth. 
6.Promote Public- Private Partnerships in AI : Leverage collaboration between
government, industry, and academia for AI development. For example, co-invest in AItestbeds and innovation centers, expand NSF's AI Institutes to 30 or more nationwide,and launch joint ventures in areas like AI for healthcare, cybersecurity, and climate.These partnerships will accelerate deployment of AI solutions and ensure critical sectorsbenefit from AI.
7.Protect National Security with AI Leadership : Integrate AI into defense and
intelligence to outpace adversaries. Dedicate at least 3.4% of the DoD budget to scienceand technology (with $8B+ annually for AI R&D). Rapidly field AI applications in areaslike intelligence analysis, autonomous systems, and cyber defense – guided by ethicalprinciples – to maintain a strategic military advantage. Strengthen export controls to denyadversaries the most advanced AI chips and tools.
Strategic Approach: Guiding Principles  
Achieving these goals requires a strategic approach that balances support and oversight. The following principles will guide U.S. AI policy implementation: 
•Foster Innovation through Deregulation (When Appropriate) : The government will
favor light-touch regulatory frameworks that do not unnecessarily hinder AI research andentrepreneurship. Instead of rigid rules, agencies will issue flexible guidance andvoluntary standards to address risks. This approach encourages agile development in theprivate sector and lets beneficial AI applications reach the market faster.
•Public -Private Partnerships : Collaboration is key to advancing AI. Federal agencies
will partner with tech companies, startups, universities, and non- profits to share expertise
