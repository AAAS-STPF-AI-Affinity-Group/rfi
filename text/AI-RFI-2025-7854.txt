General Comment
I am  a citizen and artist from  Michigan. "Private sector AI innovation" doesn't concern m e in the slightest, but the livelihood of hum an
creators does. GenAI, LLMs, and AI graphics are stealing business from  Am erican creators and killing jobs. This isn't like industrialization
where m ore efficient m ethods m attered and im proved quality of life. It is actually a net negative to our way of life because it introduces
falsehoods ("hallucinations") that m ust be m anually corrected or, often, are taken as real regardless of the potential hazards of believing
som ething that cannot actually think. If private sector AI is given free rein to take in copyrighted m aterial, expect hum an creators to stop
sharing their works. This is exactly what copyright exists to protect against.
