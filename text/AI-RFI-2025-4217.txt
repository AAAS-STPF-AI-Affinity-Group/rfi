General Comment
I absolutely do not, in any way, support the governm ent endorsing AI of any kind. I will not condone the destruction of Am erican industry
and Am ericans' rights to own their intellectual property. Nor will I condone our governm ent allowing foreign actors to utilize this tool to
spread m isinform ation that will underm ine this great country. Say no to this AI action plan.
