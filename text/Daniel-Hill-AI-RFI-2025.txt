AI has failed to demonstrate any acceptable use without fair compensation and safety. It
should not be prioritized until it has done so.
Any policy must prioritize compensation of original creators and copyright holders over model builders. Training
must Be accompanied with an attestation of the right to use said material for that purpose.
Any policy for image and multimedia must prioritize safety to children and privacy over access to generation
technology. Safeguards against involuntary pornography must be in place.
Academic and managerial assistants must prioritize and achieve accuracy before being used in any advisory role.
See the mistakes in legal bots and medical advice engines that are already afflicting the courts and our lives.
Without this, AI is less than useless. It is actively harmful.Dan Hill
