General Comment
Training for Generative AI m odels m ust respect current copyright laws in order to protect IP holders and their creations. Training on
copyrighted m aterial without proper consent from  the copyright holder is a clear violation of copyright law.
While I am  for the rem oval of unnecessary burdens and regulations in order to let the innovation of the technology sector flourish, I also do
not want to see the hard work and protections of IP holders be violated for the sake of Generative AI. A proper solution to the training
m odel issue would be to require AI com panies to provide their own training datasets--in other words--hire a team  and go out to take
photos in the field or pay volunteers to m ake contributions to your datasets.
