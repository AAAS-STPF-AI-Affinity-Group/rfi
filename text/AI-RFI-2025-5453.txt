General Comment
There are no national security im plications of am erican ai com panies paying for the content they use and not being able to use content from
others without consent. The com panies sim ply do not want to do it. They are not com petitive - that’s their problem . Perhaps they need
new leadership.
In any event, honest and hard working am erican writers, artists, et al are harm ed by their m arkets being flooded with cheap im itation
content that is derived from  their own stolen work. Com panies like OpenAI propose to steal from  artists and writers so that they can sell
a com peting product. It’s like stealing food from  a restaurant kitchen and then selling it on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant- and
that’s a charitable com parison!
It’s also worth m entioning that all of these LLM com panies are hem orrhaging m oney - even while they are not paying for copyrighted
work! They have had years to m ake m oney while stealing copyrighted work and they can’t do it. Their product doesn’t do what they
prom ise and they can’t m ake it without stealing from  people. This isn’t hard to figure out. Do not give these com panies a free pass to steal.
They have to pay for the m aterials they need like any other business - including legit national security contractors.
