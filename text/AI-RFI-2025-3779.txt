General Comment
AI Com panies should not be able to have their AI function by stealing copyrightable m aterials. On a basic level, If AI com panies were to
steal from  copyrightable m aterials without consequence, then they would be able to profit off of som eone else's legal work. On a m ore
com plicated level, this only serves to devalue art and inform ation. It devalues art by m aking som ething "good enough" for individuals,
com panies or team s to use instead of the work of any hard-working artist that took the tim e to hone their craft. The sam e goes for
inform ation, as getting inform ation from  any search site like Google Chrom e or Microsoft Edge will force their AI answers first, leading to
potentially incorrect inform ation. Worse than all of that, however, is the increasingly disastrous consequence of endangering national
security as a result of using copyrightable m aterials for the im provem ent of their program s. AI as of now, has been used to deepfake
videos, content, and inform ation about various people and historical events and im proving the functionality of these program s will only
m ake it worse in the long run by m aking it easier to m ake slanderous, defam atory and endangering art of people like the President him self,
m aking realistic depictions of things that he didn't do, or videos of things he never did or lies that he never told and all of that will,
ironically, m ake the "fake news" that Trum p has rallied against for alm ost a decade.
