General Comment
This action plan is a gross overreach and an extrem e violation of Am erican rights and laws. It will underm ine decades of hard work of
thousands of Am ericans. It is theft to an extrem e and frankly disgusting degree, and will seriously harm  the work, incom e and business of
individuals, sm all businesses, and corporate entities all. What this action plan proposes is illegal, and will do nothing but cause severe harm
to working Am ericans, and to the econom y.
