General Comment
I am  an associated com m issioner to a plethora of individual sm all business-owners in the digital graphic art space. Alm ost all of these
individuals face som e form  of econom ic harm  caused to them  by the illegal use of their artworks by Generative AI algorithm s, and that
harm  is felt every day. Allowing Big Tech to further scrape copyrighted works in their algorithm s will CAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM
TO THE ENTIRE GRAPHIC ART INDUSTRY. We MUST follow our CURRENT LAWS to protect the stability of one of Am erica's
m ost cherished creative industries.
