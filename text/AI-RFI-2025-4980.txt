General Comment
Allowing special exceptions to corporate owned AI training is a flagrant and unacceptable attack on the copyright protections enjoyed by
m illions of Am ericans to use their own innovations and business opportunities.
It is theft by crooked actors trying to use socialist actions to steal the hard work and rights of the people by claim ing special rights to other
peoples work, enriching them selves while denying hardworking Am ericans of the fruits of their own honest labor!
