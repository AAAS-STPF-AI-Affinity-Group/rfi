General Comment
Giving the com panies behind Ai legal im m unity over their product is a dangerous precedence to set. Considering Ai steals peoples data
create things like Accurate im ages and voice sounds. People legally are granted the right to legal recourse should a product, especially one
they did not consent to have in their lives, were to harm  them .
