Generative AI companies operate by scraping information from the open web. In doing such and then turning
around and attempting to profit off of their AI's they are stealing the work of other people without permission orcompensation.
This represents an unacceptable breach of the social contract towards writers, artists, and other individuals who
create the "content" that companies like OpenAI steal for profit. This abandons the core pronciples that ones ownefforts should be rewarded and that those who act like parasites and leech off of the hard work of others should beprosecuted and stopped from causing direct economic harm to others.
If I have to follow copyright law when I am producing works like books and music, then OpenAI has to follow the
law too.
Do not allow generative AI companies to bypass the law.Sincerely,--A concerned US citizen.________________________________All e-mails to and from this account are for NITRD official use only and subject to certain disclosure requirements.
