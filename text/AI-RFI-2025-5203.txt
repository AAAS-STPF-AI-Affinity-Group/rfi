General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
AI isn't really artificial intelligence but a False equivalent,
If you want to destroy the rich hum an culture and history Ai would be the path to that,
It has overtly nefarious purposes. 
and AI has the extrem e potential to be used in ways to hurt the billionaire class beyond belief, If you want to cause dam age to the status
quo by allowing AI to harm  billionaires, I think you will be short sighted. The wealthy elite will not be happy about this.
