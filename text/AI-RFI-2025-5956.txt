General Comment
I believe that AI is not the future of the United States. We as a people need to think for ourselves and out elected officials need to do the
sam e. Furtherm ore AI is a threat to the livelihood of writers and artists alike. Using their work to train AI m odels is outright thievery. AI is
over-hyped; it is not the be all end all to the problem s that we face. Strike this down!
