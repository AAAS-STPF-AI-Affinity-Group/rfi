This enterprise will pillage enormous amounts of personally identifiable information- with Americans having few  
legal safeguards with most safeguards ignored.
Persons must have more rights over their data before AI expands queries exponentially.
It seems like Germany may have some privacy laws applicable to this situation.

Human in the loop-
No human in the loop can succeed without a detailed AI decision ‘bibliography’.
The Ai program should provide a description of all decisions and inferences and reference materials used - for  
human review.
Additionally, the AI should retain ~ references to ask ‘follow on’ questions from the human ‘approved’.
Thx
