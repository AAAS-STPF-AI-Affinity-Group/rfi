General Comment
AI should not be allowed to have unilateral access to other people's m aterials, art, and personal data nor should it have a role in
determ ining any public policy. A technology that cannot get basic facts right should not be given com plete access to everything in the US
governm ent nor should the com panies that design it be allowed to avoid all legal restrictions. No com pany should have that m uch power,
especially with a technological area that is notoriously incapable of understanding that a word can have m ultiple m eanings.
