There should be a strong focus on reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency as a 
highest priority policy action that should be in the new AI Action Plan. Data centers should mitigate 
the carbon emissions associated with AI's energy consumption by transitioning to renewable 
energy sources such as solar or wind and adopting energy -efficient practices. AI must have net zero 
emissions to keep pace with international climate goals.
