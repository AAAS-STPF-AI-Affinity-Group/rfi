General Comment
AI technologies like those created by Sam  Altm an and Open AI prey on the Am erican people and their livelihoods by stealing
intellectually owned property and profiting off of it.
The data centers that have been created by com panies like Open AI and others have ruined the living conditions in the sm all towns they
are placed in, driving up the usage of power in the given area, and polluting the area with fossil fuels used in generators just the keep the
data centers running at capacity.
There has been a net LOSS from  these com panies as they have proven they are not profitable in the slightest.
Giving them  the ability to steal from  the public to train their m odels, which have not im proved at the rate they prom ised, will not m ake
them  profitable and sustainable overnight. It's a grift against the Am erican public and will NOT stand for it.
