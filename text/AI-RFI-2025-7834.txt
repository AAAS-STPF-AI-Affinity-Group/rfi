General Comment
This is not fair use, it is theft of intellectual property from  hard working m em bers of the public. Corporations should not have the right to
avoid consequences of utilizing the works of others without express consent of the holder of the intellectual property. The precedent set by
this executive order erodes the right of people in our country to be able to hold and protect the rights of their works. It allows
corporations to do as they please with no regard or respect for the rule of law Am ericans follow and respect.
