General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in building an im pressive, powerful United States of Am erica. AI not only steals content from  foreign
influences, it taints and poisons what Am ericans believe about them selves.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as a working Am erican adult, gives m e no profit, and relies entirely on the labor of m achines that are built in
other countries.
AI is overpriced, overhyped com puter nonsense. What a waste of electricity and m oney.
