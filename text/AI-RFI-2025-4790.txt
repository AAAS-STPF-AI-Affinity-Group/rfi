General Comment
Current m odels of AI are built off of petabytes of stolen artistic, academ ic, and com m ercial work, without attribution, perm ission, or
com pensation, for the entire avowed purpose of wholly replacing that work with these LLM m odels. Allowing AI com panies to use
copyrighted works, for free, at will, to provide the sam e services that the original creators of said works provided will have a devastating
im pact on the creative and academ ic industries, destroying entire sectors of the econom y at a fragile tim e. You m ust not allow these
com panies the right to use these resources without com pensation. These com panies will say their corporate objectives cannot be achieved
if they are required to com pensate contributors (willing or not) fairly- to this I say: it is not the responsibility of citizens to subsidize the
creation of the tools that will put them  out of a job. If these com panies cannot operate without society-scale theft, then they should not be
allowed to operate.
