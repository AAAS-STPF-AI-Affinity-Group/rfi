General Comment
All form s of AI should be lim ited to training and operating on data that is one of: public dom ain inform ation; purpose-built inform ation
whose copyrights or licensing are clearly assigned to AI training/operation by a freely consenting creator in exchange for appropriate
com pensation; inform ation which is not purpose-built but whose copyrights or licensing are assigned or extended to AI training/operation
in exchange for substantive per-use com pensation. Anything less respectful to creators and their corporations (e.g., Disney) is
unacceptable.
