This action plan is a gross overreach and an extreme violation of American rights and laws. It 
will undermine decades of hard work of thousands of Americans. It is theft to an extreme and 
frankly disgusting degree, and will seriously harm the work, income and business of individuals, small businesses, and corporate entities all. What this action plan proposes is illegal, and will do nothing but cause severe harm to working Americans, and to the economy.
