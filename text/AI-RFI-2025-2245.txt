General Comment
Generative AI m ust only be allowed to train on content that they have been given explicit license to use or is public dom ain, not m erely
what is accessible to the public. That I can watch an NFL gam e in a sports bar doesn't m ean I have license to use that broadcast for
profit. Even if I pay to watch a m ovie in a theatre, that doesn't m ean I can record the m ovie and profit from  that recording. For the good
of the arts, we cannot allow Generative AI to continue to steal from  artists and businesses. It disincentivizes creating new content, which
m ay eventually lead to the death of art in our society. Consider all of the things you do outside of work. Do you watch m ovies? If
Generative AI is allowed to continue to steal content, it will no longer be profitable to m ake new m ovies. Do you listen to m usic? If
generative AI is allowed to continue to steal content, it will no longer be profitable to m ake new m usic. It has to stop.
