General Comment
Please do not allow the destruction of copyright in any circum stance, especially for generative artificial intelligence. This will allow for theft
on such a large scale in regards to creatives, research, science, patents, etc. This will allow individuals to have their work replicated
without their consent and allow for theft of creative design and com pletely ruin the livelihoods of so m any and it is beyond disrespectful to
allow this to occur. 
I'm  an artist, copyright offers protection and proper acknowledgem ent of the person behind the craft and allows them  to be adequality
recognized. Artificial intelligence is seeking to replicate the value of art and hard work yet it cannot ever because it is because it is m ade by
people which is what gives it value. 
Thank you for listening, please do not allow this to happen.
