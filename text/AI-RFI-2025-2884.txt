General Comment
It is m orally abhorrent that a m achine can scrape from  hundreds of thousands of hours of an artists' work and theoretically m ake m illions
from  that use while the artist gets nothing for it. This property is copyrighted and should not be used by com panies without fair
com pensation. That the program  cannot work without scraping from  copyrighted works m eans that the program  should not be used.
People should be fairly paid for their work, if it's that im portant (opt-in, not opt-out, and that option respected). But it isn't that im portant,
because all the program s are doing is spitting out other people's work in different ways, but not in novel or surprising ways. Any sense of
novelty or surprise com es from  the hum an elem ent, not the m achine. It's a false sense of intelligence. Instead, you've basically created a
plagiarism  m achine and m arveled at how hum an it seem s, because it spews out what hum ans already m ade.
Over and over, they try to m ake this work and it continually proves that it's not as good as hum an ingenuity and that it's overwhelm ingly
inaccurate. It's a bad product and certainly not worth scrapping copyright law for.
