Dear Government,
The world now has the first ever opportunity to save both sight and precious health $$$$ by
preventing the most common causes of preventable and irreversible silent sight loss.  
This is because of AI and advances in simple retina photography.  
Every citizen enrolling in primary care, any hospital system and any Medicare/ healthinsurance system should have a retina photo baseline for future change alert , using ai (egiKey) aswell as automatic diabetic retinopathy screening ( eg IDx, AEYE, EyRis) .
 
As a consultant eye surgeon and the founder of iKey, I would be delighted to have anopportunity to present you with more information at this critical time in USA AI planning,
Yours faithfully,
 
Kate
