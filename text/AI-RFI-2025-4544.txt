General Comment
I don't believe AI holds a place in the future of the US, where it takes and takes resources. It won't be of any gain in the long run, and is a
waste of tim e, power, and any resources going to its use. It's a stealing m achine that creates nothing original, only puts together a sloppy
version from  real artists. It's a waste essentially.
