General Comment
Regulations need to be in place to safeguard against abuse of power. AI is an exceedingly powerful tool and the capability for harm  is far
too great; the tracking and identifying of the products of AI is param ount lest the line between fact and m isinform ation blur any further. The
training of AI is especially detrim ental to creatives and those who have spent years or longer perfecting their craft deserve to have
protections in place.
