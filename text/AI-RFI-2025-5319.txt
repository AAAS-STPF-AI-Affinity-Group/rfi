General Comment
Allowing any one group to access any data or creative work they want with no regard for copyright laws, then allowing this m aterial to be
used in training program s whose sole purpose is attem pting to m im ic that data, sets a dangerous precedent that would see the creatives of
this would driven to poverty for the sake of free labor. Furtherm ore, I feel the tim ing of this com m ent window is inadequate for the
severity of these im plications, being far too short of a window at an irregular tim e and date to have the full reach it deserves.
