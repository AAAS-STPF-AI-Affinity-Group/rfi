General Comment
While I believe there is value to be had in AI technologies, the argum ent by leading generative AI developers that they m ust be exem pt
from  existing copyright laws is absurd. If your product relies on the work of others, and you can’t afford to com pensate for that work,
then you don’t have a viable business plan. There are real advancem ents being m ade that don’t rely on violating copyright that are getting
crowded out by people with an attractive sounding pitch but nothing to back it up. Providing exceptions will only serve to prop up the
com panies who don’t have anything to provide but the repackaged work of others while further sidelining the work that can truly put us in
a leading position in developing technologies.
