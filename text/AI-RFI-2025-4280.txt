General Comment
I am  strongly opposed to the developm ent of this AI action plan. I do not believe AI in it's current state has any benefit to the future of
Am erica and I don't believe sidestepping over the copyrights of sm all businesses/creators is going to change that.
AI is full of erroneous data and cannot tell the difference between a true fact and a joke. Googles search AI has fam ously recom m ended
m aking pizza with glue, eating rocks as a good source of nutrition, and m ixing chlorine bleach with white vinegar in laundry which creates
toxic gases. AI doesn't know any facts, just what facts look like, so what benefit does AI provide for national security if it doesn't know
what it's looking at?!
