General Comment
I've attached a list of AI's potential im pact and list of Policy Consideration that I would like you to consider when developing your ai
action plan.
1. AI has the potential of Disrupting or Replacing Up to 60% of U.S. Jobs
AI has the potential to autom ate tasks across industries, leading to widespread displacem ent in sectors like transportation, custom er
service, m anufacturing, and even white-collar professions like legal research, software developm ent, and accounting. While autom ation
can increase productivity and profits, it risks concentrating wealth am ong AI stakeholders while displacing m illions of workers.
Policy Considerations:
Establish a national AI Econom ic Im pact Task Force to analyze autom ation risks in real tim e.
Require com panies im plem enting AI-driven autom ation to report expected job losses and fund worker retraining program s.
Develop AI taxation m odels where com panies benefiting from  autom ation contribute to workforce transition program s.
2. AI is currently being developed and controlled by a sm all group of large tech com panies. If left unchecked, the wealth generated by AI
could flow prim arily to these corporations, widening econom ic inequality. Ensuring AI serves the broader public interest requires policy
intervention.
Policy Considerations:
AI Dividend or Autom ation Tax: Large-scale AI adopters should contribute to a public fund used for education, healthcare, and job
training.
Public AI Models: Prom ote open-source AI initiatives and governm ent-led AI research to ensure broader access and prevent
m onopolization.
Worker Equity in AI Com panies: Encourage com panies to offer profit-sharing m odels where workers displaced by AI receive a share of
AI-driven gains.
Com m unity AI Grants: Allocate funding for local AI-driven projects that benefit underserved com m unities, such as AI-powered
healthcare diagnostics in rural areas.
3. As AI system s increase productivity without direct hum an labor, the traditional link between work and financial well-being is
weakening. Without proactive m easures, this could result in m ass unem ploym ent, stagnant wages, and a decline in overall quality of life.
Policy Considerations:
Universal Basic Incom e (UBI) or AI-Generated Revenue Redistribution: If AI can generate m assive productivity gains, a portion of its
profits should fund direct financial support for displaced workers.
Shorter Work Weeks: Consider reducing work hours while m aintaining wages, allowing AI to supplem ent hum an labor instead of
replacing it.
Public Sector AI Projects: Use AI to im prove governm ent services, from  education to infrastructure, creating new public-sector jobs.
Healthcare and Mental Health Support: AI-driven job loss could increase stress and econom ic instability, requiring expanded support for
affected workers.


4. While AI will elim inate som e jobs, it will also create new ones. The challenge is ensuring workers are retrained quickly enough to
transition into these new roles.
Policy Considerations:
National AI Workforce Training Initiative: A governm ent-led program  that provides free or subsidized retraining for workers in AI-
im pacted industries.
Em ployer Incentives for Retraining: Provide tax credits or subsidies to com panies that reskill workers instead of replacing them  with AI.
AI-Powered Career Guidance Tools: Use AI to m atch workers with retraining opportunities based on their skills and job m arket trends.
Apprenticeship Program s in AI Fields: Partner with tech com panies to create hands-on AI and autom ation training program s.
5. AI m odels are often trained on copyrighted m aterials without direct com pensation to the original creators. Writers, artists, m usicians,
and other content creators are losing revenue as AI generates content based on their work.
Policy Considerations:
AI Training Royalties: Require AI com panies to pay copyright holders when their work is used for AI training.
AI Transparency Laws: Require AI com panies to disclose what data is used in training and provide an audit trail for copyrighted content.
Creator Revenue-Sharing Models: Platform s that host AI-generated content should allocate a percentage of earnings to the original
content creators.
