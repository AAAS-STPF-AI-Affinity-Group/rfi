General Comment
AI is a m arket sim ilar to that of cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and will cause huge legal problem s by
enabling them  to begin with.
The utilization of it for governm ental purposes seem s like m any present and future problem s that m ajor third party com panies m ight not be
favorable toward, especially with piracy as it allows these perm issions that will cause m ore situations then there really needs to be.
AI really has no future in the US, is unpopular by the vast m ajority of the public and is reaching its end.
