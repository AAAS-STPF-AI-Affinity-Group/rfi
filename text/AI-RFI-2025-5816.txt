General Comment
Tech giants such as OpenAI or Google should not have special perm ission to steal copyrighted works from  hardworking artists, writers
and creators for the purpose of training their AI m odels. 
Millions of Am ericans' jobs will be replaced by (or have already been replaced by) AI tools. Allowing big tech com panies such as
OpenAI or Google to advance their AI agenda will further destroy the livelihoods of hard working Am ericans for profit. 
Am ericans will suffer in the so called "com petition" for "AI suprem acy." A m atter of which does not keep Am ericans safe. The Am erican
governm ent should focus its efforts onto im proving its econom y & supporting its citizens to allow them  to create and witness beautiful
works of hum an achievem ent, art, passion and creativity.
