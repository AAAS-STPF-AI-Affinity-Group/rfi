General Comment
This is a reversal of the very heart of copyright law. Absolutely not. No private com pany deserves to skirt copyright just because they
have a trendy technology that can't m ake a profit. I refuse to let this blunder into our culture.
This will set back Am erican ingenuity by decades and cost us billions if not m ore. Coders, artists, writers, journalists, anyone who could
ever be concerned about copyright, about proprietary inform ation, about Am erican culture and econom y, should halt this im m ediately.
