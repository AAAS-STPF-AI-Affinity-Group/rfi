General Comment
The federal governm ent m ust respect existing copyright protections and strengthen the enforcem ent of the existing copyright system  in
order to protect content creators who are the lifeblood of the Am erican econom y. Without that, we face a landscape where the only
people who create and share content online will be the AI com panies. Individuals will increasingly abandoned online spaces where their
content can be captured to train AIs if their rights are not protected.
