General Comment
Generative Ai currently functions by take the work of thousands without their consent or com pensation and allowing Google and openai to
train off of the work of thousands both violates copyright law but is also currently part of a open lawsuit. them  asking to train off of others
work this way is just their attem pts to dodge that law suit because they know they're going to lose it and have to pay for the work they
stole. Our governm ent should not be com plicit in theft and com panies trying to dodge law suits.
