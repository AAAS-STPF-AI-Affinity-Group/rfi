Re: AI Action Plan, Submission to the O
ffice of Science and Technology Policy 
I am the Jonas Robitscher Professor of Law in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data 
Science, Emory University.1 I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to OSTP’s call for policy ideas 
aimed at enhancing America’s global leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI).2  
My primary points in this submission are that if, contrary to precedent and sound policy, American 
courts rule that training AI models on copyrighted works is not permissible as fair use, the U.S. 
government must be ready to act. And furthermore, to maintain U.S. leadership in artificial 
intelligence, the AI Action Plan should explicitly affirm the importance of broad copyright exceptions—particularly fair use for nonexpressive activities like AI model training.  
How copyright law in various countries deals with AI training   
In “The Globalization of Copyright Exceptions for AI Training”  my co-author  Professor Peter Yu and I 
examine how copyright frameworks across the world have addressed the apparent tension between  
copyright law and copy-reliant technologies such as computational data analysis in the form of text 
data mining (TDM), machine learning and AI.

Our research reveals that , although the world has yet to achieve a true consensus on copyright and AI 
training, an international equilibrium has emerged. In this equilibrium, countries recognize that TDM , 
machine learning and AI training can be socially valuable and do not inherently prejudice the copyright 
holders’ legitimate interests. Policymakers in the European Union, Japan, Israel, and Singapore agree 
1 I offer these comments my personal capacity only.  
2 For context , the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)  requested input on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  to define the priority policy actions needed to sustain and enhance America's AI 
dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation.  See 
Exec. Order No. 14,179, 90 Fed. Reg. 8741 (Jan. 31, 2025) (Executive Order titled “Removing Barriers to American 
Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,” signed by President Trump ).

in general terms that such uses should therefore be allowed without express authorization in some, 
but not necessarily all, circumstances.  
Major industrialized economies have found different ways to this equilibrium position. Some, like the 
U.S. and Israel have done so through the fair use doctrine. Others, like Japan, Singapore, and the 
European Union, have crafted express copyright exceptions for TDM and computational data 
analysis. Other nations where the rule of law is not so clearly established are energetically pursuing AI 
development with state backing without updated copyright laws to facilitate AI training. There is little 
doubt that if the Chinese Communist Party deems copyright law an impediment to its AI ambitions, 
the law in China will change almost instantaneously, and very likely retrospectively.  
U.S. litigation could unsettle global AI copyright norms 
American courts have historically recognized fair use protections for technologies relying on 
nonexpressive copying, such as reverse engineering,4 plagiarism detection software,5 digital library 
searches,6 and computational humanities research spanning millions of scanned texts.7 Extending this 
principle logically, training AI models—which similarly involves copying without directly reproducing 
expressive content—would usually qualify as fair use.8 Yet, plaintiffs in more than 30 ongoing lawsuits 
across U.S. district courts contest this view.9 Collectively, they seek injunctions barring AI training 
without explicit consent, billions in monetary compensation, and even destruction of existing AI 
models.10 Although, in my estimation and that of many copyright experts,11 the plaintiffs are unlikely 
to prevail on sweeping arguments that would bring AI training in the U.S. to a halt , they might.12

A bad court decision may drive AI innovation offshore 
Adverse outcomes in U.S. litigation will not stop the development of AI, they will simply push AI 
innovation overseas. The reason is straightforward: AI models, once trained, are easily portable. 
Companies seeking to avoid restrictive copyright rules could simply move their training operations to innovation-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore, Israel, or Japan, and then serve U.S. customers 
remotely, entirely free of domestic copyright concerns.  
How is this possible? AI developers need fair use for all the copying that takes place to make training 
possible, but they don’t need fair use once the models have been trained because, by-and-large, trained 
AI models do not replicate the expressive details of their training datasets; instead, they distill general 
patterns, abstractions, and insights from that training data.
13 Thus, in the eyes of copyright law, these 
models are neither copies nor derivative works based on the training data. If U.S. copyright law turns 
against our AI industry, companies in the U.S. will still be able to use models trained in AI-friendly 
jurisdictions by either setting up a data pipeline so that the model stays overseas or  hosting their 
models in the United States once it has been trained. Consequently, imposing overly restrictive 
copyright interpretations domestically will do very little to turn back the tide on AI, but risks 
surrendering America’s AI advantage to more AI-friendly jurisdictions.  
Licensing deals are no substitute for fair use While licensing agreements between AI developers and media companies are becoming more 
common, they cannot solve copyright concerns surrounding AI training. The sheer scale of AI training 
data makes the licensing approach impractical at the cutting edge. For instance, Meta’s recent Llama 3 model consumed over 15 trillion ( 15,000,000,000,000) tokens drawn from publicly accessible 
sources. To put this into perspective, assuming that t he New York Times print edition is roughly fifty 
pages per day, each page has 4000 words, and there are 1.3 tokens per word, the newspaper would 
generate roughly 1.82 million tokens per week . At that rate , it would take about 158,500 years for the 
New York Times to generate 15 trillion tokens. Licensing at the scale required to train frontier LLMs 
is not a realistic foundation for American industrial policy, it is a fantasy. 
Nevertheless, existing deals with major media companies illustrate something important: AI developers are willing to pay for efficient access to high-quality datasets otherwise locked behind paywalls or machine-readable restrictions. Such agreements suggest that licensing has a niche but crucial role—not as a substitute for broad exceptions like fair use, but rather as a complementary 
source of premium training data. This dynamic becomes particularly valuable in AI-powered search 
scenarios, where language models frequently generate outputs closely resembling original copyrighted content, pushing the boundaries between acceptable use and potential infringement.

about it, see Matthew Sag, Copyright Safety for Generative AI , 61 H OUS. L. REV. 295 (2023) and the literature discussed 
therei n. Note that many AI companies have now adopted significant  copyright safety practices.

The U.S. Government must be ready to act 
If, contrary to precedent and sound policy in my view, American courts rule that training AI models 
on copyrighted works is not permissible as fair use, the U.S. government should act. Specifically , the 
government would need to introduce legislation to reinstate the principle that training AI models 
typically falls under fair use or create a specific statutory exemption. I see no way this could be done 
through agency rulemaking or executive action. Legislative intervention would be necessary to 
safeguard America’s competitive edge against innovation-friendly jurisdictions like Japan, Singapore, Israel, and, in this context, even the European Union. 
To maintain U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, the AI Action Plan should explicitly affirm the 
importance of broad copyright exceptions—particularly fair use for nonexpressive activities like AI 
model training.
