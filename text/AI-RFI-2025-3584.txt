General Comment
Generative AI is not possible without widespread theft of copyrighted m aterial, both writing and art. As an artist and a writer m yself, I am
horrified that m y governm ent would choose to privilege a corporation over its own citizens’ lawful copyrights.
Furtherm ore, it produces bad content. AI art is ugly, lacking any hum an warm th, wisdom , interest, or intellectual perspective. AI writing
and research is incorrect all the tim e. Like, constantly. I’ve seen it, as tech com panies keep trying to force AI tools on end users. We
don’t want it.
Finally, widespread adoption of AI will elim inate work for hum ans and upend the econom y. This is good for no one except the tiny
handful of business owners who stand to profit by m ass layoffs. 
AI is not worth investing in. I oppose this m easure with m y entire being.
