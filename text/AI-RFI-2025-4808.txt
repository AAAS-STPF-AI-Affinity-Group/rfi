General Comment
I don't believe that I, a Canadian (not Am erican) citizen, should have to work 20+ hours of m y life to create an artwork for a private
project within m y own country, only to have it taken to train AI in the United States of Am erica with zero com pensation or credit for m y
tim e, ability, education, or experience. If you cannot build a m odel that runs on consentually aquired data, your m odel shouldn't exist at all.
Why does Mr. Altm an get paid for m y independent work? Why can Open AI train its m odel on m y independent work for profit? Why do
you insist on ignoring international copyright laws, as though your country is the only one to exist?
