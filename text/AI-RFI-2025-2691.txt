General Comment
To allow these com panies to have access to all this content and m edia, without any barriers or any walls, is evil. It goes against the laws of
our nation, and even the very foundational papers behind it. By doing this, you lose the trust of every single Am erican, every single artist,
creator, studio. You even go against the com panies that m ake up our nation, giving away all their copyrighted m aterial to a com puter. Do
not do this. Do not.
