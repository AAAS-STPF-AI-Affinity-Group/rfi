General Comment
AI program s profit off of theft and unconsented usage of online artist's work with no com pensation in any form . The guardrail is to be
rem oved is basic hum an decency and respect towards the people who have put their tim e into creating works of art and sharing it online,
only for AI's to be trained to replace them  without them  even knowing.
If Am erica is about the individual's ability to forge their own path and becom e their own m an, AI m erely lives off the backs of those
who've sought and will seek their own success in this nation. It only teaches people to do becom e com placent in their lack of skill, relying
entirely on a m achine to create that which is subpar, and Am erica is not at all about creating a subpar product.
OpenAI and other relevant com panies should not be allowed to develop their AI by continuing to steal other's work, and even the current
m ethod of obtaining training data is im m oral and goes against the ability for every Am erican to thrive using their own skills and capabilities.
I do not believe that this change is ethical in any regard, nor is AI for having gone this far already.
