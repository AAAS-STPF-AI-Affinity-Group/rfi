General Comment
I suspect you guys take m ost of these com m ents with a grain of salt. I am  writing with a bit of a cynical attitude. It is safe to say, however,
if you censure what I say, I wont ask anybody to sing a tune in m y defense.

In developing inform ation for an Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence. An artificial intelligence action plan needs som e straightforward
pieces to work right: a plain goal saying what the AI’s supposed to do, a solid plan for getting good data it can use, a setup explaining the
tech and tools it’ll run on, som e basic rules to keep it fair and honest, a schedule with checkpoints to see how it’s going, and a look at
what could go wrong—like if it starts acting funny or unfair. You’ve also got to say who’s building it, who’s watching it, and who’s using
it, plus a way to tweak it when folks say how it’s doing. That keeps it hum m ing along, doing what it’s m eant to, without any big m esses.
Write a Digital Constution to keep the hum ans from  screwing everything up. Write it for today and succinct enough to last 400 years +
