General Comment
USA will use their power leverage to scrape the whole internet and destroy creative industries of other less developing countries along
with their own, which was already stifled by Woke m ovem ent. Apparently US governm ent doesn't give a single thought to their citizens for
letting a health insurance m onopoly to m ass m urder their own citizens in their own countries. Now they will let greedy tech bros steal
people's data with no constraint and obliterate their own people's livelihoods first then people from  other countries later. US people can't
even survive with a 9-5 job anym ore. If these giant techs are handled free reign, they will drag the whole world to som e place worse than
Hells
