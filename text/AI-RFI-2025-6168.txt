General Comment
These LLM require huge swatches of data from  online to exist. Why is their data laundering allowed to pull from  m y work without credit,
perm ission, acknowledgem ent, and without com pensation? Just because these data sets encom pass so m uch of hum an work that the
individual pieces get lost from  view, does not m ean our work is without value. There needs to be regulations, laws, restrictions, and
reviews. Our current legal system s are extrem ely behind on these issues that ai is generating. I fear what happens if hum an work is so
undervalued and dim inished due to the sheer scale of the theft involving everything ever m ade by all of hum an existence.
