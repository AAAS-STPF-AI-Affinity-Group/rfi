General Comment
I oppose this rule because generative AI steals from  the livelihood of hardworking Am erican artists, writer and creatives and is contrary to
the Am erican spirit. AI is a scam , m odern-day snake oil. It is an incredibly expensive plagiarism  m achine that will create nothing of value,
and it will be a colossal waste of resources, m oney and tax dollars to invest anything into it.
