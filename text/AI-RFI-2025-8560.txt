General Comment
As an artist who has had their works used to "train" AI without m y consent to m ake derivative works based on m y work that directly
com petes with m y own work in the com m ercial space, I condem n the notion that any AI com pany should be given license to steal that
which is not theirs to put m e out of business. This is RIDICULOUS!
