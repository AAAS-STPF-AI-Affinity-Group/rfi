General Comment
Generative AI has no place in the future on the United States. It steals from  creators, ruining the livelihoods of countless people who will
never receive credit for their work that's regurgitated in poorer form  through AI. This endeavor destroys the environm ent, while its users
are ignorant of the consequences. AI feeds the public lies and harm fully false inform ation, som etim es under the guise of facts from
seem ingly reputable sources. Generative AI is a disgrace that violates copyrights, actively harm s creators, irreparably dam ages the
environm ent and natural resources, and m isleads the public with disastrous consequences. This trajectory MUST be stopped im m ediately
not only for the preservation of the value of the arts, but also for the sake of the future for all Am ericans.
