General Comment
I'm  a writer. I've been writing and telling stories since I was 3 years old. My writing is extrem ely personal and often deals with m y
disability. I published articles and fiction long before GenAI existed. Now, OpenAI wants to steal from  artists with im punity, setting a
dangerous precedent. AI plagiarizes by design while understanding nothing. It encodes bias, which som e people pretend is "objective."
Stop AI from  m ining and profiting from  artist's work. Artists should retain all copyright, credit, and power over their work and m ake a
living from  it.
