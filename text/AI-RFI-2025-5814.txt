General Comment
AI as we know it today is infringing on the hard won copyrights of Am ericans as well as their freedom  and privacy by indiscrim inately
scraping the internet of m aterials. The technology is also deeply flawed. It is proven tim e and tim e again that generative AI produces
incorrect, flawed, and even dangerous answers when posed quesions. Com panies using AI often find them selves doing m ore work to
com pensate for it's short com ings. As a private citizen, the growth of AI and m y inability to opt out of it has been alarm ing. I feel m y
privacy, a freedom  I am  allowed, has been breached, particularly with how easy it is to use som eones likeness in AI and create
defam atory im ages of m yself and others. The expenses of running AI facilities to will cost the Am erican tax payer, all whole robbing them
of resources such as the sam e electricity running the stations (experts suggest the dem and for AI, if not curbed, will cause black outs due
to power consum ption). I also worry about investing in a technology which is m aking Am ericans less self sufficient. These com panies are
often asking us to let AI m ake our choices and I cannot think of anything less Am erican then allowing yourself to be controlled by the
whim s of a m achine.
My suggestion is at this tim e to no longer put such a focus on developing AI, and put those resources elsewhere.
