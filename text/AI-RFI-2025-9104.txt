General Comment
These AI com panies have no interest in the benefit of the country or its citizens, especially those who have dedicated their lives to creative
pursuits that provide a wide array of benefits to our society as a whole. This AI technology is speculative and prim arily fueled by hype and
the desire to som ehow create profit, all without any concern for the backs they m ay be stepping on. Such com panies should be held to
high standards and m ore strict regulation instead of being given free rein to consum e every piece of m edia in existence to fuel its failing
experim ent. Do not bow to their wishes while they throw everyday citizens, artists, and sm all businesses under the bus. Do not reward
them  for encouraging people to discard individual thought and hard work, rejecting the pursuit to develop your own skills to create, and
instead urging people to rely on a m achine to do the thinking and production for them . It is a stain on art, education, production, and free
thought.
