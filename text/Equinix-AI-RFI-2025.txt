Re: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action 
Plan 
To Whom It May Concern:  
Equinix appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Request for Information 
(RFI) on the AI Action Plan issued by the Networking and Information Technology 
Research and Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office (NCO), National 
Science Fou ndation on behalf of the White House Office of Science and Technology 
Policy (OSTP) on February 6, 2025.  
Equinix Introduction  
Equinix is the world’s digital infrastructure company and one of the largest data center 
operators globally, with a fleet of nearly 270 data centers in 73 metros across 34 
countries, with more under development.  We serve more than 10,000 enterprise, 
government, network and cloud customers, including 90% of the Fortune 100 and 
nearly 50% of the Global 2000. We opened our first data center in Ashburn, VA in 1998, 
and our first data centers were critical to helping the early internet scale.  Equinix has 
since played pivotal roles in the digital transformation of enterprises and governments, 
provided the digital infrastructure that underpins the most critical financial ecosystems 
globally  (including NASDA Q), and we are now positioned to provide the essential digital 
infrastructure that will underpin the AI revolution.   
Equinix operates two types of data centers , colocation and “xScale”:  
•A colocation data center (“colo”) is a facility where businesses and other
organizations can rent space for servers and other computing hardware. Instead
of maintaining their own data center, enterprises can house their IT infrastructure
in a shared, secure facility that provides physical space (usually in racks or
cages), power supply and backup power, cooling systems, network connectivity,
physical security and technical support. Colocation data centers also facilitate
interconnection (direct one -to-one con nection via fiber optic cables), which
provides for high speed, private data transfer from one company or enterprise to
another as well as peering among network service providers.  Interconnections
also facilitate hybrid multi -cloud deployments and are uti lized by our enterprise
customers to connect to the more than 3,000 cloud and IT service providers
within our facilities. Equinix boasts more than 482,000 discrete interconnections


Equinix Response: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
Page 2 of 9 across our platform. Densely interconnected colocation data centers, such as the 
typical Equinix data center, create robust IT ecosystems, which facilitate further 
innovation for workloads that require lower latency and faster, more voluminous 
data transfer. This is of critical importance to AI inference. Colocation facilities 
represent the large majority of Equinix’s current fleet.  
•xScale is Equinix’s hyperscale solution.  Equinix may have hundreds of customers
in a single colocation facility with thousands of interconnections between them,
while an xScale facility may only have one or a handful of customers leasing tens
or even hundreds of megawatts of capacity. Cloud service providers represent
the typical xScale customer.  While colocation facilities are ideal for AI inference,
an xScale facility can be particularly well suited  for AI model training.
We believe our unique perspective as the industry leader in colocation, interconnection, 
and cloud on ramps can provide valuable insight into the challenges and opportunities 
faced by data center operators as they work to meet AI driven demand in the U.S.  
The Opportunity 
As the United States stands at the forefront of an AI -driven economic and technological 
revolution, the Trump Administration has a unique opportunity to cement American 
dominance in this groundbreaking field. Global leadership, national security, and 
econo mic prosperity belongs to those who control AI infrastructure, and Equinix has 
built the backbone that makes it all possible. Our global network of interconnected data 
centers is the world’s most secure, scalable, and efficient platform for AI compute, 
where the global technology leaders deploy their artificial intelligence.  
We don’t just host servers; we orchestrate the flow of AI at scale.  With industry -leading, 
low-latency, high -performance data processing closer to end users and devices , and 
partnerships spanning Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Dell and beyond, Equinix is 
the neutral ground where AI’s raw power meets real -world impact. Our globally 
interconnected footprint of data centers is not a commodity —it is a strategic asset, 
purpose -built to handle the exascale demands of AI workloads, from training to 
inference, across every industry and includes defense, intelligence community, and 
civilian government customers.   
The following outlines why we believe Equinix is critically important to America’s AI 
ambitions and offers strategic recommendations for the Trump Administration’s 
forthcoming AI policy. We urge a focus on three interlocking priorities —power, supply 
chain,  and technology talent —that will ensure the U.S. retains its dominant position in AI 
infrastructure. By partnering with industry leaders like Equinix, the Trump Administration 
can unlock the full potential of its AI strategy while advancing an “America Fir st” agenda.  


Equinix Response: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
Page 3 of 9 Why Equinix is Critically Important  
Equinix is not just a data center provider; we are the backbone of the digital economy. 
Our differentiation is enabling interconnected data to unlock opportunity, and our value 
lies in three key areas that directly support AI development and deployment:  
1.Unmatched Infrastructure for AI Workloads
AI requires massive computational power, vast data storage, and low -latency
connectivity —capabilities that Equinix delivers securely and at scale. Our globally
interconnected footprint of International Business Exchange (IBX) data centers
hosts the ecosyst ems where the industry’s leading brands, cloud providers, and
AI leaders like Microsoft, Google, AWS and NVIDIA converge. With over 10,000
customers and 2,000+ network connections, Equinix facilitates the high -spee d,
secure data exchange essential for training and deploying AI models. In the U.S.
alone, our facilities support the critical infrastructure that powers everything from
generative AI to financial markets to critical national security applications. The
race for AI dominance isn’t actually about who builds the best model —it’s about
who deploys it fastest, most reliably, and at the edge of every market near end -
users. That’s Equinix. We don’t compete with the hyperscalers; we enable
them —and our ten th ousand plus customers —to win.
2.A Strategic Asset for National Security
Securing U.S. dominance in AI is a national and economic security imperative,
and Equinix’s infrastructure is a linchpin in this effort. Our data centers are
trusted by government agencies, including those responsible for national
security, and defense con tractors to host the most sensitive workloads, ensuring
data sovereignty and resilience against cyber threats. Our global footprint, paired
with a commitment to U.S. -based operations, positions us to support the
Admi nistration’s goals of securing AI supply chains and maintaining technological
dominance over adversaries like China.
3.A Catalyst for Economic Growth
Equinix drives job creation, innovation, and investment across the country. Our
U.S. operations employ thousands directly and support tens of thousands of jobs
indirectly through our customers and partners.  By providing the physical and
digital foundation for AI, we enable businesses to scale, compete, and lead —
amplifying the economic benefits of AI for American workers and the communities
we operate in.
Our expertise, unique profile, and scale can make us an indispensable partner for the 
Trump Administration as it crafts an AI strategy to lead the world. We stand ready to be 
a resource.

Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
Page 4 of 9 Policy Recommendations  
To maximize America’s AI potential, Equinix recommends that the Trump Administration 
prioritize three critical areas: power, supply chain, and workforce. These align with the 
needs of the broader data center industry and the Trump Administration’s “America  
First” vision.  
1.Power: Ensuring Abundant, Reliable Energy for AI Growth
The Challenge:  Access to abundant, reliable, 24/7 baseload power is a primary
consideration for data center operators, including Equinix, as they do site
selection and work to meet the immense demands of AI. Power availability
constraints across the U.S., driven by both generation and transmission
shortfalls, are hampering data center growth today and without remediation this
will only get worse.
It is no secret that AI is highly energy intensive. A single AI training run can
consume as much electricity as thousands of households, and demand is
surging —with projected increases of as much as 165% by 2030 .  A typical, non -
AI deployment in an Equinix data center might require between 5 and 10 kVA per
rack while a cutting -edge AI deployment in the same rack can demand upwards
of 130 kVA.  This represents an increase in power requirements and power
density of 13 -26 times.  While GPUs are projected to become more efficient,
customers are expected to deploy more of them in the same rack which would
negate many of the forthcoming efficiency gains. This is requiring data center
operators like Equinix to rethink the w ay we design, cool, and power our facilities
These realities are why Equinix has adopted an “all of the above” power strategy
that includes advanced nuclear, gas fuel cells and turbines, and renewables. No
single energy source will be able to meet the immense demands of AI model
training or AI inference in the near term. Advanced nuclear is not ready yet,
supply chain and infrastructure constraints limit the use of gas as an onsite
power generation technology, and intermittent renewables are not a good match
for the 24/7 demand of AI. Similarly, Equinix and the broader industry require
flexibility in power deployment. This means leveraging grid power, co -located or
behind the meter arrangements, and on -site power generation. It will truly take all
sources in all configurations to meet AI demand.
Additionally, Equinix works tirelessly to improve the efficiency of our operations.  
Improving efficiency doesn’t just make business sense, it is also increasingly 
necessary due to the power availability constraints present across the U.S. 
Equinix has been  at the forefront of this relentless drive towards efficiency, 
including becoming the first colocation provider to adopt ASHRAE A1A standards 


Equinix Response: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
Page 5 of 9 that will be raising the temperatures in our data centers and thereby lowering 
electricity consumption required for cooling. Equinix has also leveraged AI to 
improve power efficiency. We have demonstrated efficiency gains of 9% by 
utilizing AI controlled cooling system software in a Frankfurt data center, for 
instance.1 We and the industry continue to invest in and explore innovative 
efficiency solutions, including liquid cooling.2  We plan to support direct to chip 
liquid cooling in more than 100 of our data centers globally.3 Equinix’s 
commitment to driving efficiency across our fleet has led to significant reductions 
in our Power Usage Effectiveness (“PUE”) measurement every year. PUE is a 
representation of how much power is used by IT equipment, such as servers, 
verses building operations including cooling.  1.0 is considered perfect. The 
Uptime Institute found that the industry average PUE in 2024 is 1.56.4  Equinix 
targets a PUE of 1.3 or better for all new build facilities and has a fleetwide 
average of better than 1.42, down from 1.54 in 2019.   
The confluence of “electrify everything”, near -shoring of advanced 
manufacturing, AI, decades of under -investment in the grid, and an antiquated 
permitting system that slows the build out of new transmission and generation 
capacity are driving power availa bility constraints across the U.S., which threaten 
to undermine American AI dominance unless remediated. The Trump 
Administration has a historic opportunity to solve for these constraints and 
unleash energy dominance.   
The Opportunity:  The Trump Administration can unleash AI innovation by 
prioritizing energy abundance. Equinix applauds the Trump Administration’s 
commitment to securing AI leadership and unleashing American energy . Solving 
for power availability constraints in the U.S. is by far the most impactful lever the 
Trump Administration can pull to ensure the U.S. maintains dominance in AI.  
Doing so will benefit all industries, including AI and advanced manufacturing.

Recommendations:  
• Streamline Permitting:  It can take up to 10 years to permit an interregional 
transmission line in the U.S. currently.  America’s  adversaries face no such 
constraints. We recommend that the Trump Administration work to accelerate 
approvals for new power generation and transmission projects through 
leveraging existing authorities to cut red tape and by working with Congress 
to pass durable permitting, planning, and siting  reforms.  
• Support Diverse Energy Sources & Configurations: To meet the step 
change in power requirements from AI demand, we must leverage all 
available sources in all configurations . We recommend the Trump 
Administration backs an “all of the above” strategy that includes advanced 
nuclear, gas, and renewables to meet AI’s baseload and peak demands, 
ensuring abundant, reliable, and cost -competitive power for data centers and 
others. Equ inix has been at the forefront of sourcing diverse forms of power. 
In addition to our advanced nuclear commitments, Equinix was the first data 
center operator to deploy natural gas powered fuel cells.  Equinix now has 
Bloom fuel cells deployed at 19 IBX data centers in 6 states5.      
It is also important that data center operators are able to leverage grid 
connected power, co -located or behind the meter arrangements, and onsite 
generation.  There is no “silver bullet” generation source or power delivery 
configuration in the near term.   
• Accelerate Advanced Nuclear:   Advanced nuclear offers great promise for 
delivering abundant, reliable, 24/7 baseload energy, though it is still years 
away from deployment. Equinix was the first data center operator to commit 
to sourcing power from advanced small modular reactors, making a 
prepayment to procure at least 500MW from Oklo.6  Since this agreement 
was reached, many other data center operators have announced similar 
commitments. The Trump Administration can endeavor to speed up the safe 
deployment of advanced nuclear, including small modular reactors.  This will 
require further modernizations to licensing and permitting, the establishment 
of a robust domestic fuel production and r ecycling ecosystem, the 
development of a large nuclear workforce, and education on the safety and 
merits of advanced nuclear in the communities they will be deployed in.  At

Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
Page 7 of 9 the same time, we must continue to invest in the existing nuclear fleet, to 
include uprates and restarts where possible.   
An all of the above,  power -first strategy will ensure Equinix and the broader data 
center industry can step up to meet AI driven demand , ensuring AI breakthroughs 
happen here and stay here while creating American jobs in energy and 
construction.  Such a strategy will benefit all industries and ratepayers.  
2.Supply Chain: Securing Resilience, Capacity, and Bolstering Domestic
Manufacturing
The Challenge:  AI relies on a complex global supply chain for hardware —power
infrastructure, chips, servers, and cooling systems —much of which is vulnerable
to disruptions and foreign control, especially from China. Further, lead times for
critical data center component s including transformers, utility scale generators,
turbines, and water -cooling equipment can be years long due to limited
production capacity domestically and abroad. For example, lead times for
transformers have increased from approximately  50 weeks in 2021 to 120 weeks
in 2024.7
The Opportunity:  The Trump Administration’s reshoring focus can strengthen
domestic supply chains, aligning with Equinix’s U.S. -centric operations and the
industry’s need for supply chain resilience and capacity.
Recommendations:
•Bolster Domestic Manufacturing:  Expand incentives for producing AI -
critical components in the U.S. and incentivize increasing production capacity
in the U.S., reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and enhancing supply
chain security. Consider leveraging existing authorities  and working with
Congress to bolster domestic production capacity of critical components.
•Fortify Partnerships:  Encourage collaboration between data center
operators like Equinix and American manufacturers to localize supply chains.
•Targeted Trade Policies:  Use trade tools strategically to protect U.S.
interests without choking innovation or access to critical materials before
there is a domestic source or sufficient supply, ensuring US companies can
access critical components and cutting -edge tech efficient ly and without
disruption.

Equinix Response: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
Page 8 of 9 A fortified supply chain will empower the data center industry to deliver 
uninterrupted AI infrastructure, reinforcing America’s technological edge.  
3.Workforce: Building an AI -Ready American Labor Force
The Challenge:  AI’s rise demands a skilled workforce —data center technicians,
engineers, and AI specialists as well as those in the building trades —yet
shortages persist, risking delays in deployment and growth. Data center
operators are already encountering workforce constraints in numerous markets,
particularly those that have large deployments of data centers.  Equinix partners
with local community and technical colleges in the communities we operate, such
as the Northern Virginia Community College, to design curriculum and offer
scholarships, mentorship opportunities and paid internships. 8 Equinix also works
to recruit veterans through partnerships with DoD’s SkillBridge Program and our
own Pathways program. Equinix has been recognized as a gold level employer
by Military Friendly for two years running.  9
Data center operators are also impacted by workforce shortages in construction
trades  that are inhibiting growth. Large scale data centers, like an Equinix xScale
or other hyperscale facility, can require thousands of trades people to build over
a period of years. This can strain existing workforces in a locality if there are
numerous large -scale  projects under development at the same time.
The Opportunity:  The Trump Administration can harness America’s
entrepreneurial spirit to upskill workers, aligning with the industry’s need for talent
and further bolstering positive economic impact for the communities we build and
operate in.
Recommendations:
•Expand Training Programs:  Fund career and technical education and
apprenticeship initiatives in partnership with industry, leveraging Equinix’s
expertise to train workers for data center and AI roles.  Similarly, support the
robust growth of the talent pipeline for the building tr ades who construct AI
data centers.
•Promote STEM Education:  Invest in K -12 and higher education to build a
strong pipeline of American talent, ensuring US companies have the
workforce to scale.
