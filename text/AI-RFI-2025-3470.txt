General Comment
As a developing artist and program m er, I am  apalled at the governm ent's com plete lack of respect and consideration towards the creative
m inds that power this nation. Allowing AI to steal from  those sharing their unique perspectives with the world does nothing but hurt our
worldview as a whole.
