General Comment
One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so com e on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want som e gin and juice
But I really don't wanna
Beer-bust like I had last week
I m ust stay deep because talk is cheap
… I like Angela, Pam ela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue, you know they getting sweeter (uh)
So what can I do? I really beg you, m y Lord
To m e is flirting is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let m e dum p it
Please set in the trum pet
… A little bit of Monica in m y life
A little bit of Erica by m y side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you m akes m e your m an (ah)
… Mam bo Num ber Five (ah)
… Jum p up and down and m ove it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hand on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hand once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this then you're doing it right
… A little bit of Monica in m y life
A little bit of Erica by m y side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you m akes m e your m an (ah)
… Trum pet, the trum pet
Mam bo Num ber Five, hahaha
… A little bit of Monica in m y life
A little bit of Erica by m y side


A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you m akes m e your m an (huh)
… I do all to fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and m e gonna touch the sky
