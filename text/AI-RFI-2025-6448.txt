General Comment
Proponents of generative "AI" technology are sim ply con m en trying to steal what they could not m ake them selves. Though I have little
hope that the governm ent of the United States cares m uch for the rights of individual artists, I think it would be wise to rem em ber that this
would affect m edia corporations as well. Do you really want to be sued by Disney because OpenAI wants to train on its intellectual
property for free?
Also, do you rem em ber NFTs? They were supposed to be the next big thing, everyone was pushing them , they had Super Bowl
com m ercials, they had apes (bored), they were going to be THE FUTURE. And then the bubble burst. The sam e thing will happen with
generative "AI". Do you really want to be the one holding the bag when it does?
As an artist, I find generative "AI" m orally and intellectually reprehensible. As a hum an being, I find it incredibly stupid and I think anyone
who thinks this particular bubble will last m uch longer is incredibly naive.
