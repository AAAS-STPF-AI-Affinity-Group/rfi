There is a consensus in my community that AI is massively overhyped and holds no place in
the creative world (or anywhere else). What we have right now is a juiced up version ofgoogle autocomplete that Iâ€™m confident will be obsolete in the near future. Meanwhilecompanies like openAI are ripping off the American people and trying to destroy ourlivelihoods with a product that produces meaningless garbage.
