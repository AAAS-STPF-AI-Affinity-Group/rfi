General Comment
Scraping copyrighted content or intellectual properties from  the internet or other places does not just affect Am ericans, but the entire
world.
They cannot assure that the place they are stealing these creative works to train their AI's would even be legal, as they would not have the
representation or laws supporting them  to do so in other countries.
Doing this is directly profiting by theft from  individuals, who are unable to defend them selves from  large corporations. Copyright and
intellectual property laws exist for a reason. Generative AI should not exist unless they pay for all the inform ation they have already stolen,
and if they're not willing to do so, all AI m odels should be perm anently deleted.
