General Comment
Absurd. Why should these private com panies get to steal whatever they want? Ingenuity of the Am erican people cannot be rewarded by
theft. It m akes no sense that a com pany can steal copyrighted works because of "AI"--these are active choices that we, the people,
should be able to m ake. It's insulting enough that AI barely adds anything to m y life already; knowing that it can take copyrighted item s for
free and use them  for its own profit, when I would not be allowed to use a 30-second clip of m usic in a video, feels outrageous. Shouldn't
AI be subject to all the rules and lim itations that a hum an creator would?
