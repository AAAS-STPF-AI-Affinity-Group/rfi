General Comment
AI is purely hype and should not be standard for US Interests. It harm s the environm ent, it harm s the econom y, and it encourages cheating
in life. AI should be extrem ely regulated, as there can be copyright issues and AI should NOT be exem pt from  these issues. AI does not
have a place in the future. Why should we care about anything or listen to anything if a real hum an being didn't put the effort into it? I want
Hum ans, not AI. I want Hum an Artists, Not AI. I want Hum an Musicians, Not AI. I want HUMAN DOCTORS, Not AI. I WANT
HUMANS.
