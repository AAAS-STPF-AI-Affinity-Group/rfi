General Comment
Please work harder and invest m ore into ai safety. I'd really like to not have m y whole fam ily and species die because our governm ent
thought it better to be "ahead of China" than avoid extinction. Please for the love of God stop letting larger m odels get trained. We need a
global pause and if we don't stop now, we ALL die.
