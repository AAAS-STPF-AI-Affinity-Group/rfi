General Comment
AI is over-hyped, over-sold, and steals the hard work of creatives. If left unchecked, it will kill all artistic endeavors not just in Am erica
but in the world - why would a business spend m oney to hire an actual artist to ply their craft when they can have a plagiarism  program  do
it for free?
