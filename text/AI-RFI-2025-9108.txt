General Comment
The potential of AI has been greatly overstated. It does not create anything new, but only regurgitates the work of others in a random
form . Because it depends on writing, art, etc., created by others, but does not provide attribution or com pensation, it is essentially
plagiarism , and violates people’s copyright. Because it steals from  others’ intellectual property, it is dam aging to Am erican businesses.
Consider, for exam ple, that the Walt Disney com pany’s intellectual property would be dam aged, and even their reputation com prom ised,
by certain uses of AI. Im agine Mickey Mouse being used to sell others’ products, or Disney princesses “drawn” by AI in sexual contexts.
Copyright infringem ent by AI thus hinders their ability to do business with their products and brand. On the other hand, texts and im ages
generated by AI cannot be copyrighted. Therefore, they are ultim ately useless to any business that m ight generate them , since they cannot
be copyrighted, are not owned by the business, and the business therefore cannot benefit from  them , since anyone else can use them
freely. Given a choice between AI and protecting copyright, businesses and creators will ultim ately benefit m ore from  the latter. The
developm ent and use of AI m ust be subject to copyright law.
