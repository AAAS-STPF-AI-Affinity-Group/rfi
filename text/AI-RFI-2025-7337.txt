General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  the livelihoods of m ultiple Am ericans and profits off of theft. It is
nothing m ore than as passing phase that will die out in a m atter of a few years. Keep the copyrights to keep their theft illegal. Thank you
for reading.
