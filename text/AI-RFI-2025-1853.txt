General Comment
I'll keep m y com m ents brief. For over half a century, the United States has not only been a top leader in scientific innovation but also led
the world in culture and the arts. These are not coincidental achievem ents. From  the dom ination of superheroes at the box office to the
ubiquitousness of the cell phone, Am erica's cultural, scientific, and econom ic success has depended on its im agination. Without the stories
of Gene Roddenberry, in which his m ain characters used a handheld com m unicator, there would be no cell phone industry.
A key com ponent of Am erican im agination is that the fruits of that work will be rem unerated via copyright protection. To underm ine that
would disincentivize creativity. Giving the fruits of the Am erican im agination to Artificial Intelligence as fair-use training data would alienate
this country from  the very thing that has m ade it so successful.
