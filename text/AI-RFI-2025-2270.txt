General Comment
Generative AI is built on theft and only theft. Until we address this inherent truth we cannot allow its existence.
We strongly need regulations that are protecting creators and copyright holders. 
How are we supposed to continue to conduct business if the assum ption is that AI com panies are the ones who are going to profit from
our efforts and ideas? They cannot have these things for free
