General Comment
The current laws in place not only protect individualism  and creativity, but shareholder IP as well. If this is relinquished, the incentive for
com panies to continue creating works without their safety net will be com prom ised.
Furtherm ore, there should actually be stronger laws enacted to protect the Am erican people from  threats of their livelihoods being scraped
and regurgitated. This will decim ate not only m orale, but potentially jobs as well.
AI has its place, but to relinquish our work and inform ation just to stand a chance against international m arkets is outrageous.
