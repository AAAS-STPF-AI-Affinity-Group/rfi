General Comment
So called 'AI' is overhyped, glorified theft. Behind the glossy m arketing, it's actual effect on the world right now (and for the foreseeable
future) is exclusively negative. It's not even profitable. The bubble will burst, leaving only an infinitely worse internet, arts scene, and
inform ation landscape. Not to m ention a lot of good people out of work.
Governm ents should not be enabling this lunacy.
