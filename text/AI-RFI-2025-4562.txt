General Comment
In the strongest possible term s, I protest the idea of involving AI / LLM in the United States Governm ent.
AI is a speculative m arket product widely distrusted and despised by a m ajority of Am ericans. By definition, it is trained on stolen, illegally
acquired data, including copyrighted m aterial. It produces nothing of value, does horrific dam age to the environm ent, and threatens the
jobs of thousands if not m illions of Am ericans in creative fields. AI and LLMs have no place in the Am erican governm ent, and allowing AI
com panies im m unity from  prosecution would be an irreversible disaster for the country and the planet.
