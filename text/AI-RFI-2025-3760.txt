General Comment
Am erica's arts and entertainm ent industry is the m ost profitable in the world.
If copyright retroactively no longer applies to its works sim ply because their m odification is autom ated, the threat to gross dom estic
product - not to m ention national pride - will be existential.
Do not be fooled by people claim ing they are "training" their algorithm  or that it is "learning." All they did was steal copyrighted m aterial
and tell a m achine to m ash it together.
