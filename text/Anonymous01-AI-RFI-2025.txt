Should AI Be Capable of Forgetting? Strengthening Copyright in the Age of Generative AI
If generative AI (GenAI) truly “thinks” like a human, then it should also be capable of “forgetting” like one. While
AI does not possess memory in the human sense, AI models that have been trained on copyrighted works withoutconsent should be required to “unlearn” them, ensuring that creators retain full control over their intellectualproperty.
To regulate generative AI effectively within a capitalist framework (at least without stifling the industry around
generative AI entirely) copyright laws must be strengthened. AI companies offering for-profit generative modelsshould be legally required to implement mechanisms that remove copyrighted content upon request, giving artists,authors, and other creators meaningful recourse.
Copyright & Ownership in AI-Generated WorksAI-generated works should be eligible for copyright protection only when they involve significant human creative
input. Simple text prompts without meaningful post-processing should not qualify. While quantifying creativity ischallenging, a threshold of about 50% human modification through editing, refinement, or other artistictransformation should be required for copyright eligibility.
All AI-generated outputs that fail to meet this standard should be classified as non-copyrightable and made publicly
available, except in cases of copyright infringement. Outputs that violate copyright laws should not be sold ormonetized in any form, while those that do not infringe may be commercialized but must be clearly labeled as AI-generated.
Additionally, AI-generated works that have been significantly interpolated, f.e redrawn, repainted, or otherwise
substantially transformed, should be eligible for copyright protection, provided they are truly unique and notreplicable through the same prompt. This ensures that human creative effort remains central to intellectual propertyrights in the AI era.
Protecting Human Creatives from Direct Competition with AIArtists, authors, and creatives should not be forced into direct competition with generative AI models, as this would
devalue human creativity and undermine professional opportunities. Safeguarding creative industries requires fairmarket practices and clear regulations on the commercial use of AI-generated content:
- Mandatory Disclosure of AI Use: Companies utilizing AI-generated works should be required to clearly disclose
when and how AI is used. This transparency allows consumers and businesses to make informed decisions andprevents AI-generated content from being misrepresented as human-made.
- Restricting AI in Fields Where Human Creativity Is Integral: AI-generated content should not be used to replace
human labor in industries where artistic vision and craftsmanship are essential. For example, AI-generatedillustrations should not be directly substituted for commissioned artwork unless explicitly agreed upon by allinvolved parties.
- Incentives for Human-Made Creative Content:
 Governments should offer grants, tax breaks, or subsidies


for businesses and platforms that prioritize human-made creative works over AI-generated alternatives. This would
help sustain and strengthen creative industries, encouraging investment in human talent rather than relying solely on
AI-generated content.
Fair Licensing Agreements for AI Training
Building on the concept of AI “unlearning” or removing copyrighted content, licensing agreements between
copyright or intellectual property holders and AI companies should be fair, reasonable, and non-exploitative. Theseagreements should follow key principles:
- Reasonable Licensing Terms & Compensation:
 AI companies should be required to secure
proper licensing agreements before using copyrighted works for training. These agreements should ensure fair
financial compensation and reasonable timeframes that respect the creator’s rights.
- No Forced Transfers of Full Rights: AI companies should only obtain full rights to an artist’s, author’s, or creator’s
work with their explicit and voluntary agreement. No creator should be pressured into permanently surrenderingtheir rights to AI developers under exploitative terms.
- The Right to Revoke or Renegotiate Terms:
                                       Copyright holders should retain the ability to
renegotiate or revoke licensing agreements as AI technology evolves. This prevents creators from being locked into
outdated or unfair agreements and ensures they maintain control over their work long term.
So in the end, if AI “unlearning” proves to be a challenge, the ethical and legal principles behind it are very valid.
Many of the proposed measures are not dependent on whether AI can truly forget and should be implementedregardless, as they ensure creative professionals can continue to thrive alongside genAI models.
