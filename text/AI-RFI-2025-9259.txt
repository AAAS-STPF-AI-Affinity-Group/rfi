General Comment
If the goal of the plan is "sustaining and enhancing Am erica's AI dom inance," then we have an international responsibility to create a
sustainable AI system  that does not harm  hum ans, which includes the planet we live and sustain ourselves on. Currently, AI is powered by
sources that do exactly the opposite.
The only way AI can run harm lessly is with the express consent of the people that created its database - especially im age, text and
inform ation-generative AI. If you want your citizens to m ake m oney for you, they have to m ake enough m oney for them selves, and right
now AI is directly com peting with hum ans rather than just being a helpful tool for them . That's no way to build "econom ic
com petitiveness."
On top of that, if backend AI system s require so m any resources that it puts a strain on both the planet and our civil infrastructure, it
cannot possibly hold up on a physical level. "Hum an flourishing" depends on the health of the planet.
If I'm  going to be frank, I sim ply don't trust a governm ent to uphold our "national security" if they act against the best interests of its
people.
Why build a tower that's destined to crum ble? Where's the legacy in that?
