General Comment
This bill is nothing but a farce. Please for all that is good in the world, do not pass whatever bill this is. The world needs creative people to
be able to create freely & happily. OpenAI is nothing but a sham  & because big com panies are trying to push it, they are trying to m ake
only the m ost am ount of m oney possible without properly crediting creatives. 
While AI as a concept can be very useful in autom ating certain industrious & m echanical tasks, it has no place in the creative industry. The
creative industry is form ed by actual, hard working people, for people to enjoy such creative endeavors. 
We the people had so m uch be taken away from  us by the hands of big corporations, please don't let grifters take away our m eans of
creativity too.
