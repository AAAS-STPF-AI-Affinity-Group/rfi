General Comment
As an author of historical, I oppose the prem ises of this plan in strongest possible term s. Weakening copywrite protection for the explicit
purpose of allowing AI to turn out non-copywritable works will be a m assive, and alm ost irreparable blow to the US econom y. 
Even if we accept what is being proposed at face value, it's requesting a plan to destroy the country's future ability to create artistic works,
which powers the very AI the plans supporters are trying to create. This is nothing m ore than a proposal to eat our seed corn.
