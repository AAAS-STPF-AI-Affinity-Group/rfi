General Comment
Generative AI (or LLMs) have been illegally trained on copyright m aterials, but don't take m y word for it, but rather a form er OpenAI
em ployee - https://suchir.net/fair_use.htm l. We are already seeing the im pact of generative AI tools on creatives' incom e as well as
creatives decision to not share m aterial as they previously had to protect their incom e AND future incom e from  being stolen from
generative AI tools/m odels. Support of this plan is an act against the role of free m arkets and those m arkets' decisions of what should or
should not be successful. Looking for a brighter future for Am ericans requires less generative AI tools and support of said tools. These
tools/m odels actively degrade Am ericans' critical thinking skills and those skills are needed for Am erica to be a global leader
(https://www.m dpi.com /2075-4698/15/1/6). Or in other words, dim  Am erica's future. Furtherm ore, these tools are in the hands of a few
com panies without any regulations and there is absolutely no protection for anyone from  these tools (from  the slopification of inform ation
that they consum e to their rights to Nam e-Im age-Likeness used/rem aining in the m odels). Prom otion of generative AI is a prom otion of
increase scam m ers, deepfakes, and confusion/distrust of all Am ericans, particularly the elderly and the vulnerable. This plan is anti-
Am erican - it will put the power in the hands of a few, be harm ful to m any, and there has yet to be any m oney/revenue m ade by generative
AI tools while they grind up the work and incom e of others, the environm ent, and stress the US energy grid
(https://e360.yale.edu/features/artificial-intelligence-clim ate-energy-em issions). This plan should not be supported in any m anner. I strongly
oppose this plan due to the continuously harm  that generative AI tools will cause Am ericans and our country as a whole.
