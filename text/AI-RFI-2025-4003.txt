General Comment
Destroying copyright law for the sake of AI com panies will decim ate the entertainm ent and publishing industries, including textbook
publishing, which will have a catastrophic effect on Am erican higher education. Please understand that "AI training" is AI rem ixing, and AI
gets things wrong constantly. 
We are the global leader in m ovies, TV, m usic, and books, but if AI com panies get their way, we will not be in the future. That's because
if everyone's creative work can be stolen and rem ixed, creative people cannot m ake a living doing their work. In the long term , this is bad
for everyone, including AI com panies, because if no one is producing new creative work, the AIs will start training on them selves and the
quality will degrade. 
Copyright protections against AI are essential to keeping the Am erican econom y from  going into freefall, and the econom y is very fragile
already. 
Sincerely, 
Bryn
