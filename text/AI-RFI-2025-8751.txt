General Comment
Creators of copyrighted m aterials MUST be com pensated by entities aim ing to use them  for LLM/AI training. 
Com panies already relying on copyrighted m aterial in their dataset m ust be com pelled to com pensate creators retroactively, or face
penalties up to and including shutdown. 
Anything short of this constitutes theft, and would pose a colossal threat to hum an creative endeavor.
