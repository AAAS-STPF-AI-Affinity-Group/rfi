General Comment
AI is built on scraping and stealing others work. Whether it be artistically or otherwise, it is a cheap way to produce work without people
in m ind. How can there be innovation if AI is scraping what exists and never considering future changes? How will our econom y flourish if
creatives are out of jobs, sim ilar to the growing am ount of unem ployed people in the US due to “efficiency cuts”. Who isn’t im m une to
being cut when AI is used widely and without caution?
Additionally AI has been used for deep fakes to hurt people and forever change their lives, as im ages can som etim es look too real and put
people in com prising situations that actually never happened. 
The energy AI uses will also and has also put us on the fast track to destroy the beauty of this planet. Where will we live if Earth is gone?
Musk dream s of m ars but rationally, we m ight destroy our hom e before finding another one to then destroy, too. 
We need to take the funding for this and put it towards som ething useful that has been taken away, like protecting our national forests or
hiring back federal workers who help m ove processes in the governm ent.
