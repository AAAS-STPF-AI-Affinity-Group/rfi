General Comment
Hello,
I am  writing to express profound concern regarding the proposals subm itted by Google and OpenAI in response to the Request for
Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. While these com panies advocate for sustaining Am erica's
leadership in AI, their suggestions concerning copyright law pose a serious threat to the rights of creators and the ethical foundations of
our innovation econom y.
Protecting Creators’ Rights:
At the heart of our cultural and technological progress lies the respect for intellectual property. Copyright law grants creators exclusive
rights over their works, incentivizing creativity and ensuring that artists, writers, m usicians, and other creators can benefit from  their labor.
Google and OpenAI propose expanding the scope of "fair use" to allow unrestricted access to copyrighted m aterial for AI training without
consent or com pensation. This underm ines the fundam ental rights of creators and devalues their contributions.
Lim its of Fair Use:
The fair use doctrine is not a blanket exception perm itting corporations to exploit copyrighted works for com m ercial gain. It is intended for
specific purposes such as criticism , com m ent, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Utilizing vast am ounts of copyrighted
m aterial to train AI m odels that are then used for profit exceeds these bounds. Such practices infringe upon the exclusive rights of creators
and can dim inish the m arket for the original works, and displace the labor that creates it.
Econom ic and Ethical Im plications:
By using copyrighted works without authorization, these com panies gain financially while creators receive nothing, or are disadvantaged.
This threatens the livelihoods of those who rely on royalties and licensing fees. If creators cannot expect fair com pensation, there will be
less incentive to produce new works, leading to a decline in cultural richness, and risks com prom ising an industry which accounts for
billions of dollars annually of GDP. Disregarding the need for consent also raises serious ethical issues. The argum ent that obtaining
perm issions is im practical does not justify violating creators’ rights, and runs contrary to what OpenAI them selves have done by forging
license agreem ents with data providers through legal channels. Ethical AI developm ent m ust respect the autonom y of creators and involve
them  in decisions about how their works are used.
Avoiding a Race to the Bottom :
Using China as a rationale to weaken our copyright protections is a m anipulative tactic that encourages a dangerous race to the bottom .
While it's im portant to rem ain com petitive, com prom ising our ethical standards and legal protections is not the answer. Am erica should
lead by upholding strong intellectual property rights, setting a global exam ple, and fostering trust in our com m itm ent to justice and fairness.
Indeed, at this tim e, China has taking m ore steps in labeling AI content, and in providing m ore guidance that is favorable to rights-holders
than the US has.
Prom oting Ethical Innovation:
Innovation does not require sacrificing creators’ rights. We should prom ote AI developm ent that respects intellectual property,
encourages licensing agreem ents, and com pensates creators fairly. This approach fosters sustainable innovation and supports a vibrant
creative com m unity.


I urge the Office of Science and Technology Policy to:
- Uphold Strong Copyright Protections: Reject proposals that expand fair use beyond its intended purpose. Protect the exclusive rights of
creators to control their works.
- Encourage Ethical AI Developm ent: Support practices that obtain consent and provide fair com pensation to creators whose works are
used in AI training.
- Resist Manipulative Justifications: Do not allow international com petition to underm ine our ethical standards. Maintain Am erica’s
com m itm ent to the rule of law and individual rights.
- Ensure Econom ic Fairness for Creators: Explore m echanism s such as licensing fram eworks to ensure creators are com pensated when
their works contribute to AI m odels.
- Mandate Transparency and Accountability: Require AI developers to disclose the sources of their training data and establish oversight to
prevent unauthorized use of copyrighted m aterials.
By taking these steps, we can advance AI technology while preserving the rights of creators and upholding ethical standards. It is crucial
that we do not com prom ise our values in pursuit of technological progress.
Thank you for considering these concerns. I am  confident that, with thoughtful action, we can foster an environm ent where innovation and
creative expression thrive together.
Sincerely,
Bill L.
Aspiring artist
