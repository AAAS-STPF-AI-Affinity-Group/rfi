General Comment
Generative AI is a serious threat to the creative com m unity because it essentially steals the work of artists, writers, and m usicians. These
AI m odels are trained on a m assive am ount of existing content, m uch of which belongs to hum an creators who have put in years of hard
work and dedication, underm ining the very essence of creativity and originality.
It's frustrating to see AI generate text or art that closely resem bles the work of real creators, all while sidestepping the labor and
inspiration that goes into m aking truly unique pieces and real inform ation... like for this very com m ent...
...yes AI wrote the above which can clog your input so yeah, people who work for the governm ent like you reading this would likely don't
want that. Create regulation hard against AI or it'll be the age of m isinform ation.
