There are many dangerous applications for AI that seems to be being ignored for the interest of 
ego. Wha t about the scam calls that use AI generated voices to trick people into thinking their 
loved ones are in trouble? What about AI generated deep fakes that could lead people to believe an individual had done something when the "evidence" is a completely fabricated video? What about all of the artwork that has been stolen without permission from artists to train generative AI models? Why don't we focus on the security of the American people and our allies abroad from the harmful uses of AI before we rush ahead and let the people suffer until it's too late and too difficult to place regulations and protections? The urge of progress needs to be balanced with caution, otherwise we risk great harm to a great many people. Protect the people, artists, and the 
environment first before rushing head first to stroke ones ego.
