General Comment
AI needs to adhere to all copyright laws and be held to the sam e standard as other use. Otherwise, AI will steal the livelihood of artists
and m ake worse art. Generative AI is overhyped and produces substantially worse products that will decline over tim e as the artists who
created the original work can no longer afford to create new works. Additionally, no work generated by AI can be trusted to be factual
correct. AI is peak enshittification.
