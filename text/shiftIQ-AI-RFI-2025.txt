Introduction 
America stands at an unprecedented crossroads in the global AI competition—a moment 
when our choices will determine whether we lead or permanently cede technological 
leadership, economic prosperity, and geopolitical influence to China. Today’s AI choices are 
also not merely about competing with China; they also represent a critical test of our 
nation’s ability to protect American workers, revitalize our communities, safeguard existing 
industries, strengthen nation security, and establish democratic global leadership for 
decades. 
China’s aggressive, state-led AI strategy positions it to rapidly surpass the United 
States—not only in core AI technologies but across every sector AI influences. China's 
recent advancements, including open-source AI models, affordable open-source robotics, 
autonomous systems, custom AI hardware (non-GPU), and STEM talent pipelines, represent 
foundational elements of their expansive approach. Recognizing AI's potential to influence 
nearly 50% of global GDP , as recently forecasted by Chinese tech giant Alibaba,1 China has 
aligned substantial state resources behind its AI strategy, announcing an unprecedented 
$128 billion USD (¥1 trillion yuan) venture guidance fund alongside its established 
semiconductor-focused 'Big Fund.'2  These state-backed investments, combined with an 
inclusive open-source strategy,  aim to secure China's dominance across a vast range of

industries, posing a multifaceted threat to American economic competitiveness, national 
security, and geopolitical influence. 
Despite bipartisan acknowledgment of AI’s existential stakes, recent official assessments 
have presented overly optimistic views that obscure America’s true competitive standing. 
Outgoing National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan confidently declared the United States 
"firmly in the lead" on AI, calling it "the single most dramatic development in human affairs in 
quite some time."3 While optimism is understandable, history warns against misplaced 
confidence, recalling a similar assurance from Sullivan of "peace and stability in the Middle 
East.” This occurred just prior to regional upheaval. Weeks after Sullivan’s ‘firmly in the lead’ 
remarks, lightning struck again and China’s DeepSeek AI model dramatically demonstrated 
how quickly realities can shift. 
In stark contrast, Vice President J.D. Vance, representing the incoming administration, 
recently underscored a more sobering reality: "If we don't fundamentally change our 
approach, China's dominance in AI will become irreversible."4 Vice President Vance's 
assessment underscores a critical bipartisan consensus—America urgently requires a 
transformative shift in its AI strategy, and this impacts critical industries. 
To succeed, America's definition of victory must go beyond technological superiority or 
short-term corporate profitability. Winning the AI competition means strategically 
investing in an inclusive, expansive innovation ecosystem that: 
●Creates high-quality, sustainable jobs across socioeconomic levels and communities
nationwide.
●Prioritizes reshoring and revitalizing critical American industries, while protecting
existing sectors from displacement by foreign AI-driven competitors.
●Secures alignment with neutral countries by establishing democratic technological
standards globally, preventing these nations from dependence on China's AI
ecosystem.
●Catalyzes broad-based community gains, reversing decades of manufacturing and
economic decline and supports regional economic renewal.
●Ensures widespread and inclusive economic benefits, directly enhancing the
livelihoods of all Americans rather than narrowly enriching a concentrated elite.
Today, America’s AI ecosystem remains overly concentrated within a small number of 
well-funded incumbent firms, often closed-source and limiting broader economic

participation. One company directly and through its customers, Nvidia, has captured 90% 
plus of the market in AI hardware.5  
History repeatedly demonstrates the danger of incumbent-focused policies, which have 
resulted in stagnation and permanent loss of competitiveness across critical 
industries—automotive manufacturing (GM bailouts), solar energy programs, 
telecommunications, and battery production, among others. By contrast, China has 
executed plans prioritizing agile, disruptive startups, rapidly creating entirely new 
industries. In automotive manufacturing, for instance, while U.S. policies preserved 
outdated incumbents, China invested in new companies like BYD, XPeng, and NIO, 
becoming the largest exporter in the world.6  
However, AI uniquely introduces a new reality: unlike previous eras, economic competition 
is no longer primarily determined by labor availability or market-driven corporate 
profitability alone, but rather by the efficient and strategic allocation of capital into 
AI-driven technologies. Generative AI democratizes software development talent globally, 
rapidly eroding America’s traditional human-capital advantage. Simultaneously, AI 
reshapes entire sectors—manufacturing, robotics, autonomous systems—either 
complementing or substituting human labor at unprecedented scale. This profound shift 
means that the nations able to intentionally deploy capital into transformative AI 
technologies will decisively reshape markets, capture global economic sectors, and secure 
geopolitical dominance. 
AI’s transformative potential presents America with two dramatically different pathways: ● Automation-Driven Path (Negative Scenario) : Predominantly automates existing 
middle-to-high-income jobs, temporarily boosting corporate profits but causing 
significant unemployment, economic inequality, and further hollowing out America’s 
industrial base.  
 
● Innovation-Driven Path (Positive Scenario) : Prioritze reshoring critical 
industries, stimulates entirely new economic sectors, creates high-value, sustainable 
jobs nationwide, and actively protects existing industries from foreign technological 
displacement. This path fosters sustained economic dynamism, wide-spread wealth, 
and revitalization of American manufacturing and communities. 
America's AI Action Plan must embrace this positive innovation-driven scenario, 
intentionally prioritizing disruptive startups, open-source ecosystems, inclusive STEM 
education, more affordable non-GPU infrastructure, plentiful energy, and robust domestic

manufacturing. The stakes are clear and existential—continued incumbent-centric policies 
risk permanently ceding economic and geopolitical influence to China. 
America now faces an historic opportunity—and moral responsibility—to leverage AI 
innovation, safeguard American jobs, secure neutral nations within a democratic 
technological ecosystem, and deliver sustained, inclusive prosperity for all Americans. The 
moment for bold leadership, decisive investment, and inclusive economic renewal is now. 
Context and Current Global Landscape 
The global artificial intelligence landscape is evolving rapidly, reshaping economic, military, 
and geopolitical realities in ways comparable to historical transformations such as 
electrification, nuclear technology, or the internet. Today, the AI competition between the 
United States and China represents not merely technological rivalry, but a defining 
geopolitical struggle for the remainder of the 21st century. 
To effectively respond, America must prioritize diversification in AI hardware 
infrastructure, reducing dependence on incumbent GPU-centric ecosystems. Emerging 
custom AI hardware innovations are now offering a viable, cost-effective path to 
democratize advanced AI capabilities nationwide. It’s also part of our energy solution. 
The Economic and Geopolitical Stakes of AI 
The global economy will be fundamentally reshaped by AI. By 2030, AI is projected to add 
approximately $15.7 trillion to global GDP , with China set to capture the largest share 
(approximately 26%) if current trends persist.7 This far exceeds the forecasted contribution 
of the United States (~14%), underscoring an unprecedented shift in global economic 
power toward China. 
Beyond economics, AI's potential military and implications are enormous. From 
autonomous weapons systems and advanced intelligence capabilities to pervasive cyber 
operations, AI capabilities directly translate into military and geopolitical strength. Nations 
leading in AI will shape global standards, cybersecurity protocols, supply chains, and 
technological alliances—cementing their global influence.

Lessons Learned from Historical Mistakes 
Repeatedly, America has lost critical industries by relying excessively on incumbent 
corporations and entrenched interests rather than fostering disruptive innovation: 
●Automotive Industry (2008) : The U.S. auto bailout preserved incumbent
corporations (GM, Chrysler), but sustained outdated models, losing global market
share and competitiveness. Conversely, China invested aggressively in new
automotive companies (BYD, XPeng, NIO), transforming itself into the world’s
largest exporter of electric vehicles.8
●Solar Industry: America’s incumbent-oriented investments (e.g., Solyndra) led to
stagnation and market collapse. China's startup-driven investments rapidly captured
approximately 80% of the global solar manufacturing market, decisively overtaking
U.S. producers.9
●Battery Technology:  U.S. incumbents received funding that was insufficient and
slow, resulting in America lagging significantly behind. China's strategic funding for
battery innovators (CATL) now dominates global battery production, with
approximately 70-90% global market share.10
These cases clearly illustrate the risks inherent in incumbent-focused investment 
strategies: incremental progress, stagnation of innovation, and ultimately, irreversible 
competitive decline. 
China’s AI Advantages: An Integrated Approach 
China is replicating its past success across key AI technologies, moving quickly to 
consolidate leadership in several critical areas: 
●Open-Source AI Models: China's open-source models (DeepSeek and Alibaba's
Qwen) have rapidly proliferated globally due to their transparency, accessibility, and
cost-effectiveness, directly challenging American companies with closed-source
strategies like OpenAi’s Chatgpt, xAi’s Groq, and Anthropic’s Claude.
●General-Purpose Robotics and Manufacturing:  Chinese companies like Unitree
Robotics are not only developing advanced, general-purpose robotic systems but
rapidly commercializing and deploying them internationally. China’s manufacturing
sector already significantly outpaces U.S. manufacturing efficiency due to robotics,

automation, and full-scale deployments of autonomous systems.11 
● Hardware Infrastructure: China is actively investing not only in GPU hardware, but 
also non-GPU-based AI hardware alternatives (FPGA and ASIC/LPU architectures), 
directly circumventing expensive Nvidia GPU ecosystems.12 These technologies offer 
substantial performance, cost, and efficiency advantages, enabling Chinese firms to 
rapidly scale AI innovation without dependency on Western components. This is an 
all in CCP program.  
● Talent Expansion: China’s state-driven expansion of university admissions targets 
STEM and AI education, significantly increasing its talent pool to meet national 
goals. Leading universities like Peking University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University 
have substantially expanded their AI and engineering programs, ensuring a 
sustained and superior AI talent pipeline compared to the U.S..13 
● Global Leadership in AI Standards: Through proactive leadership in setting global 
standards—particularly via open-source platforms—China is positioning itself to 
influence global infrastructure and economic alliances. Adopters of China's 
standards could become locked into China-centric AI ecosystems, further solidifying 
China’s long-term geopolitical influence. 
A Sobering Reality 
The historical context combined with China’s comprehensive strategy underscores a 
sobering reality: America risks repeating past errors by continuing incumbent-focused 
policies exemplified by the CHIPS Act. The United States urgently needs a bold new 
approach prioritizing disruptive innovation, agile new entrants, diversified hardware 
infrastructure beyond GPU incumbents like Nvidia, proactive reshoring strategies through 
robotics, and significant expansion of STEM-focused talent pipelines. 
Our recommendations in this submission directly respond to these lessons, offering a clear 
path to regain global AI leadership, secure critical industries, and achieve broad-based 
economic prosperity. America must urgently act upon these insights or face permanent 
economic and geopolitical decline. 
 America's Imperative: Innovation Over Incumbency 
13 https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-top-universities-expand-enrolment-beef-up-capabilities-ai-strategic-areas-2025-03-10/ 12https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3301251/chinese-ai-team-wins-global-award-replacing-nvidia-gpu-industrial-chip 11 https://semianalysis.com/2025/03/11/america-is-missing-the-new-labor-economy-robotics-part-1/

America’s most transformative economic and technological achievements have historically 
arisen not from protecting incumbent corporations, but from deliberately empowering 
visionary startups and fostering broad-based innovation ecosystems accessible to diverse 
participants. Ensuring AI success demands this same inclusive approach, broadening 
opportunities for smaller companies and regional innovators currently outside the 
incumbent-centric circles dominating AI today. Consider the Apollo program, which 
propelled U.S. aerospace dominance; DARPA’s foundational role in creating the internet; 
and, most recently, transformative companies such as Tesla (AI company), SpaceX, and 
Palantir (AI company). Each vividly illustrates how government backing of visionary 
startups—not incumbents—can reshape global industries and secure lasting technological 
leadership. 
Tesla’s success, for instance, was catalyzed through crucial early U.S. government 
assistance, notably a pivotal  $465 million loan from the Department of Energy’s Advanced 
Technology Vehicle Manufacturing program.14 In addition, Tesla along with other EV 
companies customers received substantial earlier tax credits in states like California. 
Similarly, SpaceX—today's leader in commercial space exploration—rapidly scaled due to 
government funding, including a $396 million NASA contract in 2006.15 Similarly, the AI 
company Palantir benefited substantially from early-stage government contracts, 
leveraging federal support to establish itself as a leading force in data analytics critical to 
U.S. national security. 
However, recent U.S. strategies have significantly diverged from this historically successful 
model. Policies like the CHIPS Act predominantly channel vast funds toward entrenched 
incumbents—such as Intel, Nvidia, and TSMC—instead of nurturing new startups and 
disruptive technologies. History demonstrates that incumbent-focused strategies 
consistently yield incremental results at best, and stagnation or outright loss of leadership 
at worst, as evidenced by America's struggles in automotive manufacturing, telecom 
infrastructure, solar panels, and battery technologies. 
China, in sharp contrast, has been directing substantial investments into agile, disruptive 
startups, aggressively capturing sectors and reshaping global markets. China’s coordinated 
state-backed investments—including the new landmark $128 billion USD (¥1 trillion yuan) 
innovation fund and the "Big Fund," its well-known semiconductor industry investment 
initiative—are designed to nurture innovative AI ecosystems. By prioritizing agile, 
innovative startups rather than incumbents, China is rapidly dominating critical AI and 
technology sectors, positioning itself to define global economic and technological standards 
for decades to come. 15 https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-spacex-became-nasas-go-to-ride-orbit 14 https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-gets-loan-approval-us-department-energy 
7  ShiftIQ Action Plan Submitted to National Coordination Office (NCO)      


Remarkably, China's approach has even successfully attracted and leveraged American 
innovation. Tesla’s $1.6 billion investment in its Shanghai Gigafactory was actively 
supported and facilitated by Chinese governmental incentives, streamlined regulatory 
approvals, and dedicated infrastructure support.16 This allowed China to quickly build a 
world-class EV supply chain domestically, enhancing its global automotive dominance while 
simultaneously weakening America's competitive position. Such moves illustrate the 
urgency with which America must prioritize nurturing and retaining innovative ecosystems 
domestically, rather than allowing U.S.-born innovations to fuel foreign competitiveness. 
America must decisively embrace an innovation-driven approach, investing in technologies 
aimed not merely at short-term corporate profitability but at long-term economic 
revitalization, reshoring industries, and job creation. Such a strategy will not only position 
America to win the geopolitical AI competition with China, but also dramatically improve 
the lives and livelihoods of American citizens, revitalizing communities across the nation. 
The alternative—continued reliance on incumbent-focused strategies—risks repeating 
historic mistakes that have hollowed out American manufacturing and permanently 
weakened our economic and technological leadership. 
The stakes could not be higher: America’s long-term economic security, technological 
leadership, and the prosperity of future generations depend on decisively choosing this 
path of bold innovation and economic renewal. 
Recommendations: Investing in America’s Innovation 
Ecosystem for Broad-Based Economic Renewal 
Given the stark landscape outlined, America requires immediate, decisive action directed 
toward fostering robust innovation ecosystems. Rather than merely investing in incumbent 
corporations or selecting technologies that promise short-term profitability alone, the 
following recommendations focus national policy on creating sustained economic benefits 
for everyday Americans, reshoring industries, fostering community economic renewal, and 
broadly distributing AI’s gains across American society. 
1. Establish a $100 Billion National Innovation Fund for Community and
Regional Revitalization
16https://electrek.co/2019/12/26/tesla-secures-billion-financing-gigafactory-china/#:~:text=Tesla%20confirms%20it%20secured%20%241.6%20b

8  ShiftIQ Action Plan Submitted to National Coordination Office (NCO)      


 
America must urgently launch a $100 billion National Innovation Fund over five years, 
designed to nurture 1,000 disruptive startups and create 500,000 high-quality American 
jobs. Unlike incumbent-focused policies such as the CHIPS Act, this fund prioritizes startups 
and innovative ventures committed to reshoring critical industries, revitalizing local 
communities, and ensuring sustained economic growth nationwide. Through targeted seed 
investments, grants, and incentives focused on regional manufacturing resurgence and 
affordable automation, this approach will ensure AI-driven gains benefit all 
Americans—not just a select tech elite. Let's foster broad-based innovation and secure a 
strong investment return for America’s future. 
Documented examples: 
● China's $128 billion innovation VC fund. 
● Successful U.S. precedents: Tesla’s $465 million DOE loan, SpaceX’s $396 million 
NASA contract, and Palantir’s early federal support. 
2. Democratize and Diversify AI Hardware Infrastructure 
America must reduce dependence on costly and vulnerable GPU-centric solutions 
dominated by incumbents like Nvidia. Federal investments should support alternative 
architectures—including FPGA-based systems, ASICs, and other innovative non-GPU 
hardware—making advanced AI capabilities more affordable, accessible, and broadly 
available. This diversification lowers entry barriers for startups, small businesses, 
universities, and local innovators, significantly accelerating regional innovation and 
broadening economic participation. 
To scale this initiative, America should establish a $50 billion National AI Infrastructure 
Accelerator  by 2028, funding not only hardware innovation, but 20 GW of distributed 
regional data centers powered by renewable and nuclear energy projects. Inspired by the 
transformative 1956 Interstate Highway Act, this Accelerator will create approximately 
250,000 jobs, accelerate AI and robotics deployment, and ensure that affordable computing 
resources are accessible nationwide. This proactive strategy directly counters China's 
expansive hardware investments and helps secure America's long-term technological 
competitiveness. 
Documented Example: China's investment in FPGA-based infrastructure (e.g., DeepSeek) 
to circumvent Nvidia GPU dependency.17

9                                                               ShiftIQ Action Plan Submitted to National Coordination Office (NCO)       


3. Launch a National Open-Source AI Initiative
The US must champion open-source AI through a national initiative, strategically 
democratizing technology access and empowering small businesses, local startups, and 
regional economic ecosystems nationwide. An explicit commitment to open-source AI 
platforms ensures transparency, affordability, and broad-based accessibility, directly 
fostering local innovation, economic growth, and inclusive technological leadership that 
benefits communities broadly rather than reinforcing corporate monopolies or exclusivity. 
While large corporations currently dominate the American AI landscape, launching a robust 
national initiative for open-source AI platforms would substantially broaden participation, 
accelerate innovation, and democratize AI capabilities across smaller businesses, startups, 
academia, and regional manufacturers. This inclusivity directly aligns with the 
administration's objective to ensure AI-driven wealth benefits all Americans, rather than a 
select few. 
Documented example: China's global open-source leadership (Qwen and DeepSeek). 
4. Prioritize General-Purpose Robotics for Regional Manufacturing
Federal investments should target general-purpose robotics to enable flexible and 
affordable automation, reshoring diverse manufacturing industries. Clear federal initiatives 
must  support not only large manufacturers but regional, mid-sized, and smaller 
manufacturers. By prioritizing general-purpose robotics, America can significantly enhance 
its industrial capabilities, create quality American jobs, and broadly revitalize regional 
communities hollowed out by past offshoring. 
By prioritizing accessible, cost-effective general-purpose robotics, America can quickly 
scale advanced manufacturing capabilities, particularly benefiting regions historically 
disadvantaged by industrial decline. This move aligns with bipartisan goals of reshoring 
manufacturing and creating broadly accessible, quality employment opportunities across 
diverse American communities. 
Documented example: China’s success rapidly scaling robotics (Unitree Robotics). 
5. Expand Inclusive STEM and AI Education Nationwide
Explicit federal funding should substantially expand STEM and AI education programs, 
ensuring equitable geographic distribution and target underserved and rural communities. 
Grants and incentives should prioritize expanded AI curriculum in public schools, 
community college vocational training, and university STEM programs. An inclusive talent 10  ShiftIQ Action Plan Submitted to National Coordination Office (NCO)      


pipeline will empower a broad spectrum of Americans, ensuring that economic benefits 
from AI-driven innovation are broadly shared across all regions and communities, 
revitalizing areas historically left behind. 
To ensure broad-based economic benefits, federal initiatives must not only increase the 
number of STEM graduates but diversify the geographic and socioeconomic representation 
within AI education, particularly targeting historically underrepresented regions and 
populations. This broadening of access aligns directly with the administration's goal of 
inclusive economic renewal and technological leadership. 
Documented example: China's expansion of STEM/AI university enrollment (Peking 
University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University).
6. Adopt AI-Focused Federal Procurement Supporting Small Innovators
Federal procurement policies should prioritize acquiring AI solutions and technologies 
from innovative startups and emerging firms—not merely established incumbents. 
Procurement guidelines and contracts should favor agile, innovative American companies 
whose business models align with reshoring manufacturing and domestic job creation. 
Similar targeted government procurement historically catalyzed industry-leading 
innovations, as demonstrated by Tesla, SpaceX, and Palantir, ultimately generating 
thousands of high-quality jobs and reshaping industries globally. 
Documented examples: ●Tesla’s $465 million DOE loan
●SpaceX’s early NASA contracts
●Palantir’s federal partnerships.
7. Align AI Strategy with Community and Worker Interests
America’s national AI strategy must prioritize technologies, deployments, and investments 
that directly benefit American workers and communities, rather than narrowly serving 
corporate profitability. Clear federal incentives, grants, and policies should support AI 
technologies designed to reshore jobs, revitalize communities, and build economic 
resilience locally. Explicitly avoiding indiscriminate automation, America's AI Action Plan 
should prioritize innovation that directly enhances workers’ livelihoods, reversing the 
damaging hollowing-out effects historically caused by offshoring manufacturing. 
Documented example: Negative historical examples of manufacturing offshoring 
consequences on American communities clearly documented. 
11  ShiftIQ Action Plan Submitted to National Coordination Office (NCO)      


 
8. Establish a Voluntary National AI Security Alliance 
To safeguard America’s AI leadership against national security risks posed by adversaries 
like China (e.g., DeepSeek’s potential misuse), America must proactively assess frontier AI 
models without stifling innovation. We recommend establishing a Voluntary National AI 
Security Alliance, led by NIST and the Department of Defense, partnering with startups and 
labs to evaluate models for risks such as cybersecurity breaches or biological weapon 
development. This lightweight, optional framework—modeled on successful public-private 
collaborations like the Apollo program—provides classified threat intelligence to 
participants and ensures safety without burdensome mandates. By equipping innovators 
with tools to mitigate risks (e.g., cyber threats identified in Claude 3.7 Sonnet tests), this 
alliance strengthens U.S. defenses while fostering trust in AI deployment, ensuring 
America’s technological edge remains secure and competitive globally. 
Documented example: Anthropic’s voluntary security exercises with U.S./U.K. AI Safety 
Institutes. 
9. Lead a Democratic AI Standards Coalition 
America should lead global AI governance by launching a Democratic AI Standards 
Coalition aligned with G7 and NATO countries. With an initial $10 million seed fund, this 
coalition would set open-source norms—ensuring transparency and accessibility for 
smaller businesses—while promoting democratic values and economic fairness. 
Coordinating export controls and safety benchmarks with international allies will prevent 
China from locking nations into its authoritarian AI ecosystems, solidifying U.S. leadership 
in global standards-setting bodies (e.g., ISO). Such leadership helps American startups 
thrive globally, reinforcing America's technological advantage. 
Documented Example: Google's NIST-led standards aligning with ISO 42001. 
 Conclusion: America's Moment of Strategic Clarity and 
Economic Renewal 
America stands at a historic crossroads—facing decisions about artificial intelligence that 
will shape our economy, national security, and global influence for generations. The stakes 
are clear: without decisive leadership, the U.S. risks permanently ceding AI dominance to 
China, repeating past strategic failures in automotive, solar, battery, and 
telecommunications industries, where incumbent-focused investments led to stagnation 
and irreversible loss.

However, America has proven before—with visionary government backing—that bold, 
targeted support for disruptive innovators can secure global industry leadership and drive 
widespread prosperity. 
The incoming administration faces a historic responsibility and an extraordinary 
opportunity: it must urgently embrace innovation-driven strategies that democratize AI, 
empower agile startups, revitalize regional economies, and deliver inclusive economic gains 
to all Americans—not just entrenched incumbents or concentrated elites. Only by explicitly 
prioritizing innovation, inclusive participation, robust job creation, expanded STEM 
education, and regional economic renewal can America reestablish global AI leadership, 
win critical neutral countries to democratic technological standards, and secure sustained, 
inclusive prosperity for generations. 
The choice is clear and urgent. Let this moment define a new era of American innovation, 
economic revitalization, and democratic leadership. The time for bold vision and decisive 
action is now.
