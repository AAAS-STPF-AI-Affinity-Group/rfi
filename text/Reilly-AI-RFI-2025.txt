Artificial Intelligence sucks. It should be outlawed. Any plan to unleash the private sector in the name of “improving
AI” is profoundly and dangerously misguided. This is a snake-oil fad that solves few, if any, problems, but createsnearly limitless others. We should not be beholden to the dull groupthink of glossy-eyed and empty-headed siliconvalley executives who have managed to convince themselves of the almighty power of the calculator. They aredeluded, and anyone who believes in the importance of AI is deluded. We need to stop shoveling money into thisbottomless pit. The action plan should, in a sane world, be to stop wasting time, money, and effort on something soobviously anti-human and ineffectual.
