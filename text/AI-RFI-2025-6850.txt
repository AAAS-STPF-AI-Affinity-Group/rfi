General Comment
To say this would be a disaster is an understatem ent. Artificial intelligence has no purpose in the United States and only serves to harm  her
people and their livelihood. It profits off of the theft of original ideas and property, and has been shown tim e and tim e again to be both
unreliable and unpopular. To allow Big Tech to be com pletely above the law for the sake of their AI m odels is a disgusting and disgraceful
act, and should be shot down.
