General Comment
An an illustrator and artist of other digital m edium s, I know with all of m y creative heart that stealing works from  artists, creators, and
whatever other designations need to be included on the subject of those who take the tim e to create som ething from  nothing is wrong,
both ethically and m orally. If AI is to exist solely from  m im icking and assim ilating the hard work and im m utable brilliance of hum an beings,
it cannot be included as a part of the creative process, as it violates the very ideal of copyright, tradem ark, and the ownership of any work
created outside of a m achine throwing som e ideas together until it looks good enough.
If the United States truly wants to lead the world with regards to artificial intelligence, we m ust innovate in ways to use AI to truly create
better end products while leaving the work of artists and creators alone.
