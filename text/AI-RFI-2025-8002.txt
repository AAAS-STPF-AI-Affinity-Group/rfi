General Comment
Do not do this. This is in terrible violation of copyright law. By requesting this inform ation, AI will be able to steal things from  hardworking
Am ericans and the copyright-holding corporations that m ake up this nation. It is in violation of Am erican *freedom * to have this law go
into effect.
