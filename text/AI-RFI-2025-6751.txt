General Comment
Generative artificial intelligence has no place in Am erica. It's wasteful, thought-term inating, and m ore often than not flat-out wrong. And if
that weren't bad enough, it's designed from  the ground up to profit from  theft. Creative people should not have their hard work stolen and
ground up into slop to feed these m achines. Open AI and other com panies should not get to profit off of that stolen work. There's nothing
that a generative AI m odel can do that can't be done better, m ore efficiently, and m ore ethically by sim ply paying a hum an being to do the
work.
