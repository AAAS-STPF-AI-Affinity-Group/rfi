General Comment
Let m e put this plain and sim ple: 
If your product requires the THEFT of copyrighted m aterial, out died not deserve to succeed. 
Real people have spent their entire careers producing art, m usic, articles, and m ore, and their property should be protected.
If a regular person were to steal all that work and start m aking copies or am algam ations of it, they'd be fined or put in jail. 
I don't give a dam n what a com pany or even our governm ent wants to do with AI. If you can't legally and ethically source your data,
YOUR PRODUCT DO NOT DESERVE TO EXIST.
