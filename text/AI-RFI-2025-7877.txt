General Comment
This request should be unequivocally denied. It’ll only lead to generative AI continuing to steal the work of actual artists and people, as
well as being overall worse than the products it copies. AI can be used to im prove the lives of everyone if used correctly, and that’s why it
m ust stay regulated and restricted on what it can and can’t do.
