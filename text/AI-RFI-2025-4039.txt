General Comment
I do not believe that com panies should be allowed to use copyrighted m aterial in the developm ent of their AI. Copyrighted m aterial
belongs to the one who holds the copyright and they m ust give consent to have their works used in this way. To allow com panies to do
otherwise would destroy the creative sector as we know it, costing num erous people their jobs and livelihoods.
