General Comment
To allow Artificial Intelligence (AI) to train on copyrighted works without the EXPRESS approval of the copyright holders is theft. It
devalues Am erican labor and puts artists, writers and other creatives out of business. To offer no com pensation for creators whose works
are used to train AI is theft. The guardrails are there for a reason and it's to protect Am erican jobs, not m ake life harder for Sam  Altm an
and others who are pushing AI as the wave of the future. Allowing OpenAI, ChatGPT and other AIs unlim ited access to all copyrighted
works to train their AI is not going to m ake AI better, it's only going to ruin Am erica's creative econom y.
