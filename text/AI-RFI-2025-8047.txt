General Comment
The hype around Artificial Intelligence is destructive to business from  m any angles. Ignoring copyright steals m oney from  both people and
corporations and does not provide them  a benefit. These com panies m arket them selves with ram pant speculation and are charging
custom ers for prom ised products that do not exist. Even with their m assive data sets, current m odels provide accurate responses less than
half the tim e. These technologies need decades of refinem ent and advances in other areas of com puter science and technology (such as
m em ory density, power efficiency) to be feasibly useful. Giving them  perm ission to ignore copyright will not speed things up. They have
already BEEN ignoring copyright and they have hit the lim it of their usefulness.
It is frankly absurd that one com pany (for exam ple, Open AI), is allowed to ignore laws in order to m ake a profit from  com panies that
have followed the law. It could perhaps be forgiven for a solely intellectual endeavor, such as experim entation at an educational institution.
It is nonsensical to think one business should be allowed to steal from  another, and insulting to think they should be able to then profit from
that theft.
