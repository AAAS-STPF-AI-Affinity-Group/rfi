General Comment
Please consider that AI is used to steal the hard work of citizens and can be very detrim ental to work spaces. Many have already felt the
negative effects of AI, such as it being used to plagiarize work. There should be strict guidelines in place to prevent AI from  being used for
whatever purposes users deem  fit. The priority should be to protect real, hard working hum ans from  AI. We should not be enabling AI to
openly steal from  Hum ans.
