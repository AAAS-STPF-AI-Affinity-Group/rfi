My name is Curi Lagann, I am a freelance artist, and I oppose this plan with all of my being.
This plan is based on taking everything and anyone's information against the will of mostpeople and organizations. The worst part is they do it without the victims even knowing, thisbypasses everyone's right to keep their own information, data, and hard work from beingstolen.
It's sickening how something like this is even up for debate, it's stomping over every person's
rights. My life's work, my 30+ years of blood sweat and tears learning a craft could be stolen,recreated, and used by giant corperations and government just so they can use it in griftsdisguised as "the future". Shame on anyone who thinks this is a good idea, the amount ofenergy and damage done to the enviroment in order to power these technologies is badenough, but on top of that it necessitates theft on a scale not yet seen or understood byhumans.
Do not go through with this, do not let AI dictate what is and isn't ok to steal
