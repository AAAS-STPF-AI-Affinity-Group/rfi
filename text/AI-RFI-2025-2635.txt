General Comment
GENAI and AI resources should rem ain restricted. AI learning should only be done with openly public resources and not private works
or works from  places not owned by dom ains trying to train their AI m odels. If AI m odels use work from  sources and do not notify said
sources, that should be considered theft, especially when AI is not transparent on where they obtain their learning sources. AI learning that
uses resources and are not fully transparent on where they obtain said sources should be punished by the law. If there are no laws to
punish AI, they should be m ade in order to protect the assets of the people, organizations, and private creators who are unknowingly
being abused and stolen from . The new AI Action Plan is overwhelm ingly abusive and strips the liberties of the people, taking away basic
liberties of ownership and the ability for people to stand for them selves and their own works.
