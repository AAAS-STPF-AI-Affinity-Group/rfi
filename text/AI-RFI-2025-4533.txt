General Comment
I find this very silly. If large com panies have the right to protect their own services and copyrights from  exploitation and piracy, I don’t
think they should be given im m unity to steal others.
Everything and everyone is “publicly available,” consent to interact with them  is a different and m ost im portant m atter.
