General Comment
AI has been and continues to steal from  hardworking folks and then turns around and profits off of them . People have had it drilled into
them  from  birth that stealing is wrong, and yet you'd let it happen to those very sam e people? Sham e on you. Generative AI is stupidly
overhyped.
