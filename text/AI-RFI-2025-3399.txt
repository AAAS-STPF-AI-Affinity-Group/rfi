General Comment
Generative AI unam biguously relies on the theft of digital resources and assets from  hard-working, uncredited hum ans. Every group that
already uses Generative AI does not care about the harm  it can cause, instead only caring about m aking a profit for them selves. Rem oving
restrictions would only worsen the already predatory practices that com panies and private individuals engage in by using Generative AI.
