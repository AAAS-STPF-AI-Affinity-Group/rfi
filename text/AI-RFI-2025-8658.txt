General Comment
Any further developm ent of AI in Am erica needs guardrails in place. It is unacceptable to think that we would continue to allow
com panies to steal the work of countless others in order to train AI m odels with no regard for copyright laws. The governm ent should not
shield these com panies from  consequences. Surely, if AI is truly the revolutionary technology its creators tout it to be, there is a way to
continue its developm ent lawfully and --at the very least-- credit and fairly com pensate the original creators of the source m aterials it is
trained on. To do anything otherwise would m ean the United States governm ent is openly allowing and encouraging tech billionaires to
brazenly com m it theft.
