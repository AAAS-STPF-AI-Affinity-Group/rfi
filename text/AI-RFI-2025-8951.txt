General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States. It profits off of theft, and steals from  the livelihood of m yself and m any
other Am ericans. The public needs proper safeguards, and should be properly com pensated for the use of copyrighted training data.
Rem oving guardrails and developing AI without safeguards and com pensation would be disastrous. It is an unethical, dangerous, and
honestly em barrassing precedent to establish. This will not benefit our national security.
The Am erican people deserve better.
We donâ€™t need or want AI.
