Subject: Input on the Developm ent of an AI Action Plan 
Dear Mr. D'Souza, 
I am writing to provide my input on the developm ent of the Artificial Intelligence ( AI) Action 
Plan as part of the Reques t for Informat ion (RFI) issued by the Natio nal Science 
Foundation, on behalf of the Office of Science and Technolog y Polic y (OSTP). This request 
is made in accordance wit h President Trump's Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence , 
issue d on Februar y 25, 2025, which directs the developm ent of a n AI Actio n Plan t o sustain 
and enhance America ’s global leadership in AI technolog y innovation. 
As a researc her specializing in the use of AI in healthcare, particular ly in the predictio n of 
chronic diseases and the applicatio n of multi-omics data, I would like t o off er the following 
suggestions to help shape the future of AI polic y in the U nited States: 
1.Integration of Multi -Omics Data for Risk Prediction in Chronic Diseases
I propose that the AI Action Plan includes policies that support the use of multi -
omics approaches  (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.) to improve the
prediction and prevention of chronic diseases. By integrating these data types, we
can develop more accurate and personalized predictive models, which will benefit
both public health and biomedical research.
2.AI for Early Diagnosis and Personalized Treatment in Chronic Diseases
I recommend that the plan prioritizes the application of artificial intelligence (AI)  in
the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of chronic diseases. The
development and implementation of AI -based predictive models can significantly
enhance diagnostic accuracy, leading to more effective treatment strategies, which
in turn will reduce mortality and improve patients’ quality of life. Additionally, AI’s
role in precision medicine  can optimize treatment plans tailored to individual
patients based on their unique health data.
3.Ethical AI Governance and Access to Open Health Data
Finally, I suggest the inclusion of clear guidelines on ethical AI governance  in
healthcare, particularly related to data privacy and security. It is crucial to create


2 regulatory frameworks that ensure the ethical use of open health data while 
protecting patient privacy. This will foster trust in AI applications in healthcare and 
enhance collaboration across the public and private sectors.  
I believe that these proposals will not only advance the use of AI in healthcare but also 
contribute to a robust and responsible AI ecosystem in the United States. Thank you for the 
opportunity to provide feedback. I look forward to seeing how these ideas are incorporated 
into the final AI Action Plan.  
Sincerely,
