General Comment
While I agree that AI could have incredible use in m any applications, to allow AI to steal data and m aterial, the proper word for “training”
AI on m aterial of which the creators do not consent, is nothing short of a violation against hum an rights to intellectual property and an
affront to civilized and decent ownership handlings. Not only will the vast m ajority of this only create a sea of digital garbage that will
im pact our real-world clim ate, it will threaten the careers and financial lives of so m any people in creative fields. All this, and for what will
ultim ately becom e an uninspired novelty, dam pening hum an output and lessening the arts, which nations used to pride them selves on, to
slop.
