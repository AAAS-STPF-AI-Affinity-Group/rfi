Greetings,
I have sent you this email in protest against the usage of AI. I do not believe AI holds a place
in the future of the US. It steals from my livelihood as an American and profits off of theft. Ifyou or any of your associates believe that a person's work should be protected. Then pleasereconsider.
Thank you,Darryl Hardy Jr
