General Comment
against Executive Order 14179
Creatives went into their fields with an agreem ent from  the governm ent in place; their work will belong to them  until they sold the rights to
their labor to specific parties and under specific arrangem ents that they are able to refuse. It's the basic prem ise of labor. Copyright exists
to incentivize creatives to create, its base purpose is to ensure we are not com peting with our own work in the m arketplace. Generative
AI uses our work to com pete with us directly.
