General Comment
I disagree with the idea of letting AI com panies have access to copy written works, and I do not think that AI is a reliable or secure path
forward. I also do not think the environm ental im pact is worth the price, and not enough research has been done on possible externalities.
Please do not sacrifice Am erican's creativities or livelihoods to what is at best, a fad, and at worst, a dangerous and unaccountable arbiter
of truth.
