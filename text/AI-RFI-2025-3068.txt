General Comment
This plan is an active threat to all artists and creators out there. AI can only steal ideas from  vulnerable creators and studios and having it
go unchecked will result in m ass plagiarism  as AI scalps people's hard work, costing m ore m oney and resources to m ake than hiring a
hum an creator would, all for a unpassable final product that no one will like. Hum ans want art m ade by hum ans, and AI cannot provide
that ever no m atter how it it is trained. It is dangerous, it should not be used, and should be forbidden tech in private or public use.
