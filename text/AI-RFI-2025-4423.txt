AI is soulless an d genuinely so money hungry its not even sad. I'm wholly against this, as its a violation of al l artists before an d after 
our time. Not only that, but AI is so ungodly dog&^% at everyth ing and th eonly way compan ies can justify it is becau se they 
THINK its good.  Go ahead. Drop the copyri ght bomb and watch as AI is used for some genuinel yhorribl e s&^% against both 
compan ies and individuals.
