General Comment
Generative AI in it's current form  has severe downsides as it stands; the m ost egregious of which being that it steals from  the livelihoods of
thousands of Am ericans for little to no gain for the end user. While it m ay have it's place in certain applications that would be genuinely
hazardous to hum an life, this recent push from  the developers of this technology is being perpetrated by bad actors who are seeking to
bleed our people dry of our quickly dwindling resources financially.
Ask any person within a creative, legal, or custom er service field and they will likely echo these sentim ents as well.
