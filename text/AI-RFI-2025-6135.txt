General Comment
Having ai as a tool can be great but when ai is in charge with out hum an overseeing it leads to death. 
Thats a really dram atic statem ent but its the truth. When a person looses their job to ai and cant provide a lively hood and cant find
som ethong else to do? They die.
When ai is in charge of accepting or declining m edical proceduces with a chance of it having a flawed biasis? 
People die.
And when people die . Other people get angry and the whole thing becom es chaos. 
To m ake it easier stick with having ai as it was m ent to be. A tool not a person.
