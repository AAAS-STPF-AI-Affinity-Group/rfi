A "plan of action" to ensure U.S. leadership and superiority in AI should include the following 
three points, among others: 1. Rescind the 15% indirect cost rate limit enacted by NIH on 
2/7/2025 (and being considered by other funding agencies, such as NSF) . This cut will cause 
universities to not even apply for government grants anymore, and is already encouraging private 
sponsors to request the same unworkable reduction. This will achieve the opposite of the 
government's goal by triggering a collapse of re search efforts and a "brain drain" of AI 
researchers to China and Europe. While the indirect cost rates charged by some institutions may 
seem excessive, new rates could be negotiated based on audited facts about administrative and 
support costs, not on suc h an arbitrary low limit. 2. Identify and retain (or rehire) government 
employees whose job is related to leveraging AI in their various departments and agencies, for 
example (but not limited to) the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), where AI  is 
used to detect and counter cyberthreats against critical national resources. Probationary 
government employees, who are currently being fired en masse, are often precisely the younger 
ones who have greater expertise in AI. "AI literacy" needs to be tak en into account when making 
personnel decisions. 3. Abandon the political posturing: by including in the text of this RFI an 
unnecessary attack against the actions of the previous administration, you are probably 
discouraging a number of important actors f rom contributing to the desired plan of action.
