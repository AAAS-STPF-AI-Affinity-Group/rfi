General Comment
Generative AI is little m ore than a m achine that takes work from  artists, m ushes it up, and then replicates it in no m eaningful way. This
work lacks soul and the ability speak to the hum an condition.
Not only this, but it will be used to take jobs from  artists. Consum ing copywritten work to create a m achine that replicates it to the ends of
pushing artists out of industry is unethical and fom enting a disaster.
OpenAI should have to pay all creators of works used in their m odels and further pay royalties for everything generated since AI cannot
create anything if its own volition but only reductive replications therein.
