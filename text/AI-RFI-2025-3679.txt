General Comment
Don't do this. AI isn't a boogeym an com ing for everyone, but that's because we have regulations in place to protect our privacy. If this
goes through, copyright standards weaken across the board. Their product adds nothing of value to the world and instead takes, takes,
and takes to m ake som ething that's infinitely worse than the pieces it's com posed of. Please no.
