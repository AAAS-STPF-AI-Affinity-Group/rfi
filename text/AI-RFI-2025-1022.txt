General Comment
The field of AI is being gate-kept by com puter scientists who think because they program m ed the tool or have a deep understanding of
algorithm s and com puter science, they deserve to be the only ones in the field.
Dem and AI be governed by m akers and users, coders and custodians, innovators and ethicists - or watch dem ocracy itself becom e
another algorithm  to be hacked.
Did those who landed on Norm andy work in the factory m aking the guns?
The Wright Brothers engineered flight, but pilots, regulators, and passengers shaped its evolution.
Henry Ford m ass-produced cars, but society-built highways, safety laws, and public transit
Break the status quo when hiring AI USERS - not PROGRAMMERS.
The AI revolution is being hijacked by a cabal of elites and code-obsessed engineers who think their GitHub com m its give them  divine
right to dictate hum anity's future. Meanwhile, China's 100+ AI Innovation Zones - run by farm ers, factory bosses, and party hacks - are
eating our lunch with brute-force experim entation, while Am erica's tim id tech elite cling to their share h algorithm s like sacred texts.
To conservatives: These Silicon Valley "experts" are squandering Am erican dom inance. They'd rather virtue-signal about "ethical AI" in
air-conditioned conferences than unleash the entrepreneurs, m echanics, and soldiers who could weaponize AI to outpace China's ruthless
hustle. Beijing doesn't ask PhDs for perm ission to test facial recognition on 1 billion people - they act. We're too busy gatekeeping job
listings with "Python proficiency" to let a Midwest factory forem an reim agine AI-driven m anufacturing.
To progressives: Wake up! By letting Silicon Valley com puter scientists m onopolize AI developm ent, we're replicating the sam e
exclusionary system s we claim  to hate. China's innovation zones - for all their dystopian risks - at least include street vendors, m iners, and
state hacks in their AI experim ents. Meanwhile, our "inclusive" tech class shuts out teachers, nurses, and union reps from  shaping AI tools
that will autom ate their jobs. If only the privileged get to code the future, whose biases get hardwired?
Here's the truth: China's AI isn't better - it's hungrier. They'll let a Shenzhen sweatshop boss plug ChatGPT into a drone assem bly line
tom orrow, no ethics or institutional review board required. Am erica? We've got Ivy League grads writing 10-page fairness m anifestos
while China gobbles rare earth m inerals drag and dropping patents. We're losing because our "experts" value technical purity over real-
world grit.
Break the cult of credentials. Let the red-state farm er use AI to repair his own Tractor. Let the Bronx teacher use ChatGPT to help teach.
Let veterans do what they want with it; they served our country. If we don't dem ocratize AI hiring- fast - we'll be ruled by two tyrannies.
China's ruthless pragm atism  and our own arrogant technocracy. The stakes? freedom  itself.
This is not a partisan issue - it's a war for the soul of the next generation, waged by algorithm s weaponized to addict, radicalize, and
com m odify our children. Corporations like Meta - shielded by arm ies of lobbyists - prioritize profit over hum an dignity, turning screens
into digital opium  while dodging accountability with perform ative outrage. They exploit your child's m ind, harvesting data and attention


spans, yet dem and we treat them  as "innovators," not predators.
Meanwhile, authoritarian regim es like China enforce draconian safeguards - one hour of gam ing weekly for m inors - because even
dictators recognize unchecked tech erodes societal control. Yet in Am erica, bipartisan cowardice lets CEOs plunder our children's
futures. Conservatives tolerate it, dism issing 18+ for Instagram  as "governm ent overreach," while progressives cower, fearing criticism  of...
losing m oney. This dystopia where kids are lab rats for Silicon Valley's greed.
This is cultural suicide. If we fail to act, the next generation won't just speak Mandarin in classroom s - they'll inherit a world where their
thoughts, relationships, and freedom s are auctioned to the highest bidder. Parents lose. Did you know if Tik Tok's algorithm  sees a young
Am erican looking at content to enlist in the m ilitary, they will start seeing videos on doing drugs and be recom m ended to follow drug
dealers. How is this allowed on our soil?
Where is the outrage? The left won't adm it that "innovation" has becom e exploitation. The right won't confront corporations shredding
fam ily values for profit. Politicians protect donors, not kids. Your grandchild's future? Sold for stock surges and shareholder sm iles as they
are taught elem entary school in Chinese.
This isn't about red or blue - it's about hum an dignity versus algorithm ic tyranny. If we value freedom , fam ily, or a functioning society, we'll
tear down this norm alized exploitation.
"Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei,
Led us to this perfect day.
Marx, Wood, Wei and Christ,
All but Wei were sacrificed."
