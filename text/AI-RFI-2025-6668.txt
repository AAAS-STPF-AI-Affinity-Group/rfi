General Comment
This is not som ething I wish to see fulfilled. I believe a.i. CAN have a place in Am erica's future, but not by taking from  others hard work.
Should it be able to replicate what say an artist can do, a m usic creator, a receptionist, what are they to do? A m achine does not need
pay, but this country requires people to WORK to LIVE. 
I do not want to see people have their jobs, hom es, taken by this.
For som e things a.i. can be am azing. NOT, all things.
