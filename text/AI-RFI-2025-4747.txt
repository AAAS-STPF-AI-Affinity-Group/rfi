General Comment
Big corporations have absolutely no right to steal the work and jobs of hum an artists, in order to fuel their fakery and plagiarism  m achines.
They should have to pay for their data, and the artists that agree should get paid well. There m ust be protections for individual liberties
including being able to pursue a living in the arts.
