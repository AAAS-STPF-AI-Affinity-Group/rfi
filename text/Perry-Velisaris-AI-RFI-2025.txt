Perry Velisaris, 
My name is P erry Velisaris and I am a 2nd semester senior at Avonworth High School. I 
studied ge nerative AI and its impact on Physical Therapy for two months in a course on AI 
and Ethics this year. From my research, I think this current administration's viewpoint on AI 
regulation is going up. They say that “excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a 
transformative industry just as it’s taking off and we make every effort to encourage pro -
growth AI policies” The government is not trying to stop AI from growing at all, they are 
actually promoting AI in businesses, and for other countries to use American AI. In the Physical Therapy ﬁeld, the devices that help with screenings, and patients that can’t make it into clinics like the devices FOTO(Focus On Therapeutic Outcomes), and SWORD are just 
two devices that will help change how Physical Therapy is done for the better. FOTO is a 
machine that does patient analysis screens to help the PTs see what's wrong with the patients’ bodies. Before this was made, it would be hard for PTs to make precise calls on what was wrong because they couldn’t actually see inside the body. SWORD is a device that patients use at home which helps with them not being able to make it into the clinic for 
whatever reason that is. What this does is has a PT make a program for the patient to do at 
home. It records the patient and gives feedback when a patient is doing it wrong. It can also change a workout depending on how the patient is feeling.
