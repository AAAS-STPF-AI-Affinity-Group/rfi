General Comment
AI is not above the law. No one and no technology is above the law. Copyright or otherwise this would set a chilling precedent.
We cannot allow this to happen. It will erode protections of all kinds as well as hum anity itself. What we donâ€™t use, we lose. Problem
solving and creative thinking included.
Do you really want AI to becom e so prevalent that m edical students can use it? That law students can? To pass their exam s?
This is a step in that direction. We m ust protect ourselves in all ways. Copyright protections m ust be upheld!
