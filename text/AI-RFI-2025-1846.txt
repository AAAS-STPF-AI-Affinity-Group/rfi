General Comment
Rem oving the guardrails of AI will only serve to ruin the lives and businesses of artists, authors, and professionals all over this country, by
"learning from " or rather STEALING content. Additionally, generative AI of all kinds (whether it be Deepseek or OpenAI) is extrem ely
detrim ental to the environm ent, and unleashing its reigns will only allow it to further increase the im pact of clim ate change, which in turn
leads to m ore natural disasters that cost m illions of lives and m oney. The focus on AI should be to use it to advance m edical developm ents
and other services that IMPROVE the lives of Am ericans. Allowing AI to reign free without restrictions is a terrible idea and will not lead
the US to becom ing an "AI Powerhouse", but will instead only m arch us closer to the dystopian fascist em pire that we've been headed
toward the past few m onths (years, really). If the Trum p adm inistration really wanted to do whats best for Am ericans, passing through this
plan is not it.
