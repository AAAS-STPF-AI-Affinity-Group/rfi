My name is Julianne Knable and I am a graduating senior from Avonworth High School. I 
researched the impact of generative AI on cybersecurity for a semester course, and recently 
studied this administration's viewpoint on AI regulation. Based on my two mont hs of student 
research, I think that regulation of AI is necessary as it grows within America and around the 
world. There is a constant need for security measures to protect the country as more AI is 
involved, without replacing humans. AI in cybersecurity has created new possibilities to easily 
detect and prevent threats. However as AI continues to grow and strengthen, the potential loss of 
security and privacy does too. Communities have already grown for the better with the help of 
AI and advancements in t echnology but in order to stay a healthy community, not all forms of AI 
should be available to everyone. As cybersecurity works with the growing workings of 
technology, there will be a stronger need for a balance between technology and human resources.
