General Comment
As a working artist, I am  appalled and outraged at this blanket protection from  copyright enforcem ent being offered to the developm ent of
so-called "AI." These program s are in no way intelligent and yet are being used to justify the elim ination of jobs and opportunities for
artists of all types, decim ating the livelihoods of actual hum an creators. I object to this proposal in the strongest possible term s.
