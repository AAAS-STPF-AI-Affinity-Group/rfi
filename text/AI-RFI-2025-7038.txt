General Comment
The use of Artificial intelligence shouldn't be pushed as this. We already have issues as people of AI com panies breaking the law through
thieft of individual copyright holders on all scales. Every aspect of arts has been ripped through scraping of data to be used unlawfully and
unwillingly. Pushing forward a law such a this will not only encourage m ore theft of the m ass scale, but gives im m unity to those com panies
who are stealing from  people.
As well, the use of Generative AI has no place in the governm ent, let alone public use. It's convincing enough to m ake others see fake
videos seem  real and can easily be used to falsify evidence. With other form s of AI being m isused to point guilty at innocent people and be
a security risk as com panies will sell out secrets to the highest bidder. It's already been shown with Health Issuance com panies using AI, a
large am ount of people getting denied helped and m edical treatm ent they need because "The algorithm " doesn't want them  to get it.
Currently as we stand in 2025, there is no place for AI. Not in it's current state, not with the data it steals, not with it's current developers.
and letting it in with the law will only m ake life worse for a lot of people.
