Introduction 
We strongly support the Administration's effort to define priority policy actions needed to sustain 
and enhance America's AI dominance. In this submission, we outline a highly promising 
computer chip security mechanism called a Flexible Hardware-Enabled Guarantee 
(FlexHEG) , which could solve critical security challenges while cementing American leadership 
in AI development. 
 
Recent advances in AI capabilities suggest that even more powerful systems will emerge over 
the coming years. The Administration faces dual challenges: accelerating American innovation 
while ensuring that powerful AI technologies are not used by foreign adversaries to threaten US 
national security interests. A hardware-based approach that provides verifiable security measures 
while allowing unfettered domestic innovation would address both challenges simultaneously. 
 
FlexHEG technology is thus ideal for advancing American interests: a security system that 
would be integrated into AI chips, combining a tamper-proof enclosure with a secure processor 
to enable trustworthy, privacy-preserving verification and enforcement of claims about how 
those chips are used. This technology would allow the US to extend its technological leadership 
while enforcing accountable development practices. 
 
What Are FlexHEGs? 
 
FlexHEG systems combine two key components: 1. Secure processor: This component measures the AI chip's operations and can enforce 
security policies or verify claims about chip usage. Unlike typical cybersecurity 
approaches, the secure processor provides hardware-level verification that cannot be 
circumvented by software manipulation. 
2. Tamper-proof enclosure: This physical protection prevents unauthorized access to the 
hardware, ensuring that security measures cannot be bypassed through physical 
modifications. If tampering is detected, the system can trigger countermeasures ranging 
from simple alerts to complete self-disablement. 
 
These components work together to create a technical foundation for verifiable claims about chip 
usage while maintaining privacy. Most importantly, FlexHEGs would be designed to be fully 
open-source and auditable, making it suitable for deployment in contexts where trust is 
limited—such as export-controlled chips sent to lower trust jurisdictions or security-critical 
applications. 
2 


The secure processor would operate like a black box recorder for AI systems—monitoring what 
happens without unnecessarily restricting operations for legitimate users. For exports or high-risk 
deployments, additional restrictions could be configured as needed. 
Early prototypes of FlexHEGs have already been demonstrated. Initial scoping work has begun, 
supported by philanthropic funding. An interim report has been prepared1, and an updated 
comprehensive report will be available to the Administration shortly. 
Enhancing American National Security 
Preventing Theft and Unauthorized Access to AI Systems 
The theft of American intellectual property and AI model weights represents an increasingly 
serious threat to our technological advantage. Losses of IP aren't just economic—they erode 
America's technological edge by providing adversaries immediate access to capabilities that may 
have required billions in R&D investment to create. 
FlexHEGs would introduce strong hardware-based protections that go beyond software security 
measures: ●Tamper-responsive enclosure: Advanced physical protection of chips, with sensors to
detect tampering attempts and trigger deletion of data before it can be exfiltrated.
●Model weight encryption: In-line encryption to protect all data that leaves the secure
enclosure.
These protections would prove particularly valuable for advanced AI models that represent the 
product of computational resources strategically denied to adversarial nations through export 
controls. A single theft of a frontier AI model could significantly undermine US strategic 
advantage by providing adversaries immediate access to refined intellectual property derived 
from restricted computational resources. 
Securing Exports While Expanding Markets 
A key advantage of FlexHEGs is their ability to maintain security controls even after AI chips 
have been shipped to lower trust jurisdictions. Without hardware-based security measures, the 
Administration faces a stark choice: either restrict exports of advanced AI chips (severely 
limiting market access for American chip manufacturers) or accept significant security risks.

● Controlled deployment in lower trust environments: American AI models could be 
deployed internationally, with FlexHEGs providing an additional layer of security on top 
of conventional defenses for protecting model weights  
● Verification of operating restrictions: Exports could be configured to only permit 
approved uses, with hardware-level verification 
● Remote disablement: Configuration options could allow US authorities to remotely 
disable chips if they are diverted to unauthorized uses or locations 
 
This approach mirrors successful precedents such as Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) which 
enable systems to operate securely in adversarial environments, and Hardware Security Modules 
(HSM) which are used by the American cryptography industry to protect sensitive operations. 
 
Bolstering American Technology Leadership 
 
Maintaining Compute Advantage Through Hardware Security 
Computational capacity represents a crucial advantage for American AI development, in 
particular the development of the most advanced frontier AI models. Unlike data or algorithms, 
compute is a relatively controllable resource, making it an effective point of leverage for national 
technology policy. Current export controls aim to preserve America’s current advantage by 
denying adversaries access to advanced AI chips, but this approach faces growing challenges 
from smuggling and the development of alternative chips. 
FlexHEGs provide a more effective approach to maintaining compute advantage: ● Verification of chip usage: Hardware-level monitoring of how chips are being utilized 
could ensure compliance with export restrictions 
● Prevention of cluster aggregation: FlexHEGs could prevent unauthorized clustering of 
chips into larger systems capable of training the most advanced models 
● Quantitative limits: Systems could be configured to enforce specific compute 
thresholds, preventing training runs above certain sizes 
 
By creating technical constraints on compute aggregation that are enforceable through hardware, 
FlexHEGs could grant foreign users sufficient compute access for legitimate commercial 
applications while preventing foreign adversaries from assembling the large compute clusters 
required for training frontier AI models. 
 
Developing Technical Standards 
Hardware security standards are particularly effective when they originate from a position of 
market dominance. By developing and implementing FlexHEGs, the US would establish de facto 
technical standards that favor American interests.

This approach has several advantages: 
●First-mover benefit: Early establishment of standards tends to create path dependency in
subsequent technology development
●Market leverage : American companies' dominant position in AI chips provides
significant leverage for standard-setting
●Technical control points: Hardware-based standards create lasting control points that are
difficult for competitors to circumvent
The Administration should encourage American companies to develop common standards for 
hardware security in AI chips, potentially using NIST as a coordinating body. These standards 
could then be incorporated into export control requirements, creating strong incentives for 
adoption. 
Enabling Trusted AI Development Without Sacrificing Innovation 
Recent proposals for AI safety have raised concerns about their potential to hamper American 
innovation through excessive reporting requirements or restrictions. FlexHEG offers an 
alternative approach: verifiable security and safety claims without unnecessary disclosure or 
restriction. 
For example, rather than requiring companies to publicly disclose training details that might 
compromise their competitive advantage, FlexHEGs would enable them to make verifiable 
safety claims without revealing proprietary information. 
This approach aligns with the Administration's goals of removing unnecessary barriers to 
American leadership in AI while ensuring appropriate safety measures are in place. 
Immediate Security Gains Through Existing Hardware 
While comprehensive FlexHEG systems represent the future of AI hardware security, significant 
security enhancements are achievable in the near term through firmware updates to existing AI 
chips combined with software-based approaches. Current hardware already contains security 
features that could be leveraged immediately to address pressing national security concerns: 
●Ping-based geolocation: Firmware updates could enable verification that chips remain in
authorized jurisdictions
●Offline licensing enforcement: Automatic disabling of chips detected outside their
authorized locations
5 


● Enhanced model protection: Strengthened security measures to prevent theft of 
valuable AI models 
● Verifiable evaluations: Privacy-preserving verification of AI model capabilities and 
properties 
 
Manufacturers like NVIDIA could likely develop and deploy these capabilities to existing H100s 
and other advanced AI chips in a matter of months, through a combination of firmware updates 
and software-based approaches. The Administration could encourage or incentivize this course 
of action through various means. These capabilities would build upon existing hardware security, 
which would be challenging for adversaries to circumvent, providing immediate security benefits 
while more comprehensive FlexHEG systems are being developed. 
 
It would be a mistake for the Administration to wait until FlexHEG technology was fully 
developed before pursuing increased hardware security. The full FlexHEG system will extend 
these capabilities, introducing purpose-built hardware with both greater security against 
expensive state-level attacks and the flexibility to address evolving governance requirements.  
 
Implementation Roadmap 
 
We recommend the Administration pursue a phased approach to developing and implementing 
FlexHEG technology. This approach acknowledges both the urgency of addressing AI security 
challenges and the technical complexity involved in developing robust hardware solutions. 
 
Phase 1: Initial R&D and Pilot Deployments (2025-2026) 
The Administration should immediately initiate research into secure processors and tamper-proof 
enclosures tailored for AI chips. Early versions could focus on verification capabilities, with 
enforcement mechanisms to be added in later iterations. 
Actions should include: ● DARPA research program: Launch a dedicated program for developing FlexHEG 
technology, including tamper-responsive enclosures, auditable processor IP blocks, and 
algorithms to automatically check for rules 
● NIST standards development: Direct NIST to develop preliminary standards for 
hardware security in AI chips 
● Pilot deployments: Fund initial deployments in national security applications 
● Industry engagement: Establish a working group with leading AI chip manufacturers to 
ensure compatibility with commercial technology roadmaps 
 
6 


These initial efforts would focus on establishing technical feasibility and creating reference 
implementations that could be refined in subsequent phases. 
 
Phase 2: Commercial Integration and Export Applications (2026-2027) 
Building on the results of Phase 1, the Administration should focus on integrating FlexHEG 
technology into commercial AI chips and applying it to secure exports of advanced computing 
technology. 
Actions should include: 
● Export control integration: Modify export control requirements to favor 
FlexHEG-equipped chips 
● Commercial incentives: Provide expedited planning approval with faster security 
auditing for FlexHEG-equipped systems 
● Retrofitting program: Develop capabilities for adding FlexHEG protections to existing 
chips, allowing rapid implementation 
 
By the end of Phase 2, FlexHEG technology should be sufficiently mature for deployment in 
export-controlled contexts, allowing more flexible export policies while maintaining security. 
 
Phase 3: Widespread Adoption and Sophisticated Applications (2027-2028) 
In the final phase, the Administration should focus on driving widespread adoption of FlexHEG 
technology and leveraging it for increasingly sophisticated security applications. 
Actions should include: 
● Regulatory requirements: Institute requirements for FlexHEG verification in high-risk 
AI applications 
● Advanced security features: Develop more sophisticated security features based on 
lessons from earlier deployments 
● Integration with AI safety frameworks: Connect hardware verification to broader AI 
safety initiatives 
● Enforcement infrastructure: Establish the necessary infrastructure for monitoring 
compliance and responding to violations 
 
By this phase, FlexHEGs should become a standard feature of advanced AI chips, providing 
robust security for American AI technology regardless of where it is deployed. 
 
Recommended Policy Actions 
 
To advance this technology and its strategic benefits, we recommend the following policy actions 
for inclusion in the AI Action Plan: 
7 


1. Establish a National Security Presidential Memorandum on AI Hardware
Security
The President should issue a National Security Presidential Memorandum directing relevant
agencies to prioritize the development and deployment of hardware security measures for AI
chips. This memorandum should:
●Instruct the Department of Commerce to develop export control provisions favoring
FlexHEG-equipped hardware
●Direct the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community to develop capabilities for
evaluating hardware security in AI systems
●Establish a cross-agency task force to coordinate FlexHEG development and deployment
●Direct NIST to develop technical standards for secure AI hardware
A Presidential directive would create the necessary sense of urgency and ensure coordinated 
action across relevant agencies. 
2. Direct Implementation of Near-Term Hardware Security Measures
The Administration should immediately direct the implementation of firmware- and
software-based security measures for existing AI chips:
●Partner with private chip manufacturers to develop and deploy firmware and software
updates that enable basic security features on existing hardware, using federal
procurement leverage and voluntary industry collaboration
●Establish a fast-track working group between the Department of Commerce, NIST, and
leading chip manufacturers to define technical requirements for these updates
●Create incentives for voluntary adoption by domestic users while requiring
implementation for exported hardware
●Consider invoking the Defense Production Act if absolutely necessary in order to
accelerate implementation
These near-term measures would provide immediate national security benefits while more 
comprehensive FlexHEG systems are being developed, creating a bridge between current 
vulnerabilities and the robust security infrastructure outlined in this proposal. 
3. Fund a Major DARPA Research Program
The Administration should direct DARPA to establish a major research program focused on
developing secure processor technology and tamper-proof enclosures for AI chips. This program
should receive initial funding of at least $100 million and focus on:
8 


● Open-source secure processor designs optimized for AI applications 
● Advanced tamper-detection and response mechanisms 
● Algorithms for automatically checking whether chip usage is compliant 
● Methods for retrofitting security to existing hardware 
 
DARPA's experience with high-risk, high-reward research makes it ideally suited to drive the 
initial development of FlexHEG technology. 
 
4. Create Export Control Incentives 
The Department of Commerce should modify export control regulations to provide streamlined 
approval processes for FlexHEG-equipped AI chips. These modifications should: 
● Establish a technical certification process for FlexHEG compliance 
● Create expedited approval pathways for certified systems 
● Allow broader deployment of certified systems to Tier 2 countries under the Framework 
for AI Diffusion 
● Develop mechanisms for verifying ongoing compliance through hardware attestation 
 
These incentives would drive commercial adoption while advancing national security objectives. 
 
5. Establish Procurement Preferences 
The Administration should direct federal agencies to establish procurement preferences for AI 
systems equipped with FlexHEG technology. This would: 
● Create immediate market demand for FlexHEG-equipped systems 
● Provide real-world testing and refinement opportunities 
● Demonstrate federal commitment to the technology 
● Improve security for government AI deployments 
 
Federal procurement represents a powerful tool for driving technology adoption and should be 
leveraged to accelerate FlexHEG deployment. 
 
6. Direct NIST to Develop Technical Standards 
NIST should be directed to develop comprehensive technical standards for hardware security in 
AI chips, including: 
● Reference designs for secure processors 
● Testing and certification protocols 
● Attestation formats and procedures 
● Requirements for tamper-evident and tamper-responsive features 
9 


 
These standards would provide a foundation for industry implementation and regulatory 
requirements. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The continued advancement of AI capabilities presents both enormous opportunities and 
significant challenges for American leadership. By developing and deploying FlexHEG 
technology, the Administration can address critical security concerns while promoting continued 
innovation. This approach offers several key advantages: 
● It maintains American technological leadership by securing AI technology against theft 
and misuse 
● It enables more flexible export policies by providing hardware-level security for chips 
deployed internationally 
● It creates a technical foundation for addressing emerging security threats posed by 
advanced AI capabilities 
● It establishes American dominance in the critical domain of AI hardware security 
 
The window of opportunity to establish technical standards in this domain may be relatively 
brief. As AI capabilities continue to advance and foreign competitors develop alternative chip 
technologies, the ability to implement effective hardware security measures may become more 
limited. By acting decisively now, the Administration can secure lasting advantages for 
American AI technology. 
 
The development of FlexHEGs does not require fundamental scientific breakthroughs—all the 
necessary technologies exist today in various forms. What's needed is focused development, 
integration, and deployment, driven by clear policy directives and adequate resources. By 
including FlexHEG development in the AI Action Plan, the Administration would take a 
significant step toward ensuring continued American dominance in AI.
