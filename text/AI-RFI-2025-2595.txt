General Comment
I do not want large language m odels or artificial general intelligence being developed any further, I have concerns about the way
copyrighted m aterial and the works by independent writers, artists and journalists becom e folded into these m achine system s to serve as
m aterial which becom es used by larger agencies, businesses, corporations and organizations for their profit. Additionally, I believe these
technologies take away the m ost im portant thing from  ourselves: our hum an desire to create. I do not support this technology and I would
like to see it cease developm ent.
