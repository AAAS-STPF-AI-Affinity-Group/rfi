This is a clear quid pro quo for a billionaire donor, Sam Altman. Corrupt on the face of it, illegal on the face of it:  
you cannot give away rights to intellectual property that is not yours. The result will continue the environmental  
harms of the current AI bubble while continuing to flood the internet with deceptive AI slop.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
