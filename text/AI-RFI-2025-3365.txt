General Comment
As an Am erican artist with m any artistic peers I oppose this as it would directly effect the livelyhoods of so m any individuals, including m y
own. AI is already profiting off of theft and this action will just boost those capabilities. AI holds no place in the furtue of the US and will
take m oney from  hardworking Am ericans.
