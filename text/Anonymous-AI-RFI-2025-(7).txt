No advancement in AI is worth stealing the work of the creative class so others can make profits 
off of them. Millions of creative people deserve to get remunerated for their work. It isn't ethical 
to use the work of others without their permission, any more than it's ethical to steal the blueprints of Tesla and start manufacturing them on one's own. If they want to create AI, they should supply their own generating material, not use mine. I work hard to do what I do, and this order just lets them take whatever they want without asking. It's not fair, and it's not ethical. It's not moral. Please do not enact this order. No amount of profit for oligarchs is worth the 
livelihood I've strived to achieve.
