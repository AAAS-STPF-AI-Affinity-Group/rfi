General Comment
I hope the AI action plan never sees the light of day. As it stands, AI is a tool for the greedy to either m ooch off people's work or lazily
breeze through what should be decisions saftly m ade with hum an input. Rem oving the barriers set inplace is troubling and that fact alone
speaks to how this we'll see the plan pan out if it ever were to com e to fruition.
