General Comment
This is a horrible idea and will do im m ense dam age to the future of the Am erican public. Why should anyone be im m une from  copyright
infringem ent. This is putting the perceived needs of corporations above the needs of all the Am erican public. We need to protect the
intellectual property and creativity of the citizens not underm ine it.
