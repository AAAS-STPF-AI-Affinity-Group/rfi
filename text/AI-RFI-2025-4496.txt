General Comment
Generative AI should not be allowed to train on any art im ages, literature, or data without the explicit consent of the content creator. 
Tools like these (OpenAI) only serve to steal from  and further im poverish Am ericans -especially sm all business creatives, like freelance
writers posting sam ples for work, or illustrators who need to upload work in order to secure art com m issions- when m easures aren't
taken to ensure people can opt out of having their work be part of the trainable data.
Just because art, m usic, and video can be found on the internet does not m ake it free to take and fair gam e for com m ercial use. Especially
so for a com m ercial Generative AI com pany that will not pay the m illions of creatives who provide the content the tool trains on while
pocketing m oney. Mechanism s should be in place for opting out BEFORE any training begins.
Or even better: pay the people m aking the content you want to train these tools on before training begins. Creatives are hard working
Am ericans, too, and deserve paym ent.
Gen AI innovation doesn't have to and should not rely on theft.
