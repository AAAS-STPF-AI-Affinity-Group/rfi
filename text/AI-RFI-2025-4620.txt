General Comment
Open AI represents a direct threat to m y career as a writer. Copyright protection is enshrined law - it exists for a reason. AI and other
LLM’s claim ing they deserve the right to scrape m y work for free is sim ply a solution in search of a problem . It will bankrupt the m any to
enrich the few. It’s yet another internet bubble - like NFT’s. It’s pure profit-seeking and should be illegal.
