AI is absolutely terrible, inaccurate, and a threat to all human creativity. Giving Big Tech a
blank check to steal the work of literally everyone to use up massive energy resources only toend up with a flawed, inaccurate product is insanity. No one wants AI, no one voluntarily usesit, it is just thrust on us by a tech industry that has invested far too much money into a productthat is NEVER going to be the utopian tool that they promised. Now, their last hail-mary is toconvince the US government to invest in this money sink-hole at the expense of every singlehuman being on earth. This is a GRIFT. Do not fall for it.
