1 1.Deﬁne the Role of AI in Society
AI should be developed to assist humanity across a wide range of applications, with the primary goal of
enhancing human capabilities and decision-making. While AI can automate routine tasks where errors
do not signiﬁcantly harm humans—such as approving transportation permits—it must not replace
human judgment in decisions that could substantially aƯect people’s lives, such as legal sentencing or
denying healthcare. The focus is to ensure AI remains a tool under human control, supporting rather than
supplanting human agency.
2.Establish Robust Ethical Safeguards
To keep AI aligned with human control and responsibility:
Broad Human Oversight : Require human approval for any AI-driven decisions that could
signiﬁcantly aƯect individuals’ lives, even if not classiﬁed as high-stakes by traditional metrics, to
prevent harm from automated processes.
American Values : Build AI systems reﬂecting liberty, justice, and fairness, consistent with
national principles.
No Independent AI Control : Prohibit AI from autonomously managing systems where errors
could potentially cause serious harm without human authorization.
These standards will be enforced by federal law. 
3.Ensure Transparency and Accountability
AI systems impacting Americans must be:
Explainable : Capable of providing clear, understandable reasons for their actions.
Auditable : Subject to regular checks by independent federal agencies to ensure compliance.
Accountable : Developers and operators must be legally liable for harm caused by AI.
This builds public trust and accountability. 
4.Ensure National Security and Sovereignty in AI Development
To safeguard against foreign interference:
All AI systems used in government programs or projects must be developed using computers and
components manufactured in the United States.
These systems must be programmed and maintained exclusively by United States citizens.
This ensures security and national control over critical AI infrastructure. 
5.Create a Dynamic Regulatory Framework
A practical regulatory system will guide AI:


2 Risk-Based Rules : Apply oversight based on the potential for negative impact to United States
Citizens on a sliding scale. E.g. light oversight to low-risk AI (e.g., consumer tools like simple
transportation permits) and stricter rules to higher-risk AI (e.g., weapons, monthly payments to
people, etc.), managed by relevant agencies.
Adaptable Legislation : Establish a Congressional task force to regularly review and update AI
laws, including experts from technology, ethics, and policy to ensure informed adaptability.
This balances innovation and safety. 
6.Guarantee Human Access in AI-Driven Systems
Every AI system must oƯer:
Human Contact : All AI services (e.g., customer support, government help) must oƯer clear
options to speak with a live person by phone, email, and web chat.
Quick Escalation : AI must transfer control to human staƯ promptly when requested by the person
trying to resolve their issue – ensuring people aren’t stuck with automated responses.
This guarantees that Americans can always reach a human, preserving personal control and 
accountability. 
This should not just be for AI but for all government agencies, NGOs or entities that people are required to 
interact with because of government rules or regulations. 
We’ve noticed a trend of it becoming more and more diƯicult to contact a human being (including our 
elected representatives) when we try to redress our grievances. To the extent possible, contacting these 
entities should be as easy as picking up the phone or sending an email.  
7.Prevent Abuse of AI Data Access
To stop misuse of AI data by those in power, strong protections are essential:
Tamper-Proof Logging : Record all access to sensitive AI data on an unchangeable system, like
blockchain, showing who accessed what and when.
Court Approval : Require judicial permission (like the FISA courts) for accessing certain data
deemed personal, sensitive or outside the classiﬁcation of the person wanting the information -
preventing unauthorized use.
Public Oversight : Conduct regular, independent audits of data access, with summary reports
available to the public for transparency.
These steps ensure data is handled responsibly and those with access are accountable. 
8.Invest in Public Education and Engagement
Americans must understand AI to keep it in check:


3 AI Education : Fund programs to teach AI’s uses and limits.
Citizen Input: Hold town halls and online forums to let Americans help shape AI policies.
Developer Training: Require ethics courses in tech education to build a responsible AI workforce.
An informed public ensures AI serves the nation’s interests. 
9.Prioritize AI Safety Research
Research is key to managing AI risks:
Reliability : Fund eƯorts to secure AI against attacks or failures.
Practical Alignment : Support studies on keeping AI aligned with American values over time.
Risk Planning : Establish a federal AI safety institute to study long-term dangers and suggest
solutions.
This prepares the U.S. for AI challenges. 
10.Foster a Culture of Responsibility
Ethical responsibility must guide AI development:
Standards : Require all government agencies, NGOs or other entities that receive tax payer dollars
to follow ethical AI standards.
Whistleblower Support : Protect those who report AI abuses in government or industry.
Global Inﬂuence : Share U.S. guidelines to address global AI issues, led by American principles.
This builds a system where responsibility is the norm.
