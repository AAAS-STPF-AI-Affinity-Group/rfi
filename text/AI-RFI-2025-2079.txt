General Comment
Allowing tech com panies to have access to copyrighted and non copyrighted m aterial without any com pensation or regulation is a recipe
for disaster for this country. Not only would com panies with copyrighted m aterial lose out on profits, creatives would be literally robbed
for their art and ideas. AI being used to help creatives is ok as long as there is regulation. However cutting the creatives out entirely and
those with copyrighted m aterials would fall victim  to greedy corporations and begin to devalue creative arts, film s, m usic and m ore. Art
only has value when a PERSON creates it.
