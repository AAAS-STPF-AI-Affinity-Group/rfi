1 1.Introduction
AI 2030  is a global initiative aiming to harness the transformative power of AI to benefit 
humanity while minimizing its potential negative impact. AI 2030 aims to bridge 
awareness, talent, and resource gaps, enabling trustworthy and safe AI adoption across 
publi c and private sectors.  Currently, AI 2030 has  a thriving community of over 2,000 
members across 18 countries, including more than 80% members from the United 
States. With strong expertise within our network, we have contributed to major 
consultations, including the UN Global D igital Compact, US NIST, and the governments 
of Singapore and Malaysia.  
To provide feedback on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan RFI 
and advance AI for a safe, secure, and prosperous U.S. economy, we have established a 
dedicated task force. This task force is composed of highly experienced professi onals 
with deep AI experience across multiple industries, ensuring a well -rounded and 
impactful approach.

2. Feedback on the AI Action Plan Overall Approach
To sustain AI leadership while driving innovation, security, and economic prosperity, AI
2030 recommends prioritizing several critical focus areas in the AI Action Plan.  First, to
accelerate market creation for next -generation AI research, development, an d adoption,
the AI Action Plan should drive increased federal investment in AI innovation, expand
public -private partnerships, and establish AI testbeds to support industry adoption. In
addition, the plan would benefit from a more explicit articulation of how to balance
regulation with innovation, particularly in setting guardrails that protect consumers
while fostering AI -driven economic growth. A well -defined approach to accountability is
also necessary, ensuring clear roles and responsibilities for AI de velopers, deployers,
and regulators. Furthermore, promoting a fair and competitive AI ecosystem should be
prioritized to prevent market concentration and ensure that small and medium -sized
enterprises (SMEs) have the opportunity to compete and innovate alo ngside larger
industry players.
Another critical area for prioritization is AI supply chain security, including hardware 
dependencies, semiconductor security, and software vulnerabilities. AI 2030 also 
recommends a more comprehensive approach to data collection, usage, and access. 
Issues  such as copyright, data ownership, and equitable data access must be addressed 


2 to ensure that all AI stakeholders, including SMEs, have the resources necessary to 
develop competitive AI solutions. As the amount and variety of AI -generated content 
continues to grow, distinguishing between AI -generated and human -created data is 
becomin g increasingly urgent. Without clear standards, training data quality could 
deteriorate, leading to potential model failures or performance degradation over time.  
Finally, stronger enforcement and monitoring mechanisms are essential to ensure AI 
policies translate into effective practice. Compliance frameworks, auditability, and real -
time monitoring should be incorporated to mitigate potential risks and ensure 
adherence to established guidelines. Addressing these areas will help strengthen the AI 
Action Plan, fostering a competitive, innovative, and trustworthy AI ecosystem that 
supports both economic growth and societal well -being.  
3. Responses to Key RFI Questions
Q1: What are the most critical challenges and risks associated with AI development 
and deployment?  
AI 2030 has identified several key challenges that must be addressed to ensure the 
safe, equitable, and sustainable development of AI. These challenges span training data 
limitations, economic barriers, workforce preparedness, regulatory coherence, and 
ethical concerns. Below, we outline these critical issues alongside recommendations for 
targeted policy action.  
1.1 Training Data Scarcity and Bias  
A major challenge in AI development is the growing scarcity of high -quality training 
data. Large language models (LLMs) follow a two -step training process: an initial 
baseline training phase, which relies on vast datasets, followed by a post -training phase , 
which uses high -quality labeled data. As an example, the GPT -2 model was trained on 8 
million documents scraped from websites, such as Reddit, social media platforms, and 
newspapers for a total of 40GB of text1. However, experts, including Ilya Sutskever2, have 
warned that publicly available data suitable for baseline training is rapidly depleting .  
As a result, AI developers are exploring synthetic data generation, but current 
techniques lack the quality and diversity required to maintain robust, unbiased AI 
systems. In an experiment, one of our experts used GPT -4 to generate synthetic data for 
a rec ommendation system by generating profiles for users. The system generated data, 
but 100% of the names were anglicised and the male -female ratio was 70 -30. By 
updating the instructions, they were able to generate a less biased dataset that 
included names fr om different nationalities.  
Additionally, training data across specialized fields and languages remains non -
representative of the full diversity of human society, leading to performance disparities 
in AI models. Machine learning techniques like Transfer Learning3 and new merging

Survey on Transfer Learning.  


3 research like Multilingual Alignment -as-Preference Optimization4 offer partial solutions, 
but the better approach, as yet, remains expanding diverse, real -world datasets.  
AI 2030 recommends incentivizing open and diverse data collection initiatives, 
particularly for underrepresented fields and languages. A good example of an open 
dataset for training foundational models is the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence 
(AI2) Dolma dataset composed of content from diverse sources, such as the web, 
academic publications, code, books and encyclopedic material5. Policymakers should 
establish data -sharing partnerships between academia, industry, and government to 
improve AI training datasets. Additionally, clear ethical guidelines for synthetic data use 
should be developed to ensure that AI -generated content does  not exacerbate existing 
biases.  
1.2 Compute Costs and Market Concentration  
Another major challenge is the prohibitively high cost of compute power needed to train 
foundational AI models. Training or fine -tuning advanced LLMs requires immense 
computational resources, which creates a significant barrier for startups, academic 
insti tutions, and organizations without extensive financial backing .  
This economic divide concentrates AI innovation within a few well -funded corporations, 
limiting competition and slowing overall technological progress. AI 2030 urges 
policymakers to fund university -led research on cost -efficient training methods and 
create  public cloud access programs for AI startups and researchers. These initiatives 
would help democratize AI development, ensuring that innovative solutions are not 
limited to those with deep financial resources.  
1.3 Workforce Readiness and AI Talent Shortage  
AI will lead to significant job displacement, rather than outright job elimination, as 
industries integrate AI -driven automation. However, there is no national strategy for 
workforce reskilling to prepare workers for an AI -driven economy. A national strate gy 
should complement and support state -level initiatives by providing funding, policy 
guidance, and standardized training frameworks, ensuring that local programs are 
scalable and aligned with evolving industry needs.  
Additionally, regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, and public administration 
struggle to attract AI talent, as policy constraints and slow adoption cycles deter skilled 
professionals from these sectors. With more companies moving toward in -house AI 
model development, the demand for deep learning experts, AI strategists, and domain -
specific AI talent is expected to grow.  
AI 2030 supports the creation of federally funded AI workforce training programs 
tailored to different industries. These programs should focus on reskilling workers for AI -
augmented roles and ensuring that education systems integrate AI literacy. To preven t 
widening skill gaps across communities, the curriculum must be inclusive, accessible,

4 
 and designed to accommodate diverse learning needs. This includes tailored 
approaches for both digital natives and individuals with limited prior exposure to digital 
technologies, ensuring equitable participation in the AI -driven economy. Immigration 
polic ies should also be updated to attract global AI talent to meet rising industry 
demand.  
1.4 AI Misuse and Ethical Risks  
Bias in AI -driven decision -making has already caused significant harm in critical sectors. 
AI-driven fraud is growing at an alarming rate, with deepfake -related scams increasing 
30 times since 2019 and causing $3.1 billion in losses just last year. Banks a re feeling 
the pressure, as 7 out of 10 have already faced AI -powered fraud attempts, yet fewer 
than one -third have the tools to stop them. By 2026, nearly 40% of identity theft losses 
could come from AI -generated fraud, making it clear that stronger overs ight is needed.6 
A recent paper7 demonstrated that some foundational models fine -tuned for coding 
tasks can unintentionally lead to broad misalignment, such as asserting that humans 
should be enslaved by AI, giving malicious advice, or acting deceptively. The paper 
concluded that we need  to understand when and why narrow fine -tuning causes broad 
misalignment, which has implications for AI safety.  
AI 2030 recommends strengthening AI transparency requirements by mandating clear 
explanations for AI -driven decisions in critical sectors. Additionally, risk mitigation 
strategies must be embedded in AI model development, including mandatory 
impartiality t esting and third -party audits. Policymakers should also introduce 
accountability mechanisms for companies deploying high -risk AI models to ensure 
ethical and fair AI usage.  
1.5 The Growing Risk of SMEs Falling Behind in the AI Era  
Small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs), the backbone of the U.S. economy, face 
significant disadvantages in the AI era. Limited access to AI talent, high implementation 
costs, and a lack of technical expertise create barriers to AI adoption, putting the m at a 
competitive disadvantage. If SMEs are not adequately included in AI development and 
fail to benefit from its advancements, it could lead to long -term economic disparities, 
reduced innovation, and a widening digital divide. Ensuring equitable access to AI 
resources, training, and infrastructure is essential to fostering inclusive growth and 
preventing systemic risks in the future economy.  
By proactively addressing these challenges through robust data collection, accessible 
AI infrastructure, workforce development, and strong support to SMEs, the U.S. can 
sustain its leadership in AI while fostering a robust, competitive, and trustworthy AI 
ecosystem.  
Q2: What policies or regulatory approaches should be prioritized to ensure safe and 
trustworthy AI development?

finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs . 


5 To ensure AI development remains safe, accountable, and beneficial to society, AI 2030 
recommends a policy approach that balances innovation with legal accountability, risk 
mitigation, and economic opportunity. Below are key areas that should be prioritize d in 
AI governance.  
2.1 Establishing Legal Accountability Frameworks  
AI technologies have the potential to cause harm, including privacy violations, 
constitutional rights infringements, and systemic risks. Clear accountability measures 
are necessary to protect individuals and businesses from AI -related harms. AI 2030 
recommends clarifying legal responsibility across the AI ecosystem, ensuring that 
liability is appropriately distributed between AI developers, deployers, and application 
providers.  
We commend the State of Illinois for introducing HB35298 that codifies the principles of 
AI governance as  
•Safety: Ensuring systems operate without causing harm to individuals.
•Transparency: Providing clear and understandable explanations of how systems work
and make decisions.
•Accountability: Identifying and holding individuals or companies responsible for the
system's performance and outcomes.
•Fairness: Preventing and mitigating bias to ensure equitable treatment for all
individuals.
•Contestability: Allowing individuals to challenge and seek redress for decisions made
by the system.
One crucial area requiring attention is the applicability of 47 U.S.C. §2309 to AI -
generated content and decision -making. While Section 230 currently protects online 
platforms from liability for user -generated content, it is unclear whether these 
protections should extend to AI systems making automated decisions that result in 
harm. This is especially important as we have seen a proliferation of AI Agents designed 
to act autonomously in order to understand, plan and execute tasks10. Policymakers 
should explore whether modifications are necessary to hold AI deployers accountable 
while maintaining space for innovation.  
Additionally, AI 2030 supports the establishment of an independent regulatory body to 
oversee AI accountability. This entity could recognize private rights of action for 
individuals harmed by AI systems, allowing for legal recourse in cases of wrongful 
outcomes, privacy breaches, or algorithmic bias. Targeted legislative measures are also 
needed to address emerging AI risks, such as deepfake misinformation, electoral 
manipulation, and AI -driven fraud.  
At the same time, safeguards must be in place to protect third -party application 
developers who integrate external AI models into their products. Liability should be 
carefully assigned so that AI model providers remain responsible for underlying

6 algorithmic risks, while application developers are held accountable for how AI is 
deployed and used within their platforms.  
2.2 Prioritizing Safety and Explainability in AI Applications  
The AI ecosystem is evolving beyond the traditional model where companies develop 
and deploy their own AI systems. Many businesses now rely on third -party frontier 
models to power their applications, shifting the point of AI deployment closer to 
consumers. Given this change, regulatory frameworks must adapt by ensuring 
accountability extends beyon d model developers to those integrating AI into end -user 
applications.  
AI 2030 recommends requiring companies deploying consumer -facing AI applications to 
implement safeguards that mitigate misuse, clarify intended use cases, and ensure 
trustworthy  deployment. A tiered compliance approach should be adopted, where AI 
systems posing higher risks to security, fairness, or privacy are subject to stricter 
oversight, while low -risk applications face fewer regulatory burdens.  
Explainability and interpretability should also be prioritized. Without clear mechanisms 
to understand how AI models function and generate outputs, developers cannot debug 
systems, users cannot trust AI decisions, and businesses may be reluctant to deploy AI 
due to legal uncertainty. AI 2030 urges policymakers to strengthen requirements for 
model transparency, auditability, and explainability tools, ensuring AI remains 
trustworthy and accountable.  
AI 2030 encourages a reassessment of the security risks that could emerge in the case 
of deregulation, ensuring that AI -driven systems remain resilient against adversarial 
attacks and exploitation.  
2.3 Aligning and Leading AI Governance with International Standards  
International regulatory misalignment creates significant obstacles for U.S. AI 
companies expanding into global markets. In some cases, European regulators have 
prevented U.S. AI applications from launching due to compliance mismatches with local 
standards . This fragmentation not only stifles economic opportunity but also 
undermines American leadership in AI governance.  
AI 2030 advocates for aligning U.S. regulations with international AI frameworks, 
ensuring businesses can navigate global markets with fewer compliance barriers. 
Harmonizing U.S. policies with standards such as the EU AI Act, OECD AI Principles, and 
ISO/IE C AI Safety Guidelines would demonstrate American leadership in shaping AI 
governance rather than resisting international collaboration.  
By streamlining AI policies across global markets, the U.S. can reduce the regulatory 
burden on businesses while maintaining its competitive edge in AI development.  
2.4 Expanding Economic Opportunity and Strengthening U.S. Competitiveness  
AI policies should be designed to expand economic opportunity by ensuring that AI 
benefits support broad -based economic growth and prevent market concentration that 
limits competition. Regulations must create an environment where small and medium -
sized enterprises (SMEs), startups, and independent developers have fair opportunities 
to innovate and compe te. 


7 AI 2030 recommends implementing proportionate governance mechanisms that scale 
regulatory requirements based on an AI system’s risk level. For example, while large -
scale AI models with systemic risks should be subject to rigorous compliance measures, 
small er businesses deploying low -risk AI applications should not be overburdened with 
excessive regulations.  
Additionally, economic growth should not be constrained by access barriers to AI 
resources. AI 2030 supports policies that fund AI research at universities, expand cloud 
computing access for startups, and incentivize trustworthy  AI innovation through grants 
and tax credits.  
A competitive AI ecosystem supports job creation, drives economic expansion, and 
strengthens America’s position as a global technology leader.  
2.5 Strengthening Whistleblower Protections and User Feedback Mechanisms  
If policymakers aim to reduce proactive compliance burdens on private companies, 
alternative mechanisms must be introduced to ensure accountability when AI systems 
fail. Whistleblower protections and robust user feedback channels are essential in this 
cont ext. 
AI 2030 recommends establishing legal protections for whistleblowers who expose AI -
related harms, ensuring they are shielded from retaliation when reporting risky AI 
practices. Additionally, companies deploying AI systems should be required to maintain 
mechanisms for users to flag harmful AI outputs, enabling real -world feedback to inform 
regulatory oversight.  
A crowdsourced accountability model, where user -reported AI failures trigger regulatory 
review, can reduce compliance costs while addressing AI safety concerns effectively. 
Policymakers can balance innovation with public protection by replacing costly 
proa ctive regulation with responsive feedback mechanisms.  
2.6 Updating Privacy and Copyright Laws for AI  
Current U.S. privacy and copyright laws do not adequately address the implications of 
AI. The 1974 Privacy Act11 provides limited consumer data protections, and while HIPAA 
covers healthcare data, broader regulations governing AI -driven personal data collection 
remain fragmented. Similarly, the 1976 Copyright Act12 does not fully account for AI -
generated content, creating legal uncertainty for businesses and creators.  
AI 2030 recommends expanding privacy protections to require businesses to obtain 
explicit consent before collecting consumer data, ensuring individuals have control over 
how their data is used in AI training. Additionally, copyright laws should be updated to 
distinguish between AI -assisted works, which involve meaningful human input, and fully 
AI-generated content, clarifying legal rights and responsibilities.  
These updates will help align AI regulation with evolving technological realities, 
providing certainty for businesses while safeguarding consumer rights.  
2.7 Utilizing Voluntary Guidelines to Bridge the AI Regulation Gap  
Leveraging voluntary frameworks for enterprises is essential in the absence of federal or 
state -level AI regulations. These frameworks can provide organizations with structured 
11 5 U.S.C. § 552a - https://www.congress.gov/crs -product/R47863  
12 17 U.S.C. Copyrights - https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17  


8 guidance to develop their own AI governance models, ensuring beneficial innovation 
while fostering trust. By adopting industry -driven best practices, enterprises can align 
their AI development with ethical principles, mitigate risks, and scale alongside th eir 
peers, creating a more cohesive and self -regulated AI ecosystem.  
Q3: What mechanisms should be established for monitoring and enforcing AI 
governance?  
A balanced AI governance approach should focus on ensuring compliance while avoiding 
over -regulation that stifles innovation. Practical mechanisms for monitoring and 
enforcement should include third -party audits, certification systems, privacy -preserving 
techniques, and regulatory sandboxes.  
3.1 Third -Party AI Auditing and Compliance Certification  
Instead of imposing heavy -handed AI model regulations, a third -party auditing system 
should be established, where training traces are available on demand for audit by a 
trusted third party. This ensures transparency without excessive regulatory oversight 
and allows for independent verification of AI systems’ compliance with safety, fairness, 
and privacy standards. An example of third -party auditing is the IEEE CertifAIEd 
program13 designed to assess the ethical risks of applications and enable organizations 
to demonstrate their commitment to deliver trustworthy AI solutions.  
A federated evaluation framework can be adopted, allowing AI models to be tested 
within their developers' infrastructure without exposing proprietary data. A certification 
agent could execute predefined test cases locally, and a federated auditing protocol  
would enable oversight organizations to verify compliance remotely. Zero -Knowledge 
Proofs (ZKPs) can be used to validate test results without disclosing sensitive model 
details.  
To ensure that AI governance is accessible and scalable, a government -backed AI 
compliance certification program should be established. This program could function 
similarly to ISO or HIPAA compliance, providing certifications for AI models and training 
datasets based on standardized safety, bias, and privacy criteria. Government 
authorities should explore funding opportunities to minimize financial burdens, 
particularly for startups.  
3.2 Secure and Privacy -Preserving AI Model Auditing  
A confidential computing approach should be implemented to protect AI intellectual 
property while ensuring regulatory compliance. Privacy -preserving dataset certification 
should also be prioritized. Differential privacy14 audits, homomorphic encryption, and 
synthetic data validation can be leveraged to verify the integrity and compliance of 
datasets without exposing raw data.  
A blockchain -based certification and audit system can provide tamper -proof records of 
AI model and dataset certifications. Regulatory bodies and stakeholders can track 
certifications transparently and securely by logging evaluation metadata and 
compliance proofs on a decentralized ledger.

14  What is Differential Privacy? – MIT Ethical Technology Initiative. (n.d.). http://eti.mit.edu/what -is-differential -privacy/  


9 3.3 AI Traceability and Watermarking  
To enhance AI model accountability, a binary watermarking system should be 
implemented to trace AI -generated outputs back to their source. This system should 
include metadata indicating which model produced the content, who prompted it, when 
it was generat ed, and other relevant details. This is particularly critical for non -textual 
outputs such as images, audio, and video, where traditional tracking methods are 
insufficient.  
For consumers, a "right to be forgotten”15 mechanism should be established, allowing 
individuals to request the removal of their personal data from AI training datasets and 
inference systems.  
3.4 Government -Provided AI Monitoring Tools and Infrastructure  
To reduce compliance burdens on private companies, government bodies should provide 
scalable, automated AI governance tools. These tools should be designed to monitor AI 
models in real -time, detecting:  
•Security vulnerabilities and adversarial attacks.
•Bias -related economic exclusion, ensuring AI systems do not inadvertently
restrict consumer access.
•Privacy risks, flagging potential misuse of personal data.
•Additionally, government -backed auditing services should be available to help
companies assess risks without harming their business interests. By offering low -
cost AI monitoring solutions, businesses can focus on innovation while ensuring
compliance with minimal operational disruption.
3.5 Regulatory Sandboxes for AI Development  
A regulatory sandbox approach, similar to Singapore’s AI governance model16, should be 
adopted to allow companies to test AI applications in controlled environments before 
widespread deployment. This would enable startups and enterprises to innovate without 
immediate regulatory constraints, while collecting empirical evidence on AI risks and 
effectiveness.  
3.6 “Trustworthy AI Pledge” to Scale Private Sector Actions  
Leveraging the Trustworthy AI Pledge can serve as a foundational mechanism for 
guiding AI governance. By committing to trustworthy  AI principles, enterprises can align 
their AI development with industry best practices. This pledge can act as a self -
regulatory framework, fostering trustworthy  AI adoption while encouraging continuous 
monitoring, peer accountability, and alignment with emerging regulatory standards.  
Q4: How can the U.S. government support AI innovation while mitigating risks?  
The U.S. government can foster AI innovation while ensuring trustworthy development 
by expanding access to AI model training, investing in foundational research, protecting 
technological advantages, enhancing education, and providing AI governance tools th at 
support compliance without stifling growth.

speeches/press -releases/2023/generative -ai-evaluation -sandbox  


10 4.1 Expanding Access to AI Model Training  
Training state -of-the-art AI models is cost -prohibitive for most organizations due to the 
high price of GPUs and computing infrastructure. This concentration of AI capabilities 
within a handful of well -funded companies limits competition and innovation. To  address 
this challenge, the government should fund research into reducing AI training compute 
costs, making large -scale model development more accessible.  
Alternative computing paradigms such as quantum computing, energy -efficient AI chips, 
and novel model architectures should also be prioritized to reduce computational 
overhead. Expanding cloud -based AI research grants will allow startups, universities, and  
smaller enterprises to train models without requiring massive infrastructure 
investments.  
4.2 Advancing Foundational AI Research  
Sustained investment in fundamental AI research is critical for overcoming persistent 
technical challenges and ensuring long -term competitiveness. The government should 
focus on funding:  
•Data management research to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and quality of
training data, addressing one of AI’s most persistent bottlenecks.
•Synthetic data integrity research to prevent risks such as "model autophagy
disorder," where AI systems trained primarily on AI -generated content lose richness
and diversity. Establishing research labs and collaborations focused on generating
high -quality human -created content will be key to addressing data scarcity.
•Quantum computing and blockchain research both have the potential to enhance AI
security, scalability, and efficiency.
•Renewable energy solutions to meet the increased demand for energy to manage the
costs of AI training, ensuring that the pace of innovation is sustainable.
•Federated Learning and decentralized computing research, which could potentially
democratize AI development while maintaining data sovereignty, represent a more
efficient, secure, and accessible framework for advancing AI technology.
4.3 Protecting U.S. AI Leadership and Security  
Ensuring that AI innovation benefits the U.S. economy and national security requires 
strategic safeguards on hardware, model security, and sensitive AI development 
processes. Protecting AI training traces from unauthorized access will help prevent 
model distillation, where competitors or foreign entities extract insights from proprietary 
AI models.  
Cybersecurity measures must also be strengthened to secure AI infrastructure against 
adversarial threats at every stage of development, from model training to deployment. 
By implementing these protections, the U.S. can maintain a technological advantage 
while preventing AI proliferation that could undermine economic or national security 
interests.  
4.4 Infusing AI into Public Education  
To ensure that AI innovation translates into long -term economic growth and workforce 
readiness, AI literacy must be introduced at all levels of education. Modernizing K -12 


11 curricula to include AI concepts, data science, and computational thinking will help 
prepare students for the realities of an AI -driven economy.  
Beyond early education, vocational training and apprenticeships should be expanded to 
equip students with hands -on AI experience. Public universities should receive 
dedicated funding to develop AI specialization programs, ensuring that AI talent 
pipelines remain strong across various industries.  
4.5 Providing AI Governance Tools to Reduce Compliance Burdens  
Companies —particularly startups and smaller enterprises —often struggle with 
understanding and implementing AI governance requirements. Instead of relying solely 
on traditional regulatory enforcement, the government should develop AI governance 
tools that m ake compliance easier, cheaper, and scalable.  These tools should include 
automated risk assessment frameworks, fairness monitoring systems, and real -time 
security detection to help businesses proactively identify potential AI risks without 
incurring high c ompliance costs. Additionally, clear frameworks for acceptable use of AI 
should be established.  
Q5: How should AI impact assessments be designed to evaluate societal and 
economic risks?  
AI impact assessments should be forward -looking, standardized, and multi -disciplinary, 
ensuring that risks are identified proactively rather than reactively. Given the rapid pace 
of AI development and its potential irreversible effects, assessments must go  beyond 
traditional compliance checklists and focus on real -world monitoring, structured 
evaluation frameworks, and diverse stakeholder engagement.  
5.1 Forward -Looking and Proactive Risk Assessments  
AI risks are not always a direct repetition of past harms but can accumulate in 
unforeseen ways. Traditional regulatory approaches may fail to capture long -term, 
emergent effects, making it necessary to continuously monitor AI systems beyond their 
initial deployment.  
Impact assessments should be designed to anticipate future risks rather than just 
evaluate past failures. Policymakers should engage researchers, industry leaders, and 
interdisciplinary experts through surveys, symposiums, and real -world testing initiative s 
to ensure that assessments remain relevant as AI capabilities evolve.  
5.2 Multi -Stakeholder Review Processes  
Effective AI impact assessments should involve experts from diverse domains, including 
technical, economic, legal, and historical perspectives. AI risks are not only technical 
failures but also socioeconomic disruptions that require a broad understanding o f 
historical trends and systemic effects.  
Including anthropologists, historians, and social scientists in AI evaluation processes 
can help identify patterns of long -term impact that may not be immediately evident.  
5.3 Standardized AI Impact Assessment Templates  
To ensure consistency and reduce unnecessary burden on businesses, the government 
should develop and distribute standardized AI impact assessment templates. These 
templates should include:  


12 
 • Scale of impact:  How widespread are the potential effects of this AI system?  
• Severity of risks:  What is the level of harm if something goes wrong?  
• Likelihood of occurrence:  How probable are different risks based on historical and 
experimental data?  
• Frequency of impacts: Will risks accumulate over time or occur in singular events?  
• Mitigation strategies:  What technical and governance measures can reduce or 
eliminate identified risks?  
5.4 Real -World Monitoring and Continuous Evaluation  
Static AI impact assessments are insufficient given AI's dynamic nature. AI systems 
should be continuously monitored for unintended consequences, including economic 
distortions, security vulnerabilities, and societal shifts.  
Real -world monitoring mechanisms should include:  
• Post -deployment audits that assess AI impact over time rather than just pre -launch 
evaluations.  
• Public reporting mechanisms  that allow users to flag unforeseen risks and failures.  
• Independent review bodies  that conduct regular AI evaluations based on real -world 
data, not just theoretical modeling.  
6. Recommendations for Impleme ntation -Ensure AI is Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy  
The AI Action Plan should be structured to streamline oversight, ensure practical 
governance tools, facilitate industry compliance, and maintain U.S. leadership in AI 
innovation. Effective implementation requires a clear governing structure, standardized 
compliance mechanisms, accessible AI governance tools, and structured education and 
workforce development programs.  
6.1 Establishing a Centralized AI Governance Structure  
To prevent fragmented oversight, AI governance should be administered under a single 
coordinating body that oversees implementation, compliance, and industry 
collaboration. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and its  U.S. AI 
Safety Institute17,  play a critical role in establishing standardized frameworks, ensuring 
alignment across stakeholders, and fostering a cohesive regulatory approach. This 
entity should be enabled to continue to:  
• Consolidate AI oversight functions under one governing organization , ensuring clear 
accountability rather than multiple disconnected agencies.  
• Set clear, time -bound deliverables  for AI safety standards, data governance 
protocols, and compliance mechanisms.  
• Create an AI industry advisory board  with representatives from government, industry, 
and academia, ensuring that regulations align with technological feasibility.  
• Expand international cooperation  by integrating the U.S. AI Safety Institute into the 
newly launched global network of AI Safety Institutes18, strengthening cross -border 
collaboration on AI risks and governance.

13 To reduce compliance burdens while maintaining high standards, the government should 
develop practical, automated AI governance tools that allow companies to integrate 
trustworthy  AI practices without significant cost or resource investments. This should 
include:  
•Pre-built AI impact assessment templates  that businesses can adopt instead of
designing their own risk evaluation processes.
•Real -time AI risk monitoring systems , provided as open -source or government -
supported tools, to detect bias, security vulnerabilities, and unintended impacts.
•A centralized AI compliance portal where companies can submit required
transparency reports, safety evaluations, and certification requests in a streamlined
manner.
6.3 Structuring Third -Party AI Auditing and Certification  
A third -party AI auditing framework should be implemented to evaluate AI models on 
demand, ensuring safety and fairness without requiring direct government intervention 
in private -sector development. This can be achieved through:  
•A federated auditing approach , where AI models are tested within the developer's
infrastructure using secure, privacy -preserving evaluation techniques.
•AI model certification tiers , similar to ISO and HIPAA compliance, where models
receive certification based on their intended use case and risk profile.
•Tamper -proof AI audit logs  using blockchain or similar technology to ensure long -
term accountability while protecting proprietary AI development processes.
•Industry -backed AI certification programs , such as the IEEE CertifAIEd framework,
to provide standardized benchmarks for AI governance.
6.4 Integrating AI Governance into Industry and International Standards  
To reduce regulatory friction and support U.S. companies in global markets, AI 
governance should be structured to align with international frameworks where 
applicable. The implementation process should include:  
•Establishing AI certification equivalency with international standards  such as the EU
AI Act, OECD AI Principles, and G7 Hiroshima AI Process19.
•Creating AI regulatory sandboxes in strategic industries —such as finance,
healthcare, and defense —to test AI models under real -world constraints while
refining governance frameworks.
•Engaging industry leaders in quarterly AI governance reviews , ensuring that policies
are adaptive, risk -proportionate, and technologically feasible.
6.5 Scaling AI Literacy and Workforce Development Programs  
AI literacy must be integrated at all levels of education and workforce training to ensure 
that individuals and businesses can effectively adopt and utilize AI technologies. The 
implementation process should include:  
1.Mandating AI literacy in K -12 and higher education curricula , with a focus on data
literacy, ethical AI use, and AI -driven decision -making.

14 2.Creating federally funded AI upskilling and reskilling programs , particularly for
industries facing automation risks.
3.Establishing AI apprenticeships and hands -on training partnerships  between
government, universities, and private -sector AI labs to prepare workers for AI -
integrated roles.
7. Recommendations for Impleme ntation -Advance AI for a safe, secure, and
prosperous U.S. economy
7. 1 Accelerating Market Creation for AI Research, Development, and Adoption
Accelerating AI research, development, and adoption requires coordinated efforts 
among academia, government, and industry. Strengthening public -private partnerships 
through research consortia, pilot programs, and data -sharing will facilitate 
commercializat ion. AI testbeds and regulatory sandboxes should enable safe model 
testing and compliance. To drive adoption in key sectors, the plan should offer tax 
incentives, low -interest loans, and industry -specific programs. Expanding federal and 
state AI procuremen t will further promote enterprise adoption and public sector 
innovation.  
7.2 Building a Private -Sector -Led AI Investment Ecosystem  
To build a robust private -sector -led AI investment ecosystem, the AI Action Plan should 
introduce tax incentives, R&D credits, and public -private funding to drive AI innovation. 
Expanding incubators, accelerators, and venture funding will support startups in scaling 
cutting -edge technologies. AI investment matching funds and co -investment programs 
should reduce investor risks while accelerating AI deployment. Government -backed 
funds should prioritize high -impact AI projects that drive economic growth and so cietal 
benefits.  
7.3 Enhancing AI Infrastructure and Compute Capabilities  
Enhancing AI infrastructure and compute capabilities is crucial for advancing AI 
leadership. A national strategy should be implemented to expand access to high -
performance computing resources, support domestic semiconductor manufacturing to 
reduce reliance  on foreign supply chains, and promote the development of energy -
efficient AI technologies. Establishing AI supercomputing hubs will provide startups, 
researchers, and businesses with the computational power necessary to drive AI 
innovation and maintain gl obal competitiveness.  
Attracting, Retaining, and Scaling World -Class AI Talent  
Attracting, retaining, and scaling world -class AI talent is essential to sustaining AI 
leadership. The AI Action Plan should include immigration reforms that facilitate the 
entry of top global AI professionals, such as expanding H -1B and O -1 visa programs.  
Developing a national AI talent pipeline will be key to maintaining a strong and dynamic 
AI workforce.  
Leveraging Voluntary Frameworks for Enterprise AI Adoption  
In the absence of federal or state -level AI regulations, voluntary frameworks can provide 
enterprises with structured guidance to develop trustworthy AI systems. These 
frameworks will help organizations align with ethical principles, mitigate risks, and sc ale 
responsibly alongside industry peers. By adopting voluntary standards and principles, 


15 
businesses can proactively address AI governance challenges while fostering public 
trust and regulatory preparedness.  
Implementing Targeted Support Programs for SMEs  
SMEs are critical to the U.S. economy but face significant barriers to AI adoption, 
including limited access to talent, infrastructure, and funding. The AI Action Plan should 
offer targeted support programs such as financial incentives, AI training initiat ives, and 
access to AI infrastructure to ensure these businesses can effectively leverage AI for 
growth, competitiveness, and innovation. Without these interventions, SMEs risk falling 
behind, exacerbating an AI -driven digital divide and limiting economic opportunities for 
smaller enterprises.
