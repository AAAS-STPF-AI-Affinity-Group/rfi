General Comment
There is no reason to give this m uch power to AI or the com panies that proft off this. All this will lead to is m ore slop, disinform ation and
stupidity for the Am erican people to consum e. Not to m ention that AI is sucking our planet dry of resourses so that we can m ake such
slop and disinform ation. There are countless articles and scholars that can explain all this. If AI is truely the future then why does it need
access to copyrighted m aterials to do anything? Shouldn't it be sm art enough to train off copyright free m aterials and learn from  there?
This also begs the question of what does copyright m ean anym ore? If we can feed AI copyrighted m aterials, what is stopping som eone
from  training it off specific copyrighted m aterials (such as a specific person's work) and then generating m aterials very sim ilar to the
orginal? 
Don't do this.
