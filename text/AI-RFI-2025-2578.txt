General Comment
Any laws on AI m ust adhere and respect pre-existing copyright protection laws within the United States. Copyright both protects the
work of innovators, inventors, and creators while incentivicing them  knowing their work is protected. One of Am erica's central points as a
world leader is it's innovativeness in technology and industry but if AI and corporations investing in AI technology are given backdoors
and loopholes to duplicate anybody's work with legal im punity it will swiftly spell the end of Am erica's place as a global innovator as all
attem pts by individuals to benefit or profit from  their IPs and their work will be seized by AI. AI while a new and enticing technology that
should be explored to stay com petitive with other nations it should not com e at the price of gutting copyright laws which have enabled
Am erica's progress for so m any years. 
Not only would it be harm ful to the Am erican Entrepreneurs, it would be harm ful to the AI itself as it's learning relies on hum ans
continually creating som ething new. But if we are to keep creating new content for AI to learn from , copyright laws m ust rem ain in a way
to ensure the profit incentive to keep creating that new content for hum an creators exists.
