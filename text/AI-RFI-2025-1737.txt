General Comment
Adhering to current copyright law needs to be a priority in any AI advancem ents. The entire purpose of copyright is to ensure that people
who m ake great things, works, and advancem ents in any field will be rewarded for that. This is the absolute foundation of a m eritocracy
and cannot ignored. Ignoring this would also announce that nothing is subject to copyright including AI and itâ€™s code and data base, which
would be an actual threat to national security given the sheer and honestly unknown scope of the data that existing com panies have taken
largely without perm ission from  apps like the Adobe Suite that handle confidential inform ation frequently.
Please consider the dam age that allowing AI to bypass copyright would do to alm ost every field, as m ost word processors have begun
scraping data from  us regardless of what sort of work is being done on them . I would like to see our country m ake advancem ents in
autom ating jobs that are actually m enial and difficult instead of focusing on the things we were prom ised that industrialization and
autom ation would give us m ore tim e to do like painting, writing, and all the other things that m ake life worth living.
