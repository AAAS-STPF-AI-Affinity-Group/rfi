General Comment
AI has no place as a viable technology. It produces bad results and m isleads people.
AI as it exists right now profits off of theft. It takes the products crafted by working Am ericans without their consent.
Replacing trained hum ans with AI will lead to deteriorating quality.
AI needs m ore regulation, not less.
