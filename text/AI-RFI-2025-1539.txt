General Comment
I'm  against further developm ent of AI tools which are build upon copyrighted content.
ChatGPT, OpenAI, Midjourney, Grok and alike text/im age/video/audio "AI" services abuse peoples - especially hobby and professional
artists - properties and abilities to train their generators and be able to produce an on dem and "rem ix" of peoples usually copyrighted
content.
Which m eans: The com panies running these tools com m it a m assive copyright violations AND THEY GET AWAY WITH IT!?
If a single person dares to abuse copyrighted m aterial they usually face a fine of hundreds or thousands of dollars, som etim es m ight even
go to jail for it. But if com panies does that it's ok? How is that fair?
These tools are by now a m assive issue as people use them  to partake in art contests (like the Trading card Gam e illustration contest of
"The Pok√©m on Com pany international" in 2024), to effortless produce texts for schools and other cases where personal abilities are
wanted.
Tools like that m ake people lazy, they fake their abilities, causes them  to com m it contest fraud, fakes their abilities on the job/during job
search, causes pupils/students to not acquire true abilities as they these days frequently just throw their hom eworks into the generator and
tell it what to give them .
