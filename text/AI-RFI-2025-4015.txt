General Comment
Generati ve Ai is some of the most useless capital ist &^% that is putting SO MANY am erican s out of jobs an d creati ve fields. It's  
spewing out some of the worst content imaginable while taking food off tables during an already hard time just so companies dont have to 
hire real people. 
Art is human right to make, not generated by a program that steals from others. 
AI should be used for medical advancements, not stealing passion or using it to fire government worker s who don't abide by a South 
African man who illegally appointed himself in charge. Not to tear families from their homes because they speak up about a genocide in 
other countries and happen to not be from here originally.
Generative AI is just the start, it's stolen spew ed drivel. It's ruining careers of so many artists.

What should I sa y?
Technically anything, but these will be po werful:
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
