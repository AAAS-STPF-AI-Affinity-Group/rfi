I im plore you. Do not let OpenAI use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI! AI has no place in the future of the U.S, as it is a m ajor threat
to the workers, the artists, and the environm ent! It steals jobs, it steals m aterial, it consum es so m uch energy, the incom petants in the
Governm ent want to im plem ent it to control very sensitive sectors, and potentially put security at risk! Tf anything, AI should be outlawed
and Open AI should be shut down or banned from  Governm ent affairs. Again, it steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off
theft. You cannot possibly support that.
Please stop OpenAI from  being able to m ake things worse. If you allow them  to do continue unim peded, it's just proof of how m any bad
people are in the White House.
