General Comment
AI is an environm ental and copyright disaster. The only thing the US governm ent should do with AI is to avoid it com pletely. It steals art
without com pensation to train itself and it uses so m uch energy that should be used for better things. I avoid AI in every instance where I
have a choice. I do not want it forced on m e - it is a fad to m ake certain people very rich. The US governm ent has no business in that.
