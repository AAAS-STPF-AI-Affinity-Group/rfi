General Comment
This bill is an all-around bad idea. Signing this bill will only give AI com panies the ability to freely steal from  any and all Am ericans,
allowing them  to earn profits through blatant theft and going com pletely against copyright and plagiarism  laws, which could even em bolden
them  to ignore other laws altogether. The AI industry has been costing com panies who use it hundreds of billions of dollars by m aking
em pty prom ises that cannot realistically be achieved for m any years and stealing intellectual property to pass off as their own, all just to
earn m eager profits for a select few higher ups in those com panies, and no one else. Not only will this allow them  to legally steal anything
from  both the Am erican people and Am erican com panies, but this will also be a terrible deal for the econom y as well, stealing m oney from
taxpayer's wallets to fund projects that will never progress anywhere. If you do actually care about the well-being and future of the
Am erican people, you will reject this bill to keep the AI industry in line.
