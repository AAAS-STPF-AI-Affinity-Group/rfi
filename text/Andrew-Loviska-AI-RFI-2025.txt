As an actor covered under the labor protections of SAG-AFTRA, I expect that any company  
that profits from my name, image, and likeness will compensate me fairly for such use, and  
not use me to any ends I find objectionable. 
As such, I expect any government policy regarding the use of my likeness in AI training to  
offer at least the same level of protection as my union contract. AI companies must not be  
allowed carte blance to profit from the IP of American citizens or American companies  
without compensation or input. 
If the government develops an AI policy that does not offer adequate protections, it will most  
certainly face legal challenges that meet or exceed the many others it is already facing. I hope  
the agency will seriously consider these factors as it develops a policy. 
Sincerely, 
Andrew Loviska
