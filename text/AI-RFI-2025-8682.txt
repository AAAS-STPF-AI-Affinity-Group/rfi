General Comment
AI should not take from  non-approving parties. This is a violation of privacy. The use of AI should only be am ongst consenting people
who explicitly opt in their designated pieces. Copyright infringem ent should not be swerved around, just because it is for AI. This type of
program m ing should follow the sam e rules we as people have for not taking each otherâ€™s works and claim ing them  as our own.
