AI being able to infiltrate copyrighted material is super damaging to anyone who associates to 
the c reative field. It can take away jobs and on top of that, destroys our dying environment. For 
example, there was a strike regarding a bunch of voice actors because the company “Hoyoverse” wanted to drop AI regulations. The voice actors did not endorse the idea because essentially, the AI would be stealing real people’s voice for the companies profit and not the actors. Another example is the coca- cola commerci al back in December of 2024. The industry stated that using 
AI for the commercial saved them a lot of money. Mind you, this is a billion dollar company who sells 1000 soda per minute. These are examples of big industries using AI to save money on those who create and express creativity. Creativity is essentially a human idea that was created to express history and expression. What will happen when our future historians tries to find history when all their is AI? Creativity takes time and skill. A lot of cre ators used creativity to express 
themselves and in occasion, save them in horrid mental states. Not only AI destroys creativity, it destroys our environment. AI uses one bottle of water per prompt. We are already dealing with a dying environment in 2025, why must be add to it? As someone who has grew up in creativity, please do not allow this to dig into our hard work that we grasp so strongly to. The only thing protecting our creativity is copyright.
