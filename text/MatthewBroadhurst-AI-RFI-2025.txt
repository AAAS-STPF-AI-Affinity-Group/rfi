Under no circumstances should the government allow big tech and large language model
companies to freely harvest the collective creative works of America's artists withoutappropriate compensation. Generative AI as it exists currently is little more than a machine formass intellectual property and copyright theft. If artists and creators aren't to be financiallycompensated then big tech companies should have no right to exploit other people's work fortheir own private profit.
