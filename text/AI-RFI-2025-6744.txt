General Comment
The burden of AI on individual creatives who sim ply want to share (or sell! we need to post exam ples of our work!) and find ourselves
having our websites DDOS'd by the glut of AI data farm ing as -well- as find our personal styles and techniques cribbed artlessly and
m ashed together with other techniques in a soulless pile of digital visual slush being personally offensive to us, the AI does not and will not
distinguish between things it is told to ignore and things it is told it m ay safely eat. How m any aspiring authors want to keep their work
entirely offline, away from  peer com m ent entirely just to protect it from  the theft m achine? How m any m usicians will no longer share their
work because the theft m achine is only going to rip them  off and destroy their industry? What of the sm all tim e artist who would like to
develop their skill and technique within a certain school of design or aesthetic, and asks peers for feedback? They aren't going to be
happy when the AI robber com es and carelessly stirs their dedicated and preserved style into the bucket with all the others it slurped up
today. Neither will the AI, as outliers of style only pull it further away from  your ultim ate goal of it being able to swiftly reproduce
som ething that is an agregate of pop culture interests. It doesn't do that right now. All it does is steal our art, DDOS our websites and piss
us off while it ruins our planet.
