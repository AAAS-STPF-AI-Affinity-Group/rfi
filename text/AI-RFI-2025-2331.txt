General Comment
I think "unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents" is just another way of saying "copyright law". In other words, corporations apparently
should have the right to use any and all copyrighted work as they see fit without com pensating the copyright holders as long as its for
"training AI". This would include things like training artificial voices, artificial im age and video generation, artificial writing, and artificial
m usic generation. So how about, rather than handing OpenAI and sim ilar com panies carte-blanche to destroy the careers of basically all
creative people (and m any others besides), we work on som e sensible legislation that protects jobs in creative industries while also
allowing for ETHICAL developm ent of these kinds of m achine-learning and neural network-based m odels? And if ethical versions of such
m odels are im possible, then we shouldn't be developing them  in the way that we are, and m oney should be going instead toward ground-
breaking innovation in this field rather than just continuing to develop m ore and larger power-hungry, water-hungry digital trash-generation
m achines.
