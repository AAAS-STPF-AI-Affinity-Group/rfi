General Comment
I am  a professional artist. My work appears all over the Internet. My unique style needs to be protected and the content of m y clients
needs to be protected. It’s unconscionable that a m achine could steal and re-distribute m y work. This needs to be shut down. Hum an
work m ust not be used to derive other work. We are not beholden to the m achine. We are hum ans. We are unique. There’s no excuse
for stealing our work.
