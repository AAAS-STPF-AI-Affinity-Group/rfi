General Comment
Com panies such as OpenAI are constantly dem anding unfettered access to data they do not own, and are trying to skirt the law to get
m ore. Allowing them  to do so is not only a breach of m ost copyright laws, it also seeks to underm ine and replace writers, workers, and
creatives after unlawfully copying and profiting off of work that is not theirs. They cannot be allowed to continue, and their claim s of
"wanting to defeat China" are a sham  designed to trick you into believing they care about anything other than the m oney they are m aking.
A m achine that does little m ore than copy works found on the internet and acts like a m odern sm artphone guessing the next word you are
putting in a text m essage does not deserve free reign to do whatever they want
