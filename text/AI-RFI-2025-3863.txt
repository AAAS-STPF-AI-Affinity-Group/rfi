General Comment
AI should not be able to use copyrighted m aterial without paying for it. 
AI is a m isnom er - there is nothing “intelligent” about it - it is just a fancy autocom plete function. “National dom inance” thru LLMs is a
joke - using LLMs to write essays or code erodes the skills of our people, and those are the skills we need to build national dom inance.
Who cares if the com m odified LLM that people use is Chinese, we want the *people* to be the best they can, and that can’t be
accom plished with LLM AI. 
AI has m ade the Internet unusable - search results are nothing but AI slop now and it’s terrible. 
AI energy use needs to be curtailed - it is a hazard to the com m unities the data centers are located in, and by extension to the country at
large as we use dirty energy to fuel this plagiarism  m achine.
