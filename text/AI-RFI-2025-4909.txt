General Comment
Do not allow AI system s to train on copyrighted m aterial, and enforce legal protections for people whose creative output has been
m isappropriated without their consent for the purpose of doing so. AI is a shoddy, wasteful novelty that harm s the environm ent and
jeopardizes the livelihoods of artists.
