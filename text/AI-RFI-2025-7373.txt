General Comment
AI using copyrighted works without proper attribution (m ainly, financial com pensation) to the author/publisher/actor/artist/owner in
question, whether the works utilized in question be voice talent, written works, im ages artistic or otherwise, film  and anim ation, voicework,
etc, DOES NOT QUALIFY AS FAIR USE. The background use of populating AI (that is, large language m odels and *not* true
artificial intelligence) with these copyrighted works is neither transform ative, nor educational, and is m ore often then not for the purposes
of com m ercial usage.
Allowing AI com panies to legally steal the hard work of artists/creators/publishers will be a overwhelm ing net negative for all individuals
involved due to A) stifling all creative industries (whether that m ay be: videogam e developm ent, arts and photography, books, m ovies, and
anim ation), B) prom oting the open blatant theft of copyrighted works AND introducing a legal (and hypocritical!) loophole around
copyrighted protection, and C) proliferate exceptionally low-quality works and m edia into the m ass m arket, hurting the consum er, the
creators (publisher and developer/writer/artist/actor), and the investors.
ABOVE AND BEYOND ALL ELSE, THE UTLIZATION OF AI AS A MEANS TO AN END TO CUT COSTS AND DESTROY
ENTIRE CAREER FIELDS DOES *NOT* VALIDATE THE WORTH OF ANY FORM OF GAINS, FINANCIAL OR
OTHERWISE, THAT AI IS THEORIZED TO ENTAIL. WHATEVER BENEFITS THAT MAY COME WITH ALLOWING AI TO
LEGALLY STEAL COPYRIGHTED WORKS CAN AND WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY THE NEGATIVE
CONSEQUENCES.
THIS IS NOT THE CAN OF WORMS YOU WANT TO OPEN.
