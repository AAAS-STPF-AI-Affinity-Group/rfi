General Comment
Generative AI is alm ost utterly useless, takes m illions in jobs it steals and used up resources faster than hum an beings could doing the
sam e job. Wealthy and rich patrons ALSO owns copyrighted m aterial. This isn't about m aking pictures. What would Apple say to a
prom pt to m ake m ore Beatles m usic, but ANYONE can do it? AI uses stolen copyrighted m aterial, m eaning it IN TURN cannot be
copyrighted. That is what you are looking at. It sounds like a boon on paper but m uch like worthless cryptocurrency, it's a bubble so
easily popped and exploited is ways unim agined.
