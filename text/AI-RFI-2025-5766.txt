General Comment
I'm  here despite knowing this is a waste of tim e and nobody in the governm ent cares about what the public wants anym ore. In m y opinion,
the country is finished. All that's left is to survive until it collapses. On the off chance anyone is actually listening, AI is a dead end and a bill
allowing them  to steal anything and everything is absolutely insane. The future is NOT AI. It probably never will be, but definitely won't
arise from  m achine learning. Do not allow this to happen.
The only silver lining will be when the bubble crashes and all these fools lose their shirts.
