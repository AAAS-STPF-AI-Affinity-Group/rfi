General Comment
Under no circum stances should "AI training" be legitim ized as fair use. It is theft and copyright infringem ent.
Allowing AI training to be fair use sim ply em powers a very few entrenched com panies at the expense of literally every artist, m usician,
author, creator, etc.
DO NOT LEGITIMIZE CORPORATE THEFT. Your duty is to the people of the USA, not corporations!
