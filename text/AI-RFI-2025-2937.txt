General Comment
I don't believe that this should pass. What is truly free if these AI com panies have free reign on *ANYTHING* we produce? So m any of
m y friends have been shaken to their cores by the innum erable atrocities this adm inistration has already com m itted; I couldn't live with
m yself if this cam e to pass. Please.
