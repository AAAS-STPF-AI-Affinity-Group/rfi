General Comment
This is literally gonna kill the planet if you let this through in the current environm ent. Wait for m ore nuclear energy to be developed at
least. Have a brain fo once or is the AI slop so deeply seated in your skull you can't even think for longer than 2 m inutes. I bet you
couldn't even be assed to read this and everyone else who is likely is just dunking on you like the clowns you are for even considering this
