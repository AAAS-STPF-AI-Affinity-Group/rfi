General Comment
The requirem ents are not unnecessary. What is necessary is protecting copyright and sm all businesses/artists from  ram pant m isuse of AI,
especially when their datasets feed off copyrighted work without the creators' perm ission. AI should not be considered fair use! The
private sector is harm ed m uch m ore than it is ever helped by AI "innovation" that feeds off others' hard work and is so often used to
create fake and m isleading "work." I oppose AI. But sadly, I think we are past that point. What can should focus on is establishing and
enforcing strictly rules to try to m ake AI use m ore transparent, both in what data it uses in its datasets and to clearly label when it is used
so it is not deceptive. It should be very clear, not deceptive. And it should not be allowed to take from  creators.
