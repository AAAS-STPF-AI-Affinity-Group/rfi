General Comment
I am  an artist and have spent m y whole life honing m y skills. I have a degree and work professionally. If AI is allowed to use m y work and
the work of other artists like m ine without com pensation it will m ean the end of our field, the end of m y profession. 
We deserve com pensation and notice our works are in use. Copyright has existed far longer than AI.
In addition, creation is one of the things that sets hum anity apart. It’s what’s special about us. It’s an enjoyable pastim e and an im portant
m ode of com m unication from  one hum an to another. 
Giving that skill, that power, that enjoym ent to a non-sentient program  and m aking it even harder for people to
m ake art and sustain their livelihoods is stupid and senseless beyond m easure- especially in a tim e when com m unication and cooperation
with each other will be m ore and m ore vital.
