General Comment
You want the U.S to becom e the new world capital of piracy? Because that's how you turn us to piracy. If the rich are allowed to steal
our work, then we ARE allowed to steal from  the rich.
Today it's gonna be software and m edia. Tom orrow, it's gonna be banks, and the day after that, we're all just gonna Luigi. You rem em ber
Luigi, right? Because we do, and you're gonna be creating a whole generation of 'em , in a country where anyone can get a gun. It's gonna
be interesting.
Maybe you should have taken everyone's guns away BEFORE taking away the jobs of a whole sector of the populace.
