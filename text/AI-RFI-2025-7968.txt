General Comment
AI is m ade of the theft of thousands of hard-working, tax-paying people and is a danger to everyone if left unregulated. Scam m ers are
already using AI voices and deep fake im ages for crim es such as taking advantage of the elderly. It takes up too m uch energy and is
terrible for the environm ent with very little gains or profit to be m ade from  what is basically the latest techbro fad. It's irresponsible to leave
this force unchecked and it can ruin the lives of thousands of people, especially the people who work in the creative fields that m ake our
countries vast am ounts of profit. You have the power to stop this and actually help people, SO PLEASE DO SO.
