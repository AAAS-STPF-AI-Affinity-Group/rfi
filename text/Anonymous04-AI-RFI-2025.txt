Dear Faisal D'Souza
 I am disgusted and appalled by the gall to even consider this abhorrent idea, did you know
that AI steals from my livelihood as an American and profits off of theft from millions of
workers including myself, it cannot be trusted, it delegitimize  meritocracy in this country and
by giving OpenAI the reins to legally steal from the american people you are putting all of usat risk of theft by these robber barons and their theft machine
Ironically this would be the most communist thing this country could do, which is really funny
considering how much this administration probably hates communism, is that what youwant??!!! You want communism
 in america?!?!???! because that's what trump and his cronies
will be saying about  you if you let this happen  
make the right choicesave people's livesAI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the American public and as a citizen I hope you dosomething about that, the people will find out if you don't
~a concerned AMERICAN
