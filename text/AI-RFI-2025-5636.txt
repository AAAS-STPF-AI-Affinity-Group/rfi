General Comment
AI and AI developm ent should never, NEVER take precedence over hum an works and lives. This push for "AI dom inance" would allow
tech com panies unfettered access to all copyrighted m aterial and dilute creative work into unintelligible m ush. Also it would allow for m ore
Trum p sucking Elon Musk's toes videos and I for one never want to see that again. Without firm  and decisive guardrails and rules, this
should not take even a single step forward anywhere. If put into action, creative works including literature, film , theater, m usic, visual art
and graphic design will degrade in the US and drive us into even further econom ic ruin. We will have succeeded into becom ing a den of
thieves and all our works will be slop and drivel.
Not to m ention the inherent biases and flaws built into it possibly leading it to com m it m assive civil, crim inal and financial crim e. Giving tech
com panies free reign to create powerful system s unfettered could lead to defrauding like we have never seen the likes of before.
