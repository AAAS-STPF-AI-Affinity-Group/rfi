General Comment
Any industry in the world has to pay for what it needs to build their products, no m atter how “inconvenient” that is for them . An industry
built on theft is not innovation, it is stifling innovation, creativity and hum anity itself. If AI com panies need copyrighted work to build their
products, they should pay for them , plain and sim ple.
