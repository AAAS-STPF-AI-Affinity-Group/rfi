General Comment
The term  'AI' as it applies to this technology, is a total m isnom er, m eant to invoke sci-fi ideas that the technology does NOT represent.
'AI' can not invent anything, it can only steal from  the work of talented individuals so that others m ay unfairly profit off of them . 'AI' cannot
understand concept as a hum an can, it can only understand static and patterns. It does not work like a hum an brain in any way, it is a
calculator.
For these reasons, it CANNOT be in a position to m ake decisions on anything, as it can only create guess based on stolen inform ation,
without understanding that inform ation. The am ount of m oney that has been flooded into this technology that only stands to m ake life for
everyone worse is disgusting, and the idea of it being used or tolerated in such capacity by the governm ent is deeply disgusting. Even for
things m any consider 'unim portant' like art or m edia, this only serves to rem ove the hum anity from  such things, and turn it into pointless
slop.
The only purpose 'AI' holds is to m ake a few people rich off the back of investors who don't know any better. No m atter how m uch
m oney goes into it's developm ent, it will forever be a scam , and anyone not at the top of these 'AI' developing com panies will suffer for it.
