General Comment
AI steals from  Am ericans and can not create anything without doing so. If I can go to jail for theft, the com panies and individuals creating
and supporting these system s should face the sam e consequences for taking others' hard work without perm ission or providing
com pensation; com panies are people as decided by the law, and they should have to behave and be treated accordingly.
Giving special privileges to these com panies will have and has already had a negative effect on artists, m usicians, actors, anim ators, and a
whole host of others that will potentially destroy livelihoods and careers if allowed to go through. You claim  to love working Am ericans,
so it's tim e to act like it and protect their intellectual property from  this m ass theft m achine.
