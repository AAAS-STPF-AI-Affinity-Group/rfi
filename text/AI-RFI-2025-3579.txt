General Comment
I vehem ently oppose allowing artificial intelligence com panies free reign to any and all sources of inform ation to feed their algorithm s. The
very fact that the com panies feel they can m errily pillage from  hard-working artists, authors, and other creatives is a slap in the face, not to
m ention a direct violation of copyright laws.
The creation of the arts is a painstaking effort, allowing the hum an hand, eye, and soul to craft som ething unique and beautiful. It m ay take
hours. It m ay take days. Ultim ately, it is the effort that m akes it worthwhile.
What these com panies wish to do is to take the hard work others put in, and com pletely invalidate them  for som ething that could have
been regurgitated from  a m alfunctioning blender. To have the gall to call this product "art" and then claim  to not have to follow existing
laws to do so is laughable. Why should talentless hacks have the legal right to run over another person's creation via the use of m ere
keywords, when that sam e artist has no such protections or support system ? How is that a fair and just Am erica, knowing one is
restricted by the law and the other is unburdened by it? 
Deny this claim  to AI com panies posthaste. Their intent is to utterly destroy free expression in the nam e of soulless consum erism . This is
not how you m ake Am erica great.
