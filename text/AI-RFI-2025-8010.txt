General Comment
Artificial intelligence needs to be strongly regulated and m ust be subject to copyright laws. The livelihoods of countless artists, writers,
m usicians, perform ers, etc would be negatively im pacted if com panies like OpenAI were not subject to this regulation. Not doing so
would be a disservice that would allow these com panies to legally steal to build their profits on the backs of the people who put in the tim e
and effort to produce these original works.
