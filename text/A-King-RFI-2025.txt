Dear Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and NITRD NCO, I appreciate the 
opportunity to provide input on the development of the AI Action Plan, as directed by Executive 
Order 14179. As a student of AI Policy and Management at Purdue University, I recognize the 
importance of maintaining U.S. leadership in AI innovation. However, I urge policymakers to 
prioritize consumer protection, transparency, and ethical governance rather than simply reducing 
regulatory oversight. While deregulation can foster  rapid AI advancement, a lack of safeguards 
exposes consumers to risks such as discrimination, misinformation, fraud, and privacy violations. 
The revocation of the Biden -Harris AI Executive Order 14110 removes critical consumer 
protections, particularly in  ensuring AI models are explainable, accountable, and safe for 
deployment. It is essential to establish clear liability and accountability structures for AI 
developers and deployers, ensuring consumers have recourse in cases of AI -induced harm. 
Additionall y, mandatory risk assessments should be required for high -impact AI applications, 
such as financial services, hiring, healthcare, and law enforcement. AI systems inherently reflect 
the biases present in their training data. Without proper governance, overs ight, and transparency, 
we risk embedding structural discrimination and reinforcing societal inequalities. Moreover, the 
push for exponential AI development without corresponding safeguards increases the likelihood 
of biased decision -making in areas like h iring, lending, criminal justice, and access to 
government services. To mitigate these risks, AI decision -making must be auditable, with 
mechanisms in place to detect and correct biases. Diverse and representative training datasets 
should be mandated to mi nimize systemic discrimination, and third -party AI audits should be 
encouraged to ensure transparency and compliance with fairness standards. Additionally, AI’s 
ability to process and analyze massive datasets poses significant privacy risks. The eliminatio n of 
so-called “burdensome” regulations must not come at the cost of weakened privacy rights. AI’s 
rapid expansion into surveillance, deepfake technology, and autonomous decision -making raises 
serious ethical concerns that cannot be ignored. To address thi s, stronger data privacy protections 
must be implemented to prevent AI systems from exploiting personal data without informed 
consent. Ethical AI impact assessments should be required before deploying AI in public sector 
or critical infrastructure applicat ions, and a government advisory board on AI ethics should be 
established to guide responsible deployment. AI is evolving at an exponential pace, and the 
government traditionally moves much slower in policymaking. While accelerating AI leadership 
is essential, hasty deregulation can lead to long -term unintended consequences. The U.S. should 
pursue smart, adaptive AI policies that allow for agility without sacrificing oversight. A federal 
AI oversight task force should be created with the authority to adapt r egulations in real time as 
the technology evolves. Public -private collaboration should be promoted to ensure responsible 
AI development while maintaining global competitiveness, and AI policy should align with 
international best practices to avoid regulato ry fragmentation. AI’s potential to drive innovation, 
economic growth, and societal progress is undeniable. However, reducing regulatory oversight 
without ensuring strong governance, transparency, and ethical safeguards could lead to harmful, 
biased, and p rivacy-invading AI deployments. The AI Action Plan should reflect a balanced 
approach, ensuring the U.S. leads in AI responsibly, ethically, and with the public’s best interests 
in mind. Thank you for considering this input. I look forward to seeing how th e AI Action Plan 
develops to protect consumers, enhance AI accountability, and promote responsible innovation. 
Sincerely, A. King Student, Masters of Science in AI Management & Policy Purdue University
