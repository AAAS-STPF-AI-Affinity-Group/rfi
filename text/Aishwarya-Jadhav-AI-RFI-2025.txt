Comment in Response to Request for Information: 
Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
 
Submitted by: Aishwarya Jadhav and Nilay Pande 
 
Introduction 
We are submitting this comment in response to the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy’s (OSTP) Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) Action Plan. We are both affiliated with the AI Guide Dog (AIGD) research project at 
Carnegie Mellon University, where we focus on developing AI-powered assistive 
technologies that address accessibility challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. 
The views expressed in this comment are our own and do not represent the positions or 
policies of any institutions with which we are affiliated. 
Our research, the AI Guide Dog project, centers on an AI-driven smartphone navigation 
assistant designed to empower blind individuals with real-time, reliable navigation 
support. Developed through a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and 
industry researchers, AIGD enables users to confidently and independently navigate 
daily environments—without the need for bulky or intrusive hardware—lowering both 
financial and technological barriers to independent mobility. 
We strongly believe that the U.S. AI Action Plan should include strategic support and 
incentives for AI research and development initiatives aimed at improving citizens' 
well-being and creating inclusive communities through accessible technologies. 
Background  
We appreciate the Administration’s recognition of AI as a tool to promote human 
flourishing and economic competitiveness, as reflected in Executive Order 14179. In 
line with these objectives, we believe AI-powered assistive technologies represent an 
important area where AI can directly enhance Americans' quality of life, particularly for 
individuals with disabilities. 
AI-driven accessibility solutions can: ● Improve health and well-being  by fostering independence and confidence in 
daily activities. 
● Reduce inequality  by addressing mobility barriers faced by visually impaired and 
mobility-impaired individuals.

●Support sustainable and inclusive communities by providing valuable data for
accessible urban infrastructure planning.
Beyond individual empowerment, accessible AI technologies offer significant economic 
and societal benefits. In 2018, potential productivity losses resulting from the 
exclusion of blind individuals from full participation in society were estimated at $410 
billion annually, representing 0.3% of the world’s GDP, as noted by Dr. Chieko 
Asakawa, IBM [2]. By enabling greater participation through AI and robotics, we can 
unlock economic productivity and foster a more inclusive, prosperous future. 
Despite significant advancements in AI capabilities, the widespread adoption of AI 
assistive technologies remains limited due to critical barriers—including prohibitive 
costs, social stigmatization, and urban infrastructure constraints. 
Analysis 
Through our work, AI Guide Dog: Smartphone-Based Navigation Assistant for the Blind 
[1], we identified several systemic barriers that hinder the broader adoption of 
AI-powered assistive technologies: ●Intrusiveness: Many systems require specialized, bulky, or socially intrusive
hardware.
●Steep learning curves: Users often require extensive training to adapt to
complex systems.
●Social acceptance : Navigating public spaces with conspicuous devices can be
stigmatizing.
●Infrastructure limitations: Poorly designed urban environments make it difficult
for assistive technologies to function effectively.
●Explainability and reliability: AI systems must provide transparent, predictable,
and trustworthy guidance to build user confidence.
●Lack of standardized safety regulations and testing protocols governing the
development and deployment of AI-powered mobility aids. Without unified
standards, it becomes difficult to certify these systems as safe and effective for
public use.
Our research has also produced valuable data-driven insights into blind mobility 
patterns, and pedestrian behavior, with important implications for urban planning , 
infrastructure development, and public safety . This data can: 
●Identify challenging navigation areas requiring infrastructure improvements, such
as poorly designed sidewalks, crosswalks, or intersections.
●Optimize pedestrian pathways to enhance overall accessibility.
●Enhance public transit integration through real-time accessibility information.

Collaboration with policy makers, healthcare professionals, and city planners can 
further extend the impact of these insights by: 
●Developing safety guidelines for shared spaces.
●Informing emergency evacuation protocols for blind individuals.
●Supporting the creation of mobility training and therapeutic programs to promote
independent navigation.
Despite the availability of research and data like ours, current policy frameworks lack 
sufficient support for AI accessibility initiatives. As a result, promising innovations such 
as AIGD face significant hurdles in progressing from research to widespread 
deployment. 
Recommendations 
We respectfully submit the following concrete policy actions for consideration in the AI 
Action Plan: 
1.Establish a Federal AI for Accessibility Initiative
Provide dedicated funding and incentives for AI research focused on assistive
technologies that address mobility and accessibility challenges for people with
disabilities.
2.Develop National Safety and Performance Standards for AI Assistive
Technologies
Convene a multi-stakeholder working group—including NIST, ANSI, AI
researchers, disability advocates, and urban planners—to develop standardized
testing protocols, safety benchmarks, and certification processes for AI-powered
mobility systems.
3.Create a Public-Private Urban Accessibility Data Consortium
Support data-sharing initiatives that leverage insights from AI-assisted navigation
systems to identify infrastructure gaps and inform inclusive urban planning,
transportation design, and emergency preparedness strategies.
4.Offer Tax Incentives and Grants for Accessible AI Product Development
Provide financial support for companies and research groups developing
affordable, non-intrusive AI mobility solutions and subsidize the cost of these
devices for end users.
5.Invest in AI Accessibility Workforce Development
Fund education and training programs that empower people with disabilities to
engage with AI technologies as users, testers, and developers, promoting greater
3 


inclusion in the AI workforce.  
 
Conclusion  
AI-powered assistive technologies hold immense potential to improve the lives of 
Americans with disabilities, foster inclusive communities, and deliver broader societal 
and economic benefits. However, realizing this potential requires targeted government 
support, robust safety standards, and multi-stakeholder collaboration . We urge the 
OSTP and NITRD NCO to incorporate these recommendations into the AI Action Plan 
to ensure AI innovation is inclusive, equitable, and beneficial to all Americans.
