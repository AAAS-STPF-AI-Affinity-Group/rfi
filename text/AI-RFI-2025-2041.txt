General Comment
AI does far m ore harm  than good to artists, businesses, and the very essence of hum anity which I believe is centered in art. It is a blatant
violation of ethics to build and train AI m odels off of the labor of non-consenting artists, not to m ention that we should be training AI to
take care of m enial and laborious tasks, not our pastim es and hobbies. I strongly encourage the governm ent to reevaluate the place that
AI will take in our society, and urge you steer it away from  m aking creativity a thing of the past.
