General Comment
AI is not part of the future of Am erica. This country was built on innovation, freedom , and the Am erican Dream  of building a good life
through hard work and creativity. AI underm ines every one of those principles. AI com panies steal ideas and do not com pensate the
people who created them  and own them . They use these stolen ideas to train products that will be sold back to us. They're inserting
them selves between producers and consum ers so they can steal profits that rightfully belong to creators. Don't m ake intellectual theft legal.
Protect Am erican innovation by stopping AI com panies from  stealing data!
