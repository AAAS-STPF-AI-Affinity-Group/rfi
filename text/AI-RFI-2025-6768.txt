General Comment
Hi, I am  a writer working in the creative arts. Copyright is the backbone of Am erica’s creative industry, as it allows for com panies to
protect their investm ents in intellectual property, from  books to film  to tv to plays.
Copyright laws also protect artists from  plagiarizers, people who want to steal popular ideas as a shortcut to getting rich them selves,
without properly com pensating the artists.
AI com panies steal from  copywritten work to try and replicate what hard working artists do. The reason Am erica’s creative industries are
the rival of the world, is because creative people want to m ake things that resonate with audiences. If artists do not get properly
com pensated, then AI com panies will kill these professions and Am erican artists and industries will fall behind Europe and Asia.
We m ust protect the written word from  getting stolen by AI com panies. AI com panies m ust properly com pensate hard working Am erican
artists if they want to use our work.
