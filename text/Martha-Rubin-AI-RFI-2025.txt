I believe the American public would benefit from increased regulations on private sector AI 
innovation. Reducing regulations for private companies further lines the pockets of individuals 
who already hold too much wealth, at the expense of everyday people.  This hyperfixation on AI 
is out of touch and truly wasteful. Instead, the federal government should be focusing on 
strengthening our communications and transportation infrastructure. There are dozens of other 
areas this funding could be applied which woul d help more of our citizens. But clearly, that is 
not what this administration aims to do.
