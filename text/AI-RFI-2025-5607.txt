General Comment
This is an absolutely unacceptable thing. As an academ ic, I believe, our books, articles, artistic expressions are intellectual products that
were produced with years of research, labour, and intellectual work. The IA com panies should not have such confiscation for free. Our
governm ent should support the real producers of the knowledge not the IA com panies that grabs our products without any labour or
work.
