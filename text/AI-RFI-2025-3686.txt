General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erican citizens. It is a dangerous way to create any reality the user wishes and can
place Am ericans in com prom ising situations, positions, or have them  saying things that they never did. This can destroy livelihoods and
jobs if people have no way to know what is AI and what is reality.
