Sunday, March 2, 2025 9:34:03 AM
Global Competition and the U.S. Imperative
In the current global race:
- China is aggressively pursuing AI research, military applications, and efficient data center
buildouts—even under resource constraints—posing a direct challenge to U.S. dominance.- The European Union is setting global benchmarks for ethical and privacy-centric AI, whileother regions like the UK, Canada, and India leverage unique strengths in research andapplication.
Priority Actions for Sustaining U.S. AI Leadership
1. Accelerated Investment in AI R&D and Infrastructure
   Massive R&D Funding:Increase federal funding and incentivize public-private
partnerships to drive breakthrough innovations.  
   Computing and Data Infrastructure: Expand access to high-performance computing
resources and support the buildout of large-scale data centers—a point David Sacks
underscores as critical for competing globally.
2. Talent Development and Ecosystem Expansion
 STEM and AI Education: Enhance education and upskilling programs focused on AI,
machine learning, and quantum computing.  
 Attract Global Talent: Reform visa programs to draw top AI researchers, ensuring that
America remains the magnet for global innovation.
3. National Security and Defense Applications
 AI-Enabled Defense: Prioritize AI integration in cybersecurity, intelligence analysis,
and autonomous systems to bolster national security.  
 Ethical Oversight in Military AI: Establish clear, ethical guidelines for AI in defense—
balancing Musk’s drive for innovation with prudent risk management.
4. Responsible and Unburdened Innovation
 Deregulation of Stifling Policies: Identify and repeal or amend existing AI regulations
that unnecessarily hinder innovation. The US framework should promote transparency,factual integrity, and technical merit. 
 
 Industry-Led Safety Standards: Encourage collaboration with industry leaders to
develop practical, risk-based safety standards without imposing burdensome compliance
that slows progress.


5. Strategic Global Alliances and Leadership
   International Partnerships: Lead alliances with democratic nations to shape global AI
governance and safeguard against adversarial practices, particularly from nations like
China.  
   Diplomatic Engagement: Use diplomatic channels to set global norms that favor open
innovation and protect intellectual property rights.
Conclusion
The path forward for American AI leadership requires bold, decisive action that reflects the
dual nature of AI—its vast promise and its inherent risks.   The US should focus on  building
an AI ecosystem that is both transformational and resilient. The AI Action Plan should focuson fostering innovation, investing in critical infrastructure, developing talent, and ensuringsecure deployment. In doing so, the U.S. will not only sustain its global dominance but alsoshape the future of technology for the betterment of society.
We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this critical initiative and look forward to
collaborating further on these policy challenges.
