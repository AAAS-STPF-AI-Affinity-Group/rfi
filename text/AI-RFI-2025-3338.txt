General Comment
AI Steals m y livelihood as an Am erican. OpenAI should not be im m une to steal and profit off of hard working artists and creators. This is
copyright infringem ent. AI Should not be a subject of "national security", it's not reliable, and it's unethical. If these regulations are passed,
m any individuals will no longer have the freedom  to protect their work from  theft and people looking to exploit for profit and that is Anti-
Am erican.
