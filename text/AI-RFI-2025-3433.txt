General Comment
I strongly urge the OSTP and NITRD NCO to utilize strong copyright protections in any AI Action Plan. Modern AI system s, such as
OpenAI, are built upon the theft of both independent and corporate m edia to build their m odels. The m edia is scraped from  various
websites and social m edia without consent or com pensation to the creators. Any AI Action Plan that does not respect the copyright or
intellectual property rights of Am ericans has no place in this country.
