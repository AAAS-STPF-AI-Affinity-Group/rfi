General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is a danger to the environm ent with its resource requirem ents, and it is a danger to the livelihood of all creators whose
work is stolen to feed to AI learning engines. Com panies running AI can NOT be allowed to steal content or use it in these harm ful ways
with im punity and it is unreasonable and dangerous to our livelihood as Am ericans to allow com panies the absolute freedom  to steal
content and use it as they please
