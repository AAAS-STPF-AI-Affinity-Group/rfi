Artificial intelligence is not something that the American government should be prioritizing. 
There is already plenty of evidence that the continued implementation of artificial intelligence in 
generative data, data collection, and data algorithms in consu mer-facing platforms exactly 
counters the goal of "continued U.S. AI leadership will promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security". There have been several security and data breaches, temporary job losses, and power grid concerns related to generative AI (genAI), not to mention the fact that it can be easily manipulated into misinformation. American dominance in technology is unparalleled, and we should set an example in excellence by not falling for the newest buzzword from Si licone Valley.
