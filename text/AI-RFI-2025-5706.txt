General Comment
We care deeply about intellectual property in this country, as we should. So it is only natural to extend its protection to artists and their
works. AI that steals and “learns” from  the hard work of artists does not protect the artists’ IP. In fact, it violates and endangers it.
Therefore, any AI that profits off the exploitation of artists m ust be severely lim ited, if not outright banned. This is the only way to protect
the integrity and IP of all artists throughout the nation.
