General Comment
This is an inconsolable action that will have catastrophic effects across the entire country, including our very own governm ent. Already
there is a flood of fabricated im ages and audio files created by AI already infecting every section of the internet. AI scam  calls are
m ounting. Fake im ages are replacing authentic ones, furthering the spread of m isinform ation. AI writing books and articles are filled with
flawed, sketchy, and outright incorrect inform ation that can cause serious harm  or death to people. Putting so m uch reliance in the hands
of AI will not further advance us as a country. It will destroy m ore sectors of industry and society. AI replacing the hum an workforce will
increase unem ploym ent and ultim ately lead to universal stagnation. It is a technology that is still rife will flaws that will only com pound them
if left unchecked to scrap every bit of inform ation it can. The num ber of violations in copyright and breech of NDAs will sky rocket. To
rem ove the lim its of this technology and allow it to run ram pant with no com pensation is an anathem a to everything to the ideals this
country stands for: that hard work should be rewarded and praised. Giving that freedom  up to a m achine that has no conscious and is only
a tool for thieves to profit is neither rational nor sane. And I can't help but question the integrity of som eone who would willfully open the
door to a thief and let them  take what they wished, if they too are also in kahoots.
