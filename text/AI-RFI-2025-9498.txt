General Comment
It is critical to protect the private intellectual property of our great Am erican authors and other creators from  the com m unist appropriation
of their work by greedy AI organizations. Am erica has long prided itself on the strong incentives it provides to individual Am erican artists
and creators through a powerful copyright system . Through these strong protections Am erican authors know that they m aintain their God-
given rights to earn an incom e from  their hard work and prevent anyone from  taking the fruits of their labor from  them . Rem oving the
protections upon the works of Am ericans in order to satisfy the greed of AI m egacorporations would represent a m assive loss in the
greatness of Am erica by destroying all incentive Am ericans have to create. Do not listen to the fear m ongering of proponents of AI: they
do not have Am erican interests at heart and seek to push their own leftist and com m unist agenda by destroying individuality and free
hum an expression by collectivizing all creative works and using them  to build tools to create a regim e of censorship. Say NO to greedy
AI, PROTECT AMERICAN COPYRIGHT and keep what m akes Am erica great in Am erica!
