General Comment
I absolutely do not believe AI has a place in the future of the U.S. As an artist, m y work is m y livelihood, and AI steals from  the livelihood
of both m yself and countless other artists and creators, profiting from  the theft. Copyright is m eant to protect hard working Am ericans and
AI would absolutely destroy the soul of creative pursuits as well as the lives of creatives. Do not allow AI to com m it this destructive m ass
theft.
