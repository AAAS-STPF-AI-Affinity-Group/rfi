General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to access and use legally copyrighted works to im prove their own products and increase their own financial gain,
while giving nothing in return, will be hugely dam aging to all artists and to copyright laws as we know them . Many people who create
original works do so to earn a living, to feed their fam ilies and to fuel our society. Without art created by hum ans, we are nothing - just
m achines. 
By allowing com panies and individuals to reap the benefits of peoples' originals works without proper licensing or financial com pensation
is wrong, cruel and frankly insane. I see no logical reason why this should be allowed. 
If AI com panies want to train their m odels on peoples' works they need to get perm ission, just like law and com m on sense clearly states.
