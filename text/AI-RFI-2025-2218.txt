General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica. The current process of utilizing AI is harm ful to creatives and unless there are
restrictions placed on AI in how it is trained, then it is m ore detrim ental than helpful. Som e AI is beneficial in certain areas, such as
pattern-m atching, but is otherwise lim iting and harm ful, as inform ation it can process or create is often inaccurate.
