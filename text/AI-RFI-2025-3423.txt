General Comment
You would elim inate copyright, finish off the shaky system  barely holding together any work on the Internet as owned, just so AI m ay
continue to steal anything with no consequences? I'm  not AI's biggest enem y, but anything gained by rem oving all guardrails will be both
useless and should be crim inal. If they want our data, they can pay us for it or they can m ake their own.
