General Comment
I think every m ajor AI dataset should be investigated and prosecuted for individual instance of copyright infringem ent, personal privacy
violation, and perjury about the source of their stolen m aterials. 
Then I think we should shut down their server farm s com pletely, as they will have no ability to financially or judicially repair the dam ages
they have caused.
