General Comment
AI is often a speculative investm ent, sucking up m oney, energy, hum an ingenuity, and m ore resources for the speculation that it m ay be
able to solve certain problem s one day. AI is already running ram pant in our m arkets. The AI bubble can burst any m om ent and take
401ks and m utual funds with it. It has already been revealed that m any hailed “AI successes” are m erely powered by low-paid, overseas
em ployees working behind the scene to act as the AI or to label the data.
Further, AI needs guardrails to not be able to abuse the labor of m illions of artists, authors, and creators of all kinds. We need to be able
to control our own copyrighted m aterials.
