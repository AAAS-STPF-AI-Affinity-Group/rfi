General Comment
Chasing the AI hype honestly seem s like another wasteful use of taxpayer dollars and governm ent resources, since the only current use of
generative AI is to scrape from  existing (usually copyrighted) m aterial and generate output using that m aterial as a basis. It does not have a
place anywhere near the arts, as it will inevitably run up against legal troubles when copyright holders realize that generated m aterial has
been trained on their original works, and additionally this is going to discourage artists of all types (visual, m usical, theatrical, etc) from
producing art in the United States. Hollywood has been a great cultural force in the world, and encouraging the use of generative AI m ay
stifle Hollywood creativity and leave a vacuum  for other countries to fill. Do not waste any m ore governm ent resources on chasing the
generative AI bubble, and better yet find som e way to regulate it.
