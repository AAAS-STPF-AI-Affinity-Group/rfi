General Comment
So-called AI (LLMs) is only useful in a sm all array of use cases, such as cancer detection.
I do not support the AI Action plan for the following reasons:
- Generative AI does not provide accurate inform ation but instead guesses based on prior inform ation and pattern m atching. There is no
guarantee the inform ation provided by these LLMs can be safely acted upon.
- Generative AI is shown to reduce hum an critical thought.
- Generative AI uses prohibitive resources, specifically electricity and water to power and cool data centers as well as burns through
CPUs and hard drives. It also requires hum an labor to check and correct its output.
- Generative AI such as OpenAI is only successful because it is trained on stolen data aka the creative work of thousands if not m illions of
artists, writers, and program m ers. It is theft and its continued use im pacts m e as a program m er and writer. It threatens m y livelihood while
providing an inferior product.
