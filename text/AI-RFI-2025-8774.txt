General Comment
It is im perative for Am erica's future that we do not allow so-called "AI" to encroach upon the cultural creative power that m akes Am erica
such a rich nation. To endorse or even so m uch as indulge this technology is to engage in theft of the highest order from  Am erica's own
citizens, to steal from  our own coffers to chase a fleeting bubble. The AI bubble is already close to bursting, and if we allow it to grow
further, it will be all the m ore devastating when it finally pops. The push from  AI com panies to access copyrighted m aterials is a desperate,
last-ditch effort to wring a few m ore dollars out of the stock price before they cash out. They are m aking fools out of you and lining their
pockets. This is the dot-com  crash, but potentially even m ore dangerous and significantly m ore m alicious. 
Do the right thing. Shut it down now.
