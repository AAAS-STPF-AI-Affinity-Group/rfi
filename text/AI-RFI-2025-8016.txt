General Comment
I do not, under ANY circum stance, believe AI holds a place in the future of the US as it steals from  the livelihood of artists, entertainers
and workers not only here in Am erica, but everywhere as a result of it's uprising. It cannot be fully trusted as it profits off of theft,
leveraging the idea to replace skilled labor and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public at large.
It's a dead end technology at the end of it's "hype cycle", for all intents and purposes. Com panies and investors are throwing m oney at this
tool hoping to stum ble onto a way to m ake m oney have yet to succeed thus far and new m odels show that building bigger m odels yields
fewer and fewer returns. It's all no m ore than a 'speculative m arket' ready to pop. Not to dissim ilar to the likes of NFTs and
Cryptocurrency; built prim arily on false prom ises to fool the public and creates even bigger legal problem s by enabling those who fall for
it.
Not to m ention huge data security concerns should these tools fall into the wrong com pany's hands.
