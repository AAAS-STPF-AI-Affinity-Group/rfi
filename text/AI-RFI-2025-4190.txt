General Comment
OpenAI lacks any legal standing to scrape and steal copyrighted works off the internet without any form  of contract with the creators that
includes fair com pensation for the work. Beyond that, it has been legally upheld that AI-generated products can NOT be copyrighted
them selves. Therefore, by allowing OpenAI to steal from  the hard working creators AND m ajor corporations like Disney and Nintendo,
OpenAI open them selves up to a world of hurt in the form  of lawsuits.
Unless OpenAI intends to m ake their data sets 'Opt-in' and plan to FAIRLY pay creators for adding their works to their datasets, what
OpenAI plans to do is illegal under the usage of copyright.
