General Comment
Keep protections in place for the Arts. I assure you, there are m ore efficient ways to train an AI than allowing it to steal from  creatives.
It's wasteful of resources to give all AI free reign, and would ultim ately not payback as m uch as it costs if anyone could train AI off fiction
freely.
