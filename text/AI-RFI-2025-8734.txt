General Comment
I’m  an independent freelance storyboard artist, doing m y best to earn a living and develop shows and stories to hopefully inspire others
while m aking them  laugh at difficult issues. Can’t very well do that and keep paying the m onthly interest rate of $500 on m y student loans
if m y very existence is copied off of and stolen by anyone with an AI program . 
Good luck with your work shift though. Sorry you have to deal with this ordeal.
