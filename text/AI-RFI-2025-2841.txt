General Comment
We do not need this breaking further rules and laws to the act of Copyright Infringem ent.
This just gives it easy grabbing to steal from  people that go to school for art,work their life to build up a art prowess and nam e for
them selves.
This is not fair and a blatant disregard for the laws of art creation in all the aspects for which m ankind created with Art.
