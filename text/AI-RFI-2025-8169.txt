General Comment
The fact that a legal entity is excused from  violating regulations that were put in place to protect one of the m ain reasons why the United
States of Am erica is the wealthiest, and m ost prosperous country in the history of the world (the Copyright Act of 1976) is extrem ely
counter-intuitive and is fundam entally anti-Am erican. 
One of the biggest reasons art and the ability to profit off creative work is thanks to this act and protection. Now, this thing that we're
talking about here will, as previously m entioned will effectively pardon the violation of every writer, every Hollywood film  anim ator,
journalist, author, and digital artist's rights.
If you really wanted to, you could rip copyrighted work from  the hands of artists alike- all through these AI tools- effectively filtering out
legal various consequences.
There are other m ore beneficial ways to have inform ation to feed an AI m odel, too. Ladies and gentlem en, it's called asking for
perm ission. If perm ission is granted, and both parties agree, then the people licensing work is supported, and both parties have a
wonderful day.
This is not fair use. This is a direct attack on the livelihoods of all artists alike.
