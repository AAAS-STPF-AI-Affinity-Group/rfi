General Comment
The ram pant m isuse of artificial intelligence in practices like "AI generative art" violate any sense of ownership that the creators of the past,
today, and the foreseeable future deserve to keep. As the country responsible for the m ost m edia output on earth, it's disgusting to think of
the ways that creations that m illions have invested their tim e, effort, and affection into are being stolen and functionally destroyed. Any
com pany responsible for these generative AI tools should at the very least be required to pay for the rights to utilize the assets they've
otherwise been stealing.
