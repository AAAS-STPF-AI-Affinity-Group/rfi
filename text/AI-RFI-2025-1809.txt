General Comment
Hello
Allowing AI com panies to "train" on existing copywritten works to regurgitate these as products which can be sold by com panies without
paying the original creators is theft.
Do not legalize theft because the technology is new.
This will devastate the creative econom y, harm ing m illions who serve these artists and fundam entally m ake Am erica weaker.
Do not let Am erica get weaker or lose what has m ade it the cultural capitol of the world for one hundred years.
