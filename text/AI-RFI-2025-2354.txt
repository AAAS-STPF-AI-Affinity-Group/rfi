General Comment
This prom otion/protection of AI technology is a sm okescreen to cover blatant theft of works created by others in order to generate wealth
for people who do not, and have never, created anything worthwhile on their own. AI offers no benefit to hum anity as a whole, and does
irreversible environm ental dam age to a world already being allowed to burn over shortsighted m onetary gains.
AI is currently "trained" using stolen work created by actual artists, who are already not properly com pensated for their work, so that
husks of corporate m alfeasance can add one m ore zero to their earnings report at the expense of everything else.
Do not choose AI and rem oval of oversight on technology com panies over the people who actually provide hum anity with som ething
besides m oney and ego.
