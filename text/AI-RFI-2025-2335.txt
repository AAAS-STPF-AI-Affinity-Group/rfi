General Comment
Hello, I am  a concerned US citizen. 
This law that OpenAI and Google is trying to push is extrem ely harm ful and will destroy the lives of thousands to m illions. This will crash a
plethora of creative econom ies and lead us to a world that strays from  hum anity, creativity, and ideas, into a world that is only built against
us. 
Creative copyright gives people a chance to explore, express them selves, and earn a living creating by being able to identify unique
creations that they m ake. This allows people to get started in entertainm ent m edium s, that are detrim ental to hum anity’s continuation, and
not fear that their work is going to be plagiarized by a process they have no control over. AI generated content can never fill the hole that
will be left by this, hum an creativity is necessary for us to continue, and an artificial intelligence can never replicate a hum an work in a way
that feels, or is, hum an. They can not replicate the em otion, the understanding, and the com passion that goes into these works, and it is
very easy to tell as an enjoyer of these works that they don’t even begin to spark any positive em otion that entertainm ent and creative
m edium s have for centuries. 
So for the sake of all creatives and all people, please do not alter the current law in favor of what those operating artificial intelligence
want, they are only going to harm  all of hum anity by doing this.
