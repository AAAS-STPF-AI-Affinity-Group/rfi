General Comment
I believe generative AI is a dangerous tool for us. There are entirely too m any fake AI posts that go around scam m ing people, spreading
hate/false inform ation, etc. Not to m ention it com pletely steals from  actual hum an artists, and exploits their work without their knowledge.
Com panies are firing hum ans, people are losing their jobs, because of AI.
If you care about the people of this country, you would ban AI.
