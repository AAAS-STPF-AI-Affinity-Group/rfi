General Comment
My nam e is Anthony and I believe this is an egregious violation of creative rights, not to m ention how these program s erode education
quality by providing theft and plagiarism  opportunities. This will negatively im pact all aspects of our entertainm ent, stripping the soul,
creativity and Am erican Spirit out of any creation be it art, m usic, television or m ovies. Open AI m ust not have creative protections.
Generative AI is extrem ely harm ful not to m ention extrem ely unappealing.
