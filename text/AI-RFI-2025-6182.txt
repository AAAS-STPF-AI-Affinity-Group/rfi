General Comment
Ai tools are generally a m assive waste of power and resources. They are inefficient, often riddled with lies and falsified inform ation, and
public facing tools like LLMs and 'art' program s actively steal from  public hum an works to function. These tools have no m aterial value
and actively dim inish the hum an practice and experience in areas where these program s are applied often.
AI com panies are seeking to have all regulation rem oved so they can actively scrape and steal for their own benefit, NOT the Am erican
peoples. Only corporations benefit here and all others are actively harm ed, especially artists, writers, and those that produce creative
works in the public eye.
