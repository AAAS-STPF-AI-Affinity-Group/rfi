General Comment
AI that is built off the work of uncom pensated, uncredited individuals is antithetical to the entire system  of capitalism . If workers are given
no due reward or recognition for their efforts, what reasons will we have to encourage participation in the workforce? Or to continue
creating new works at all? Allowing OpenAI or any other AI platform  to rip the intellectual property out of the hands of the working class
without perm ission, without com pensation, should be com pletely illegal. It is theft, plain and sim ple, and should be prosecutable under
Am erican copyright law.
OpenAI and sim ilar platform s only exist due to the works created by HUMANS, not m achines! And if hum ans - nay, AMERICAN
CITIZENS, are not given their proper respect for their skills and efforts, for what reason will anyone desire to continue creating? New
works will grow stagnant, and AI will seal its own downfall with no new fodder to continue learning & growing from . Not only is this
unfair to the Am erican creative workforce, it will seal AI's own fate and doom  it to an endless feedback loop without new sources of
creative inform ation to change and evolve from . The only true path forward is cooperation and collaboration that actually honors the
labors of Am erican artisans and respects their legal copyrights, and their right to deny service to AI com panies.
