General Comment
Hello. I am  m aking this com m ent from  the perspective of a concerned Am erican citizen reading this plan for AI developm ent.
I do not agree with this course. AI, as currently deployed by applications like ChatGPT and others do not have a place in Am erica's
future. Artificial intelligence technology is not reliable enough and poses an existential threat to hum an creativity and ingenuity and should
not have a place in any official operations of the United States. 
The guardrails and obstacles to developm ent exist to prevent unchecked com panies from  stealing swathes of data, artwork, and
knowledge from  m illions of Am ericans. Artists of all kinds have their livelihoods threatened by the developm ent of AI. The job m arket is
falling apart as potential em ployees are rejected from  online applications by algorithm s and AI. 
Artificial intelligence threatens our education as inform ation once easily accessible on the internet is hidden away by corporations
attem pting to "Wow!" Am ericans with AI sum m aries. Children in our schools are passing with answers m ade by ChatGPT and m issing
entire years worth of developm ent and education. 
Please, I im plore our leadership to change course and m ove Am erica away from  allowing AI to direct or inform  our actions in anyway. 
Sincerely,
-A concerned United States Citizen.
