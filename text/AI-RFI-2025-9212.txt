General Comment
Please do not go through with this, I absolutely don't approve of m aking AI stuff fair use, and I doubt your corporate friends would like
that either! My artist and m usician friends absolutely wouldn't appreciate being undercut by som e talentless suits even further, and with
governm ent approval at that. If you want to extinguish artistic sustainability even faster, be m y guest, I know this regim e is hellbent on
killing everything norm al people care about, but I will fight tooth and nail to m ake sure that doesn't happen, and I hope you take this into
consideration, even if you throw this com m ent into the trash.
