Executive Summary 
This AI Action Plan, America 2.0: Mission T.47, outlines a comprehensive approach to 
build a robust AI ecosystem through talent development, leadership renewal in key 
industries, strategic public-private investments, accelerated commercialization, 
and partnerships across sectors and borders. Key recommendations include: 
●Building a Collaborative AI Ecosystem:  Establish Collaborative Innovation
Hubs (CIHs) that unite stakeholders for innovation and strategic partnerships,
ensuring AI solutions address national challenges in security, infrastructure, and
the economy.
●Driving AI-Based Economic Transformation: Leverage AI to re-industrialize
America,  transforming manufacturing, optimizing supply chains, and
modernizing infrastructure. Specialized centers within CIHs will focus on
financial optimization, operational excellence, sustainable innovation, R&D, and
commercialization to ensure AI innovations translate into broad economic
benefits.●Facilitating Generational Leadership Transition: Address the imminent
leadership gap as baby-boomer business owners retire in national security,
critical industries. Implement mentorship programs, leadership training, and
innovative ownership transfer models to preserve intellectual capital andsmoothly transition enterprises to a new generation of operators (Small business
survival in the wake of the silver tsunami).
●Developing the AI Workforce: Launch a national AI workforce development
initiative to equip American workers. This includes AI education at all levels,
industry-recognized certification programs, incentives for employer-led training,
and targeted re-skilling programs (especially for veterans and displaced
Page 1 of 15 


workers). AI investment is surging to $550 billion while an estimated 50% talent 
gap in AI looms (AI Skills Gap | IBM). 
●Mobilizing Public-Private Investment: Create an AI-focused public-private
investment arm that blends government resources with private sector agility.
Aligned incentives and innovative financing (e.g. venture capital, private equity,
and infrastructure funds) will accelerate scaling of AI solutions in defense,
energy, and other critical sectors. All stakeholders, government, industry,
academia, should have ownership stakes in outcomes, ensuring shared
commitment to success.●Forging Strategic Partnerships: Strengthen partnerships both domestically
and internationally . Domestically, foster cross-sector collaborations and
consortia to break down silos between government labs, universities, and
companies. Internationally, coordinate with allies on AI research, standards, and
commercialization.
Government, policymakers and industry leaders must act decisively on these 
recommendations. It must “invest substantially more resources in AI innovation to 
protect its security, promote its prosperity and safeguard the future of democracy” 
(NSCAI Report: US Can Gain Leading Edge on AI With This Plan | GovCIO Media & 
Research ). The following sections provide detailed proposals and actions under each 
strategic theme. 
Introduction and Context 
The Imperative for an AI Action Plan: Artificial Intelligence has started to revolutionize 
and threaten industries, national security, and societies. The U.S. federal government 
and private sector have launched numerous AI initiatives, but efforts remain fragmented 
across agencies and regions. To maintain U.S. leadership a coordinated strategy must 
unite stakeholders, focus investments, and guide AI development in line with national 
priorities. 
America 2.0, Mission T.47: This AI Action Plan presents a comprehensive strategy for 
AI-driven innovation, national security, and economic transformation. The plan centers 
on leveraging existing government infrastructure, such as the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, Manufacturing 
Extension Partnerships (MEPs), and Economic Development Administration (EDA) 
networks, to create a collaborative AI ecosystem .  
Objectives: This proposal aligns with the White House Office of Science and 
Technology Policy (OSTP) vision for a National AI Strategy. It aims to: Page 2 of 15 


1.Integrate AI Technologies Nationwide: Promote integrating AI solutions in
national security operations, economic infrastructure, and workforce to enhance
productivity and resilience.
2.Foster Public-Private Collaboration:  Build sustainable public-private
partnerships and ecosystems that keep the U.S. at the forefront of AI innovation.
This includes co-investment models and sharing of expertise between
government, industry, and capital/investors.3.Bridge the Generational Leadership Gap: Tackle the urgent challenge of a
retiring generation of business owners by preserving their expertise and pairing
them with emerging leaders. This ensures continuity of operations and
knowledge in industries vital to national security and economic stability.
4.Empower Ethical and Secure AI Adoption:  Encourage AI deployment in ways
that uphold ethical standards, protect privacy, and ensure security.
Considerations of safety and democratic values should accompany every
innovation.
The following sections articulate five key themes of the plan, each corresponding to a 
strategic pillar of action. These themes echo national priorities and mirror elements 
highlighted in the OSTP’s AI Action Plan development process. 
A.Creating a Collaborative AI Ecosystem and Strategic
Partnerships
Collaborative Innovation Hubs (CIHs): We propose establishing Collaborative 
Innovation Hubs as regional focal points of AI activity. CIHs will unite government 
agencies, private industry, academic institutions, and investors into consortia focused 
on AI innovation. Each hub addresses regional challenges (e.g., a Rust Belt CIH 
focusing on manufacturing and a Silicon Prairie CIH on agriculture) while contributing to 
national AI objectives. By leveraging and evolving existing entities like EDA offices, 
MEP centers, and NIST institutes, the CIHs will transform these organizations into 
active enablers of AI-driven ecosystems.  
Key Functions of CIHs: Each Collaborative Innovation Hub will perform critical 
functions to build the AI ecosystem: ●Research and Development (R&D):  Provide collaboration to identify common
problems in industrial and infrastructure sectors to enable knowledge transfer,
R&D, and co-innovation. Federally funded research can be paired with
industry-led development to accelerate progress from concept to prototype.
Page 3 of 15 


●Public-Private Partnerships (Cross-Sector Collaboration): Serve as a nexus
for partnerships among government, private companies (from startups to large
firms), universities, and non-profits. These partnerships will be structured to align
commercialization and its financing. This reduces the “valley of death” for
promising AI innovations and speeds up the time from R&D to deployment.  (This
strategy echoes the National AI R&D Strategic Plan’s call to “expand public- 
private partnerships to accelerate advances in AI”.)●Commercialization Support: Create pathways to transition AI technologies from
labs to the marketplace. Each hub will have partnerships to help innovators
navigate technical validation, regulatory compliance, intellectual property (IP)
protection, and other hurdles to bring AI products to market.●Workforce Development: Partner with educational institutions and employers to
build regional AI talent pipelines and hands-on training leadership programs. By
upskilling and reskilling the local workforce, hubs pair the human capital needed
to maintain these companies and implement technologies.
Strategic Partnerships Beyond CIHs: In addition to the regional hubs, a broader 
framework of partnerships is crucial. This includes: 
●Interstate and Interagency Collaboration: CIHs in different states will
coordinate with each other and with federal agencies (e.g. Department of
Defense, Department of Energy) to share best practices and avoid duplication.●Industry Consortia: Encourage the formation of industry-specific AI consortia
(for example, an AI in healthcare consortium or an AI in agriculture consortium)
that bring competitors together pre-competitively to set standards and pool
resources.●International Allies and Partnerships: The U.S. should deepen AI cooperation
with allies and partners globally. This includes collaborative research initiatives,
talent exchange programs, common standards for trustworthy AI, and
commercialization.
By weaving together regional hubs, national consortia, and international collaborations, 
the United States can create a dense web of strategic partnerships.  
B.AI-Driven Economic Transformation and
Commercialization
We propose targeted initiatives for economic transformation and commercialization of 
AI innovations  for re-industrializing America through specialized centers and 
programs integrated within the Collaborative Innovation Hubs. 
Page 4 of 15 


Centers for Economic Transformation will provide expertise and resources to help 
industrial companies improve their efficiency and strength for growth and innovation. 
The proposed centers include: 
●Financial Optimization Center (FOC): Helps businesses strengthen their
financial resilience and leverage all available incentives for AI adoption. This
center will guide companies in utilizing grants, tax credits, and innovative
financing to fund AI projects. It also offers advisory on managing intellectual
capital and evaluating M&A or investment opportunities. The FOC fills a gap not
covered by existing programs, ensuring companies can afford AI transformation
and measure the full value (including intangible assets) that AI brings.●Operational Excellence Center (OEC): Drives efficiency improvements through
AI-driven automation, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. The
OEC assists firms to deploy AI solutions that reduce downtime, save energy,
minimize waste, and improve output quality. AI tools can significantly enhance
productivity where traditional consulting falls short.●Sustainable Innovation Center (SIC): Focuses on technology and intellectual
capital and intellectual property solutions for sustainability and deep tech
innovation. It supports companies in reducing environmental impact (e.g.
optimizing energy consumption, cutting waste) while capitalizing on sustainable
finance  opportunities. The SIC will help firms navigate environmental regulations,
adopt clean technologies, and tap into green subsidies or markets. By aligning
innovation with sustainable development goals, this center ensures economic
transformation is environmentally responsible and future-proof.●Research and Development Center (RDC):  Concentrates on problem-driven
R&D by identifying pressing industry challenges and matching them with AI
innovators (startups, inventors, research labs). The RDC’s process is: (1) Work
with industry partners to pinpoint high-impact problems impeding economic,
operational, financing, or security progress. (2) Scout or incubate AI solutions by
partnering with entrepreneurs and researchers. (3) Support the development
process with technical expertise, mentorship, and feasibility assessments. The
RDC ensures that R&D is closely aligned with market needs and that promising
ideas have a viable path to commercialization through early-stage funding and
access to testbeds.●Commercialization and Market Expansion Center (CMEC): Dedicated to
bringing AI solutions to market at scale. The CMEC works on go-to-market
strategy, helping AI innovations developed in the CIH (from the RDC or
elsewhere) reach real customers and achieve sustainable growth.
By establishing these targeted centers from financial planning to technical R&D to 
commercialization, businesses, especially small and mid-sized ones, will have access to 
Page 5 of 15 


end-to-end support to identify areas of opportunity and address them for a solid 
focundation to then implement the entire value chain: innovation, validation, production, 
and diffusion of AI technology. 
C.  Generational Leadership Transition in Critical 
Industries 
A less-discussed but urgent challenge in maintaining America’s industrial and 
technological leadership is the coming wave of retirements  among business owners 
and experts of the baby boomer generation. In the next decade, a large proportion of 
owners of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), many in sectors crucial to 
national security and economic stability, intend to retire. Yet, the majority lack concrete 
succession plans (NSCAI Report: US Can Gain Leading Edge on AI With This Plan | 
GovCIO Media & Research ) (Small business survival in the wake of the silver tsunami). 
This looming “silver tsunami” of retiring leadership puts at risk vast amounts of 
intellectual capital (IC), the knowledge, skills, and networks that these leaders carry. If 
their businesses collapse or are sold off without continuity, it could erode the industrial 
base in manufacturing, defense contracting, energy, and other areas vital to national 
interests. 
The Urgency of Bridging the Leadership Gap: Over 10,000 baby boomers reach 
retirement age every day (Small business survival in the wake of the silver tsunami). By 
2030, the entire boomer generation will be at or past retirement age, and 40% of U.S. 
small business owners are in this cohort (Small business survival in the wake of the 
silver tsunami). Reports estimate less than one-third of small business owners have a 
formal exit or succession plan (Small business survival in the wake of the silver 
tsunami). In other words, tens of thousands of firms — representing millions of jobs and 
significant economic output — may face leadership crises. In national security-related 
sectors (like precision manufacturing for defense, or critical infrastructure services), the 
stakes are even higher. If these businesses fail to transition, the U.S. could lose 
domestic capacity in areas where it cannot afford to be dependent on foreign supply. 
Therefore, strategic intervention is needed to preserve these businesses, retain their 
know-how, and mentor new leadership to take the helm. 
Strategies for Generational Transition: This Action Plan proposes several strategies 
to facilitate successful leadership transitions in critical industries: 
1. Mentorship and Advisory Roles for Retiring Owners: Establish formal 
knowledge and industry relationships transferring programs. Apprenticeship 
programs pairing retiring business owners with the next generation of leaders.  
Page 6 of 15 


 Actionable Step: Create a National Apprenticeship Network for succession, 
possibly funded or incentivized by the Small Business Administration or EDA. 
Retiring leaders can receive stipends or tax benefits for participating, recognizing 
their role in sustaining the industry's intellectual capital. 
2.Turnaround Experts and Leadership Certification: Develop a certification for
turnaround experts, individuals trained to take over and revitalize established
businesses.
Actionable Step: Launch a Transitioning  Leadership Academy  with tracks for
financial planners, consultants, business owners, and executive employers
offering certifications in business restructuring, financial optimization, and
operations.
3.Gradual Ownership Transition Models: Promote equity-sharing and phased
transfer  models to avoid abrupt leadership handovers. Structures such as
employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) or management buyouts with
mentorship can be utilized.
Actionable Step: Encourage Seller  Financing  and Earn-outs, where retiring
owners remain financially invested during the transition. The government can
facilitate this by providing guarantees or tax incentives for installment sales of
businesses to approved successors. Additionally, craft template partnership
agreements that outline shared decision-making between the outgoing and
incoming owners during a transition phase (e.g., 3-5 years), with clear milestones
for the successor to take over entirely. Similar to the standardized SAFE note for
Venture Capitalists. 4.Platforms to Match Owners and Successors:  Often, a retiring owner’s biggest
challenge is finding a trustworthy, capable person to take over. We recommend
creating online platforms and networks that connect retiring owners with
certified (by our recommended turnaround and leadership certifications) aspiring
business leaders and advisors interested in acquiring or running a company.
These platforms can function like marketplaces for business succession, but with
vetting and support mechanisms. Retiring owners could even invest alongside
the new owners, preserving some equity and incentive to help the business
succeed post-transition.Actionable Step: The Department of Commerce or SBA could sponsor a
Business Succession Exchange. In this secure portal, owners list opportunities
and qualified individuals (or teams) apply to take on those businesses. The
platform could integrate with mentorship and financing programs.5.Leveraging Veteran Leadership and Skills: Many military veterans have
technical skills, leadership experience, and mission-focused discipline that would
Page 7 of 15 


make them excellent leaders in industrial and tech companies. We propose 
targeting veterans as a talent pool to fill critical industry leadership gaps.  
Actionable Step: Implement Sponsored programs to certified and placed 
veterans in the apprenticeship programs with retiring business owners. 
Partnerships with veteran organizations and the Department of Defense’s 
SkillBridge program could facilitate internships or apprenticeships where 
veterans work alongside an outgoing business owner before fully taking over a 
role. Preserving and Developing Intellectual Capital: Underpinning all these strategies is 
the goal of preserving the invaluable intellectual capital in these businesses. Intellectual 
capital (IC) includes proprietary knowledge, trade secrets, skilled teams, and processes 
honed over decades. If not intentionally transferred or retained, IC can dissipate when 
an owner retires or a company is sold to an outsider who fails to appreciate its value. 
The U.S. cannot afford to lose the expertise in domains like defense manufacturing, 
aerospace engineering, or even local infrastructure services, as these are the engines 
of innovation and readiness. 
However, they are often underutilized even when programs exist to help with 
succession or knowledge transfer. Common challenges include: lack of awareness of 
assistance programs, bureaucracy and red tape that deter participation, financial 
constraints for new owners, misalignment of programs with industry needs, 
fragmentation of resources, and a focus by many firms on short-term survival over 
long-term planning. To address these barriers: ●Improve Awareness and Access:  Many SMB owners simply do not know about
available succession planning resources or find them too complex to navigate.
Simplified communication is needed. Solution:  The IRS must deliver awareness
and guidance to all accountants and tax professionals about the incentives to do
financial planning and a transition plan.●Financial Support and Risk Mitigation:  Transitioning a business can be
expensive (legal costs, training a successor, potential downtime) and risky.
Solution:  Provide financial incentives such as low-interest loans, loan
guarantees, or grants to facilitate critical sector leadership transitions. For
instance, a Business Transition Loan Program could help fund a successor’s
purchase of shares or investment in modernizing the firm during the handover.
Coupling this with tax breaks or assurance of government contract continuity can
reduce perceived risk.●Foster Collaborative Networks: Often, owners don’t transition because they
operate in silos without opportunities to partner or merge with others.

By implementing these measures, the U.S. can provide the mechanisms that 
facilitate the generational transition in key industries and avoid a significant loss of 
capacity and know-how. Instead, retiring pioneers will become mentors and investors in 
the new generation, and incoming leaders will be empowered to rejuvenate legacy 
companies with fresh ideas and AI-driven improvements.  
D. AI Workforce Development
Preparing the American workforce for an AI-driven economy is a cornerstone of this 
Action Plan. Without a skilled and adaptable workforce, even the most advanced AI 
innovations will fail to gain traction, and the benefits of AI could accrue to only a few 
while many are left behind. To prevent this, we need a strategic, multifaceted AI 
workforce development initiative that spans education, training, and policies to 
incentivize continuous learning. 
National AI Workforce Initiative: We recommend the launch of a National AI 
Workforce Initiative, a coordinated effort across government agencies (Department of 
Education, Department of Labor, NSF, etc.), industry partners, and educational 
institutions, to rapidly expand AI-related skills at all levels. This initiative would serve as 
an umbrella for programs and funding targeting AI skill gaps, similar in spirit to past 
national efforts in STEM education but focusing on AI and data literacy. Key 
components of this initiative include: ●Curriculum Integration: Integrate AI fundamentals into K-12 education and
post-secondary programs. This means introducing students to concepts of
algorithms, data analysis, and ethical implications of AI early on. High schools
could offer introductory AI and coding classes, while community colleges and
universities create or expand programs in data science, machine learning
engineering, and AI ethics. The aim is to produce a steady flow of graduates with
AI competencies and raise the general technological literacy of all students.●Industry-Recognized Certifications: Develop AI certification and training
programs for current workers, ensuring they are tailored to industry-specific
needs. Not every job requires a PhD in machine learning; many require a
practical understanding of using AI tools. By collaborating with industry, training
providers can create credentials in areas like “AI in Manufacturing Operations” or
“AI for IT Service Management”. These certifications would standardize the skill
sets and reassure employers of a candidate’s proficiency. The government can
encourage this by supporting standard-setting organizations or grants to
educational tech companies to develop courseware.●Broad Accessibility: Ensure training programs are accessible at all skill levels,
from basic AI literacy for non-technical workers to advanced AI specialization for
Page 9 of 15 


tech professionals. This could involve online courses, bootcamps, 
apprenticeships, and evening or part-time programs for working adults. 
Affordability is crucial: use public funding or public-private partnerships to 
subsidize tuition, especially for underrepresented groups. The goal is to 
democratize AI knowledge so that workers in any region or demographic can 
upgrade their skills. 
Incentives for Employer-Led Training: Employers should be key partners in 
workforce development. We propose strong incentives for companies to invest in 
upskilling their employees: ● Tax Incentives: Offer payroll tax reductions or credits to firms that provide 
approved AI training to their staff. For instance, if a manufacturing company 
retrains its assembly line workers to operate AI-augmented machinery or to 
perform data analysis, it could receive a tax credit offsetting part of the training 
cost. Additionally, expenses on employee AI education should be explicitly 
eligible for the R&D tax credit. Currently, U.S. tax law (Section 41 and related) 
credits R&D activities; expanding the definition to include workforce training 
for technology adoption  would encourage more investment in human capital. ● Grants and Public-Private Programs: The government can co-fund training 
programs in critical sectors. For example, through the Department of Labor or 
NSF, create grant programs that match employer contributions to training 
programs dollar-for-dollar in cybersecurity, AI-driven manufacturing, or healthcare 
AI. This de-risks the cost for companies, especially small businesses. ● Recognition and Procurement Preferences:  The government can reward 
companies that actively upskill workers by factoring it into federal contract 
awards. A contractor with a robust workforce development plan (including AI 
training) could be given preference or additional points in proposal evaluations, 
similar to how workforce diversity or past performance is valued. This leverages 
the federal government’s buying power to drive training investments. Alignment with Tax Policy (Section 174 Fix): Recent changes to U.S. tax code 
require R&D expenses to be amortized over years instead of deducted immediately, 
which can be a disincentive for innovation spending (Section 174: Understanding 
Research & Development expenditures ). We support efforts to simplify Section 174 of 
the IRS Code to allow Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to deduct 
AI-related R&D and training expenses immediately. Immediate expensing lowers the 
upfront cost of investing in new technology and skills. Policymakers should prioritize 
reversing or adjusting any provisions that unintentionally discourage companies from 
making R&D and training investments. (Notably, experts have observed that the shift to 
amortization in 2022 has correlated with a slowdown in R&D spending (R&D Expert: Page 10 of 15 


Capitalization, Amortization Requirement Hurts Smaller ). Swift legislative action on this 
front will remove a financial barrier to AI innovation.) 
Re-skilling and Inclusion Programs: As AI changes the nature of many jobs, workers 
whose tasks are automated or augmented need pathways to new roles. Targeted 
re-skilling initiatives should be launched for occupations most at risk of AI-driven 
disruption and for communities that might be left behind: 
●Veterans Transition to AI Careers:  Building on the idea from the leadership
section, many veterans have transferable skills for AI and tech (e.g., experience
with advanced systems, leadership). Expand programs (like DoD’s SkillBridge or
VA training programs) to include specific tracks for AI, cybersecurity, and data
analysis. Veterans could be fast-tracked into apprenticeships with industrial
companies, combining their discipline with new technical training.●Dislocated Worker Programs: For workers displaced from industries
undergoing automation (e.g., specific manufacturing or clerical jobs), provide
re-skilling scholarships and living stipends to enroll in AI or IT training courses.
The Economic Development Administration can work with states to use existing
dislocated worker funds or TAA (Trade Adjustment Assistance) for AI-related
retraining, acknowledging AI as a factor in job displacement similar to trade.●Inclusive Workforce Development: Ensure underrepresented groups (women,
minorities, rural communities) have equitable access to AI education. Support
organizations and community colleges in underserved areas to run AI training
bootcamps. Leverage libraries and public institutions to offer basic AI literacy
classes. This broadens the talent pool and helps reduce bias in AI systems by
involving a diverse range of people in their development and use.
Urgency and Current Gaps: The push for AI workforce development comes at a 
critical time. So far, only 14% of frontline employees have had any AI-related upskilling 
to date (Employers Train Employees to Close the AI Skills Gap). Meanwhile, demand 
for AI talent is skyrocketing: companies plan to spend billions on AI, but struggle to find 
qualified staff (AI Skills Gap | IBM). By aggressively  implementing the above 
measures, we can close the talent gap and ensure American workers are prepared for 
the jobs of the future. 
The National Security Commission on AI (National Security Commission on Artificial 
Intelligence (NSCAI) recommendations aling with this AI Action Plan’s workforce 
recommendations to build a strong pipeline of AI-proficient professionals. 
The next section turns to the equally important task of funding and investment 
mechanisms to support all these initiatives. 
Page 11 of 15 


E. Public-Private Investment and Financing for AI
Innovation 
Achieving the ambitious goals of this AI Action Plan will require substantial investment. 
Traditional government grants and private venture capital alone are insufficient, we must 
leverage public-private investment vehicles that combine the strengths of both 
sectors. By aligning incentives and co-investing in strategic areas, we can mobilize far 
more resources for AI deployment than either sector could alone, and ensure that 
results are rapidly scaled for national impact. 
Establish a Public-Private AI Investment Arm: We recommend the creation of an 
investment entity or program dedicated to funding AI technologies and infrastructure 
through public-private partnerships (PPPs). This could be a new 
government-sponsored enterprise, a joint fund, or an interagency program that 
coordinates with private investors. The core idea is to blend “the resources, speed, and 
innovation of the private sector with the strategic direction, funding, and regulatory 
support of the government.”  For example, consider a scenario where the government 
identifies a critical AI technology (say, AI for supply chain security), instead of only 
issuing grants, the PPP investment arm might create a fund where government money 
is matched with venture capital. Projects are selected jointly by public and private 
experts. This ensures both funding and private sector discipline (due diligence, speed) 
and public interest (security, broad benefit) are represented in projects. 
Key features of this investment arm would include: 
●Aligned Ownership and Incentives: All stakeholders (government agencies,
private investors, corporate partners, even universities) can hold equity or
ownership stakes in the ventures supported. This is a departure from typical
grantmaking, here, the government might take an equity stake or royalties in a
company it supports, aligning its interest with the product's success. Likewise, a
private investor co-invests knowing the government is a partner that will help
reduce regulatory barriers or act as a lead customer for the AI solution. When
everyone is a co-owner, each party is motivated to see the AI solution succeed in
the market, not just reach a prototype.
●Strategic Guidance and Coordination:  The government’s role is to provide
funds, target the investment to national priorities, and convene the right partners.
The investment arm would likely focus on areas with high national importance but
where market failures exist (e.g., AI for critical infrastructure protection, where
pure commercial ROI might be uncertain or longer-term). By declaring priority
areas, the program can attract relevant private partners. It can also streamline
regulatory processes for its projects (fast-track approvals, provide testing
Page 12 of 15 


sandboxes) and use government procurement as a demand signal. Essentially, 
government de-risks and validates the technology, making private investors more 
willing to commit capital. 
●Diverse Funding Sources: This model leverages alternative financing beyond
venture capital alone to build a sustainable investment ecosystem. Private equity,
infrastructure funds, corporate investment arms, and even philanthropic funds
can participate, each bringing different time horizons and risk appetites. For
instance, a private equity firm might invest in scaling up manufacturing for an AI
hardware startup, while a venture fund focuses on earlier-stage AI software
innovations. Combining these, the investment arm covers the entire spectrum
from research to deployment. Hedge funds or private credit could provide debt
financing to AI infrastructure projects (like data centers or broadband expansion
needed for AI services). A mix of funding ensures that a promising AI solution
can find support at every stage of its lifecycle, reducing the chances it falls into a
capital “valley of death.”Deployment and Global Collaboration:  In deploying public-private investment, the 
U.S. should harness international partnerships and alliances to amplify impact. The 
U.S. government should use its diplomatic and trade channels to encourage 
cross-border co-investment in AI initiatives, particularly cybersecurity and defense 
where allies face common threats. 
Specific actions to structure these investments include: 
●Domestic Investment Networks: Form Strategic Investor Alliances at the
national level. For example, create a consortium of U.S. venture capital and
private equity firms that commit to evaluating and potentially funding AI projects
sourced through the PPP program. This alliance could meet regularly with OSTP
or a designated AI authority to review a pipeline of opportunities (from CIHs or
federal labs) and fast-track the matchmaking of projects with capital. The
government can sweeten deals by offering matching funds or first-loss capital
(where the government absorbs initial losses, protecting private investors).
●International Co-Funding Agreements:  Negotiate agreements with allied
governments to co-fund AI research and startups. For instance, the U.S. and
Japan could each put $50 million into a joint fund focusing on AI for
semiconductor manufacturing, an area critical to both economies sharing costs
and resulting benefits. These partnerships tap into global expertise and markets,
ensuring U.S. innovations can scale globally with friendly markets from the start.
●Infrastructure for Scaling: Ensure that funding is available not just for software
or algorithms but also for the infrastructure and hardware needed to deploy AI
at scale. This includes semiconductor fabrication, cloud computing infrastructure,
Page 13 of 15 


test ranges for autonomous systems, and more. Public-private financing models 
(like those used for traditional infrastructure) can be applied, for example, using 
public funds to guarantee loans for building a cutting-edge AI supercomputing 
facility that multiple companies and agencies can use. 
●Regulatory and Policy Support: The investment arm should work with
regulators to create a conducive environment. Essentially, the government’s
non-monetary assets, convening power, regulatory flexibility, and role as a
customer are as important as the dollars invested, and should be systematically
applied to maximize the success of investments.
Through aggregated public-private efforts and allied cooperation, we can achieve a 
competitive scale of investment while staying true to our market-driven and 
values-driven approach. As noted earlier, the NSCAI urged substantial investment to 
keep the U.S. ahead in the global AI race (NSCAI Report: US Can Gain Leading Edge 
on AI With This Plan | GovCIO Media & Research ), public-private partnerships are a 
force multiplier to achieve that. 
Importantly, aligning incentives through co-ownership also guards against pitfalls: it 
discourages pure short-term profit motives from sacrificing national interest (since the 
government has a seat at the table) and ensures government-funded projects maintain 
commercial viability (since private investors demand it). In essence, it marries mission 
with market, it aligns purpose and capital. 
Conclusion and Next Steps 
This AI Action Plan provides a structured blueprint for the United States to strengthen its 
leadership in artificial intelligence while safeguarding economic prosperity and national 
security. Through clear thematic strategies , building collaborative ecosystems, 
transforming industries with AI, managing leadership transitions, developing the 
workforce, and innovating in investment, the plan addresses the challenge from multiple 
angles. To move forward, the following immediate next steps are recommended for 
policymakers and industry leaders: ●Public Communication and Stakeholder Buy-In: Communicate the vision of
America 2.0 - Mission T.47 an AI-powered economic revival, to the public to
build support. Emphasize not just the competitive necessity, but how these
actions will create jobs, improve services, and secure the nation. Transparency
and inclusion are essential; invite feedback from communities, civil society (to
address ethical concerns), and the private sector. This could be done throughpublic-private forums unified in the USA Economic Forum.
Page 14 of 15 


●Form a National AI Action Task Force to begin implementation. This task force,
perhaps under OSTP or a joint interagency council, would prioritize the plan’s
recommendations, assign roles to various agencies (DoD, DoE, DoC, NSF, etc.),
and set timelines. Including representation from industry, academia, and state
governments will help maintain the collaborative spirit.
●Secure Funding and Legislative Support: Work with Congress to authorize
and appropriate funding for key initiatives like the Collaborative Innovation Hubs
network and the public-private investment arm. Legislative action may be needed
to provide tax incentives (e.g., training credits, Section 174 fix) and to establish
new programs (such as the AI Leadership Academy or veteran transition
programs). Early engagement with lawmakers can ensure these ideas are
translated into policy.●Pilot Programs: Launch pilot versions of CIHs in a few regions, focusing on
different themes (for example, defense tech in a Midwestern state, clean energy
AI in a Western state) to demonstrate the model. Similarly, pilot the mentorship
and succession platform in one or two industries with high retirement rates.
●Alignment with Ethical and Security Frameworks: As implementation begins,
integrate the latest guidelines for responsible AI (such as the AI Bill of Rights and
DoD’s ethical AI principles) into each action. For instance, CIHs should have
committees on ethics to ensure that the development of technology is fair and
secure. Workforce programs should include training on AI ethics. By design, our
plan has highlighted ethics and privacy as considerations; concretizing that in
execution will maintain public trust and prevent unintended harm.
The United States stands at a pivotal moment. If we act decisively and collaboratively, 
we can usher in a new era of American innovation, an America 2.0 where AI 
technologies bolster our economy, reinforce our national security, and uplift all citizens' 
living standards. Conversely, inaction or disjointed efforts risk ceding leadership to 
adversaries and exacerbating domestic divides.  
In closing, the message from experts and commissions is clear: the U.S. must act now 
(NSCAI Report: US Can Gain Leading Edge on AI With This Plan | GovCIO Media & 
Research ). By implementing the strategies in this document, decision-makers can 
ensure the country not only keeps pace with the AI revolution, but leads it in a direction 
that aligns with American values and interests. We can launch America into its next 
great chapter of technological advancement and societal prosperity with commitment 
and cooperation.
