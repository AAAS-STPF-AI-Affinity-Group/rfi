General Comment
Stripping copyright protections from  everyday Am ericans who rely on their writing and art to m ake a living is an appalling prospect that
enriches Silicon Valley tech billionaires at the expense of working people and fam ilies. OpenAI and other tech com panies have offered no
com pelling explanation as to why this is necessary for "national security"; I strongly believe they claim  it is so that they won't have to pay
for data to train on. AI's unsustainable business m odel is not Am erica's problem  to solve. I oppose giving AI a copyright exem ption in the
strongest possible term s.
