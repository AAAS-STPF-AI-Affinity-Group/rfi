Good evening.
I have been aware about recent plans from AI companies, such as Open AI, trying to push formore control and using copyrighted material. As both a practicing artist and someone whoappreciates artistic mediums as a whole, I do not believe generative AI has a place in thiscountry. It has profited off of theft, stealing from those who actually earned their talents, in anage when such work isn't as appreciated as it should be, and as a whole, generative AI isoverhyped and is likely fleeting. So if anyone is listening and actually cares about theAmerican people, I would implore you to PLEASE stop these generative AI companies frommaking things worse than they already are. Thank you.
