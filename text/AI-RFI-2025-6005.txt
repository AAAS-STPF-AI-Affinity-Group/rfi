General Comment
This use of generative AI is m orally and ethically wrong for a variety of reasons. This should not com e to pass as it will have awful
consequences for various working individuals as well as the environm ent. Not only does it violate copyright laws, but it also steals the hard
work of various individuals just to profit off of them  and their work. Please reconsider allowing these groups to continue utilizing generative
AI without consequence as it will only lead to worse outcom es.
