General Comment
AI m odels should be lim ited to training on public inform ation, not on copyrighted works. If they can copy copyrighted works, what is
copyright even for? I do believe AI has a place in the US, but it should be built as sustainably as possible and built on works that are set
of the public dom ain. Hum an work should be paid for. Thank you!
