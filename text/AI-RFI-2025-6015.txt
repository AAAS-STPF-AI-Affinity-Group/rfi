General Comment
I am  a public educator with 30 years of classroom  teaching experience. The use of AI in the classroom  should be with guard rails so that
the protection of intellectual property and copyright m aterial is protected/preserved. It would be very negligent to rem ove these and/or not
provide any of these guards and allow students to com prom ise copyrighted m aterial. 
The use of AI should not be allowed to scrape the data of any copyright m aterials as well (written, spoken, audio, m usic, art, etc...). This
is protected m aterial and should rem ain protected against AI data scraping as well. 
The use of AI in general has a very large and negative environm ental im pact with excessive usage of electricity and water for powering and
cooling the data centers that are providing the com puting power on the back end. (There are plans to re-com m ission old power plants just
to provide the power for data centers that are powering the AI processing being needed.) Again, regulations and guards on these data
centers m ust be m andatory so that they are carbon neutral or BETTER for the environm ent and not worse for the environm ent.
