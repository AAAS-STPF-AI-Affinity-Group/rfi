General Comment
AI is overhyped and is taking valuable jobs away from  hard working Am ericans. It is also norm alizing copyright infringem ent and
intellectual property theft. Giving AI any sort of blanket exem ption to copyright laws will only further dam age our econom y as m ore
businesses pivot to this kind of theft rather than tangibly contributing to our econom y.
