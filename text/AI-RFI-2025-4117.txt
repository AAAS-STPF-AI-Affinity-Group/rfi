General Comment
I do not believe ai should be developed further as there are other m ore im portant things to do in Am erica, like for exam ple, starting
m easures to protect students from  shooters better or m aking shooter prevention program s of sorts. I just think the country is better off
doing som ething m ore productive than focusing on AI.
