General Comment
This will not bring a brighter future for all Am ericans. All it will bring is far m ore struggles for the everyday working m an as prices for
electricity surge due to the am ount required by the data centers to power AI. Billions of dollars have already been poured into AI research
and developm ent- and there have been no significant gains at all within the past year to the point where OpenAi is operating at a lost. The
Ai bubble is bursting and there is no reason to continue down this foolish path when Am ericans are already struggling to provide for their
own fam ilies.
