General Comment
My nam e is Candace, and I strongly oppose the AI Action Plan recently proposed by President Donald Trum p. The Am erican
governm ent has rightfully placed regulations that prevent the harm ful use of AI. AI should not have such access to our private inform ation
unless it has gone through extensive testing and approval, with the added cyber security needed to protect confidential and classified data
am ong all sectors. I do not trust loosening the reigns on AI use for our governm ent, for the sam e reasons I wouldn't reduce regulations
from  the FDA. Our citizens could be com prom ised and/or harm ed if the use of AI is not handled carefully.
