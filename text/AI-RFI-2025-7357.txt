General Comment
OpenAI is trained on too wide a spread of data, and as such what it outputs is often incorrect and harm ful. Sim ply adding m ore data to it,
one that circum vents the intellectual rights of our artists and other creative workers, is not going to m agically m ake OpenAI's output better.
The m essy data already inside OpenAI's m odel will not be corrected by sim ply adding m ore data to it. AI is not m agic. Machine learning
is a very deliberate process that works best with a clear aim  in m ind and clean data.
In addition, we should value our artists' and creators' work. There is no better m ind or creator than a hum an m ind. We should encourage
people to create on their own, let children draw art using their own m inds and hands. Nurturing that creativity will lead us to true
innovation. OpenAI is not a m ind that can be nurtured to bring us innovation. It is a m achine reliant on 0s, 1s, and electricity. It cannot and
should not replace a hum an's creativity. Protect our creators.
