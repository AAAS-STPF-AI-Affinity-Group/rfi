General Comment
Absolutely against and appalled at the prospect of allowing tech corporations.to steal copyrighted m aterial to train their faulty generative
AI that ONLY works if it's utilizing things already m ade. If you can't train an ai on your own knowledge and what you have created it is
theft. Copyrighted m aterial is m eant to be safe from  this sort of anti-intellectual property theft. Allowing a com pany to steal som eone's
work to m ake m oney off of it is all that generative AI does and is a danger to those in the creative arts - a population that already struggles
to have their m onetary needs m et despite the im portant im pact art has on the world. If a hum an couldn't be bothered to m ake it, it isn't
worth seeing and having to steal other's work to m ake som ething not worth seeing is harm ful and insulting.
