General Comment
AI is being used as an excuse for theft, and a m eans of stifling the reasoning process.
Big com panies are shutting out sm all businesses and individual entrepreneurs by stealing their work online, calling it "research" when
they're really trawling for m aterial they can regurgitate and resell under their own brand.
For the governm ent to declare this practice legal is gross overreach, denying the rights of individuals in favor of granting only those with
m oney any rights. 
It is a stifling of the individual's right to com m unication, creation, and earning a living, which flies in the face of Am erican individualism  and
the pursuit of excellence.
Allowing AI scrapers to thieve and kludge together the data it collects is no better and no m ore logical than allowing a cem ent truck to
determ ine where sidewalks should be placed in a city. You m ay as well ask a m icrowave about nutrition because it prepares food that's
put into it.
Allowing corporations to steal individuals' work is robbing people of their livelihood, which they've labored at for years. It's condoning
theft, plain and sim ple.
