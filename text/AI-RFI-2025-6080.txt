General Comment
Life is nothing without art m ade by hum ans. Artists need to not only survive but thrive to create art, and tech corporations stealing our
life’s work to create ethically dubious content will prevent us from  doing so. The use of genAI is an ethics issue, privacy issue, security
issue, copyright issue, environm ental issue, and m ore. Freedom  of expression shouldn’t com e at the cost of theft and exploitation.
