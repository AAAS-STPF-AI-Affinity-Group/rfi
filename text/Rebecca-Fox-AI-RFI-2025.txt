The AI industry is a speculative waste of resources. It's a plagiarism machine that spits out  
garbage. No one likes or wants it. It's trying to take the work of thinking, art, and  
communication away from humanity. It steals people's livelihoods. 
There are some very discrete purposes for which AI has been and can be useful. As an all-
purpose tool, however, AI only exists to enrich its owners, at the cost of our planet, jobs, and  
creativity.
