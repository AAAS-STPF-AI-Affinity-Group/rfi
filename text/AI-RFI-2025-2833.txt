General Comment
Generative Artificial Intelligence has been nothing but harm ful since it's inception and it's honestly flabbergasting that it's gotten to this point.
This proposition is theft, plain and sim ple. The only way that this m odel can exist is by stealing other's content and inform ation. Not only is
this a flagrant disregard to privacy, but is blatantly illegal and should be considered as such.
As a creative, m y livelihood is in direct peril. Using m y properties and ideas without m y consent is copyright theft. If AI can just
circum vent that, then what is the point? In fact, why is it that they need to take anything and everything in order to work? It is because they
are a farce. The only reason that these AI m odels exist is to steal and profit off of individuals, plain and sim ple. They are fully aware that
what they are doing should be, and is, illegal, which is precisely why they want those walls torn down.
Frankly, if anything, allowing such crim inal behavior to exist will certainly spell disaster. There is no future for them . No one is asking for
them . The only ones recom m ending them  are corporate suits that stand to m ake or lose a profit on them . I have no doubt that allowing
these m odels to wantonly leech off of literally everyone is a bad idea. Mark m y words: enabling this will be disastrous to so m any
individuals and collectives, and everyone will know who to blam e when the bubble bursts.
