My name is James ayers, and i am a concerned citizen. I find this attempted intergration of
language learning models (and other technologies referred to as "AI") into governmentalpractice to be a tremendous threat to the privacy and wellbeing of every American citizen. Letit be known that I, and many other visual and/or motion artists like myself, are heavily againstthe normalization and profitization of these technologies as they pose a risk to humancreativity and is designed to do away with jobs that people study many passionate years to do.
