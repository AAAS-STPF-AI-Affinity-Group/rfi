 Current Challenges and Limitations of AI in Surgical Settings 
 The operating theater represents one of the most complex decision environments in 
 contemporary healthcare delivery - particularly in the context of trauma surgery (e.g., 
 battlefield) and re-operative surgery. Unlike many other procedural contexts (e.g., 
 interventional cardiology working exclusively within a vascular lumen) where workflows, 
 instrumentation, and anatomic relationships can be fully anticipated and mapped in advance, 
 trauma and re-operative surgery demands continuous adaptation to unexpected findings, 
 anatomical variations, and emergent complications. The necessity for continuous adaptation 
 to emergent conditions - responding to unexpected findings, managing uncertainty, and 
 adjusting to evolving tissue responses or technical execution errors - represents the 
 fundamental challenge of surgical contingency planning and robotics advancement. This 
 complex reality creates both unprecedented opportunities and distinctive hurdles for 
 computational intelligence in the operating theater, substantially advancing current 
 commercial robotics products whose platforms are limited to enhanced tool manipulation. 
 Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on available clinical data offer promising capabilities 
 for general medical knowledge retrieval and pattern recognition, but they face significant 
 1 


 limitations in the surgical procedural context. The statistical nature of these models creates 
 blind spots precisely where surgical decision-making requires the greatest precision: 
 ● Clinical training data inherently underrepresents complications and rare events,
 skewing model understanding toward common, successful cases. An extensive review
 of operative reports and surgical morbidity and mortality case reviews by this author
 over the past 35 years confirms the parsimony and under-representation of events
 and observations in this corpus of training data, primarily driven by medical-legal
 concerns.
 ● Surgical complications emerge from complex causal chains with temporal dynamics
 that current probabilistic models struggle to capture faithfully.
 ● The tacit knowledge that experienced surgeons employ when navigating unexpected
 scenarios remains inadequately documented and formalized in the published
 literature that forms LLM training data.
 These limitations create a fundamental mismatch between the statistical reasoning of 
 current AI systems and the causal, constraint-based reasoning required for effective surgical 
 contingency planning. 
 The Computational Requirements for Embedded Real-Time Surgical 
 Intelligence and the Case for Symbolic Reasoning as Critical Augmentation 
 AI technology required to support real-time surgical decision-making or embedded 
 intelligence in surgical robotics requires specialized computational architecture designed for 
 both performance and reliability: 
 ● Latency constraints  demand response times under 200ms for time-critical guidance
 ● Contextual awareness  necessitates extensive context windows (50K-100K tokens) to
 maintain the full procedural history
 ● Parallel processing  of multiple potential contingency pathways simultaneously
 ● Uncertainty quantification  with explicit representation of confidence in different
 intervention options, requiring specialized inference optimization
 2 


 ● Specialized management of complexity  with dynamic model pruning based on
 procedure type and resource allocation algorithms that prioritize time-sensitive
 inference during critical surgical phases (so-called critical path prioritization).
 However, the core challenge extends beyond raw computational power to the fundamental 
 reasoning architecture needed for surgical intelligence. Pure neural approaches to surgical 
 intelligence (i.e., based exclusively on LLM/foundational models with fine-tuning on 
 domain-specific data) face inherent limitations that will require hybrid approaches that 
 symbolic reasoning systems. Symbolic systems can formally encode anatomical 
 relationships, physiological parameters, procedural constraints, and human behavioral 
 variations (e.g., models of risk tolerance) that must be satisfied regardless of statistical 
 patterns. This provides essential guardrails for AI-generated contingency plans. Formal 
 temporal logic frameworks can explicitly represent the evolution of surgical scenarios over 
 time, including critical intervention windows and causal relationships between actions and 
 outcomes. For example, when managing complex intra-abdominal trauma, multiple critical 
 factors, including progressive blood loss, deteriorating metabolic parameters, declining core 
 temperature, limited resource availability, and competing demands for resources in a mass 
 casualty scenario, may necessitate the rapid formulation and execution of a sequentially 
 staged approach. Such damage control strategies might involve temporary abdominal 
 packing and closure, strategic pausing to assess survivability and potential disability 
 outcomes, followed by definitive repair during a subsequent procedure when the patient has 
 been physiologically stabilized. 
 Symbolic methods enable formal verification of proposed interventions against explicit safety 
 criteria, providing necessary assurance for high-stakes surgical decisions. The most 
 promising path forward for innovation and R&D requires a hybrid neuro-symbolic 
 architectures that combine the pattern recognition strengths of  LLMs with the precision and 
 constraint satisfaction capabilities of symbolic systems. 
 Cross-Domain Inspiration: Learning from Other Sectors 
 3 


 Several non-medical domains have pioneered in embedded intelligence for high-stakes, 
 real-time decision support; these may offer insights and blueprints for advancement in 
 surgical applications. The aerospace industry has developed rigorous frameworks for 
 human-AI collaboration in contexts where failures are catastrophic. These systems blend 
 probabilistic reasoning with hard constraints and feature explicit anomaly detection that 
 could be adapted to identify developing surgical complications. Chemical processing and 
 other high-risk industrial facilities employ fault tolerance systems with formal verification 
 methods and digital twin technology that could be repurposed to provide real-time 
 simulation of alternative surgical approaches. Self-driving systems feature commercially 
 viable edge-computing implementations for real-time scene understanding, deploying 
 localized uncertainty quantification algorithms and safety envelope enforcement through 
 symbolic guardrails that operate directly on in-vehicle neural systems without requiring 
 cloud connectivity. 
 Despite the transformative potential of surgical intelligence systems, a persistent barrier to 
 advancement remains the misalignment of commercial incentives, where proven 
 technologies from aerospace, autonomous vehicles, and industrial processing systems have 
 not been applied to surgical contexts due to smaller markets, higher regulatory hurdles, and 
 entrenched clinical workflows that discourage cross-domain technology transfer. 
 What is Required to Advance AI-Surgical Intelligence R&D? 
 Advancing this field requires strategic research priorities across multiple dimensions, 
 including model development, infrastructure, and validation frameworks. The following 
 summarizes recommended priorities: 
 Technical Research Priorities 
 1. Development of causal inference models specifically designed to learn surgical
 cause-effect relationships from limited data
 2. Creation of explainable hybrid systems that provide reasoning transparency during
 critical decisions
 4 


 3. Advancement of few-shot learning frameworks for rare complications with minimal
 training examples
 4. Application of  safety envelope enforcement  concept in a surgical context (e.g., explicit
 anatomical no-go zones, computationally defined regions containing critical
 structures that cannot be violated regardless of what the neural network component
 might suggest, operating through real-time geometric constraint checking, where
 each proposed instrument movement is verified against formalized anatomical safety
 maps before execution).
 Infrastructure Requirements 
 1. Establishment of modular architecture standards allowing component-wise validation
 2. Construction of comprehensive surgical knowledge graphs with formal representation
 of procedural knowledge
 3. Development of multi-center federated learning systems to capture diverse patient
 populations
 Validation Approaches 
 1. Simulation-based certification protocols before clinical deployment
 2. Gradual autonomy frameworks similar to autonomous vehicle levels, establishing
 clear progression paths for surgical AI capabilities
 3. Surgical digital twins for risk-free testing of embedded intelligence
 Investing in the Development of Gradual Autonomy Frameworks for Surgical 
 Intelligence 
 Even with advances in model development and technical infrastructure, one should 
 anticipate substantial regulatory and adoption hurdles. The implementation of AI in surgical 
 settings requires a methodical, stepwise approach to ensure safety and clinical efficacy. To 
 overcome such hurdles, there should be equal R&D investment into the development of 
 novel validation frameworks.  Drawing inspiration from autonomous vehicle development, a 
 5 


 gradual autonomy framework for surgical intelligence provides a structured pathway for 
 research, validation, and clinical integration. 
 Level 1: Enhanced Visualization and Awareness 
 At this initial level, AI systems provide information augmentation without direct intervention 
 recommendations: 
 ● Real-time identification and labeling of anatomical structures
 ● Detection of tissue boundaries and critical structures
 ● Physiological monitoring with early warning indicators
 ● Tracking of instrument positioning relative to critical structures
 The surgeon maintains complete control, with the system providing enhanced situational 
 awareness similar to advanced radar systems in aviation. 
 Level 2: Decision Support with Surgeon Validation 
 The second level introduces passive decision support capabilities: 
 ● Suggestion of potential next steps in the procedural workflow
 ● Identification of deviation from planned approach
 ● Early warning of developing complications based on subtle indicators
 ● Presentation of relevant case history or literature for emerging scenarios
 All suggestions require explicit surgeon approval before implementation, maintaining a clear 
 human-in-the-loop paradigm. 
 Level 3: Procedural Assistance with Supervision 
 At this level, systems can perform specific subtasks under direct supervision: 
 ● Camera positioning and stability maintenance
 ● Tissue retraction assistance
 ● Dissection path suggestion with real-time adjustment
 6 


 ● Suture placement guidance with tension monitoring
 The fully-trained surgeon supervises all activities and can immediately override any system 
 action. 
 Level 4: Autonomous Execution of Defined Subtasks 
 With sufficient validation, specific well-defined subtasks may be delegated: 
 ● Standardized suturing of predetermined tissue planes
 ● Precise tumor margin identification and marking
 ● Optimal port placement based on patient-specific anatomy
 ● Tissue perfusion assessment and mapping
 The fully-trained initiates each subtask and maintains override capability throughout. 
 Level 5: Contingency Management 
 Advanced systems would incorporate the ability to: 
 ● Automatically adjust to unexpected anatomical variations
 ● Identify developing complications and initiate appropriate responses
 ● Modify surgical approaches based on intraoperative findings
 ● Continuously recalculate risk profiles as the procedure evolves
 ● Incorporate meta-system events and states (e.g., mass casualty, resource reserves,
 competing demands for resources) to adjust case-specific procedural plans
 These capabilities would be implemented with extensive safeguards and validation protocols. 
 A graduated approach ensures that surgical AI earns trust incrementally through 
 demonstrated capability and reliability rather than attempting revolutionary but potentially 
 unsafe paradigm shifts. 
 The Path Forward 
 7 


 The future of surgical intelligence lies not in replacing clinical judgment but in augmenting it 
 with systems that blend the complementary strengths of neural and symbolic approaches. 
 By learning from advances in aerospace, financial, and autonomous systems, we can develop 
 hybrid architectures that maintain human surgical expertise as the final authority while 
 providing increasingly sophisticated decision support. Achieving this vision, however, requires 
 overcoming significant economic barriers that currently impede progress. The surgical 
 technology market, while substantial, remains fragmented and risk-averse compared to 
 consumer technology sectors. Despite proven concepts in adjacent fields, private sector 
 investment has been insufficient to bridge the "valley of death" between promising research 
 and clinically viable systems—particularly for technologies requiring lengthy regulatory 
 pathways and hospital adoption cycles. This market failure represents a classic case for 
 targeted federal investment through agencies like the National Science Foundation. NSF 
 funding for high-risk, high-reward surgical AI concepts that lack immediate commercial 
 viability but promise significant patient benefit would accelerate progress in ways that 
 market forces alone cannot achieve. By supporting pre-competitive research in surgical 
 intelligence, particularly in domains like symbolic reasoning, formal verification, and 
 human-AI collaboration models, NSF and other federal R&D support can catalyze an 
 ecosystem that eventually becomes self-sustaining through later-stage private investment. 
 The most promising immediate direction combines the redundancy and verification systems 
 from aerospace with the real-time decision capabilities from industrial processing systems, 
 creating a new class of surgical intelligence that respects the unique contingency 
 requirements of the operating theater while enhancing the surgeon's ability to navigate 
 unexpected scenarios safely and effectively. With strategic federal support to overcome 
 current market limitations, we can accelerate this integration and dramatically improve 
 surgical outcomes across diverse healthcare environments worldwide.
