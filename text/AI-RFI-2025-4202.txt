General Comment
Generative AI is not a venture that benefits hum anity as a whole, or even just Am erica. Whatever benefits the concept holds has been
taken over by bad actors who insist upon weaponizing it to devalue art and artists. The people m anaging AI databases need to be held
accountable when they engage in theft, using art they have no ownership over as part of their engines.
