General Comment
Every citizen of the United States should be protected by copyright law. If AI is trained on artists' work without their consent, that is
already unacceptable and inappropriate. Others should not be able to profit from  AI work generated from  these sources.
I'd also like to add that AI doesn't really add anything new, innovative, or m eaningful to the "art" it creates like a hum an would. A hum an
inspired by art creates som ething new from  it by referencing other techniques--and real life!--and adding their own style. AI just m ixes up
existing references and m ashes them  together. It dilutes rather than adding and innovating. You can often tell where the art was taken
from . This isn't how we should be getting our art and it is not a replacem ent for an artist. You can't just take a bunch of art, put it in a
blender, spit it back up and call it original. It is not the sam e thing. Som ething new m ust be added for it to be original. That is what m akes
it art. That's why AI is useful as a brainstorm ing tool, but not a final work.
