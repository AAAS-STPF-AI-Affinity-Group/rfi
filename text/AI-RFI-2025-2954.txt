General Comment
What’s the point of working if Ai is going to control? 
What’s the point of trying to be m ore if som ething is autom ated and dished out without im agining.
Cheap knockoffs of copy’s running the world.
Are we not supposed teach about what is true.
I am  trapped by an ai in m y work place. I cannot change how to interact with clients due to having to follow a particular set of instructions
and tim e.
Hum anity is supposed to be som ething, raw, new and kind of m essy; if it’s a copy, the ai will m ake everything feel disconnected. A world
generated algorithm s. A false narrative of idea.
The world feeds off the living.
I have becom e depressed in m y job.
I am  losing hope in the Am erican dream , that’s fading away every year as I go on.
I have dream s of writing and art. I do hard m anual labor, pay m y taxes and I live every day for a better tom orrow. Hoping for a day I
don’t have to stress or struggle.
I m ay not be a college graduate or a degree in scholarly advancem ent. But I know feelings and see pain in the eyes of people every single
day.
This is when a lie and truth finally blur? The Ai.
No one will know who is, who was, or who will be.
I don’t want to be part of the em ptiness m achine.
I don’t want to live in that world.
I can’t.
I won’t.
(We the willing
led by the unknowing
are doing the im possible
for the ungrateful,
we have done so
m uch for so long,
with so little,
we have becom e qualified
to do anything with nothing… -anonym ous)
