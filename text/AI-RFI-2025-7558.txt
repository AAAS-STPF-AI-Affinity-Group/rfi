General Comment
I’m  cautious and affronted that in order for AI to operate as it does now, it requires broad and undefined perm ission to use im ages and
m edia that its creators *do not own.* Like, what, there isn’t even a plan to negotiate for artists and photographers and writers to choose
to willingly subm it their work with com pensation,? We just let AI ram pantly take and process anything for usage, even copyrighted works
or personal creations?
And then there’s the concern of AI deepfake videos spreading m isinform ation of things that never happened, or god, people getting fake
nudes m ade of them  like what happened with Taylor Swift. It’s a disgusting m isuse of technology that puts people at risk of being
deceived or hurt.
And every tim e these issues com e up, there’s never a clear answer from  the AI-approved side on how AI’s power will be lim ited to
prevent abuse. As things are right now I don’t see a future for AI in federal use unless it com es with strict lim its.
