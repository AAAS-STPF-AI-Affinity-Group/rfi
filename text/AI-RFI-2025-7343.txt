General Comment
This is affront to the idea of copyright and to protection that artists should legitim ately have over their work. This Action Plan serves only
to line the pockets of already wealthy who seek to pillage the work of artists without - and often clearly against - artists' consent, as if it
was their property. The gall of AI com panies requiring legal protection form  pirating the copyrighted work this way is appailing.
