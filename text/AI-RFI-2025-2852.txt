General Comment
As an artist, I am  against the use of AI for im age creation. Not only is the scraping of our im ages illegal and against copyright, it is
dem oralizing. AI should be used for the good of the people, not take away life's pleasures such as the creation of art. Not only that, but
the environm ental im pact of AI is so high that at this stage of our technology, we will not have a world to live in if we decide to help its
health decline further. It is not worth the lives of the people around us.
Until you find a way that this does not im pact our environm ent, this should not be entertained in the slightest.
