General Comment
Organizations using and training artificial intelligence should be required to docum ent all sources. If source m aterial does not already have
a creative com m ons license, users should be required to request access for use, which m ay require paym ent or m ay legitim ately denied. If
violations of use are found, com panies should be financially liable for copyright violations. As an educator, I work hard to ensure students
understand the value of their ideas and others' ideas. They are required to cite sources and give credit when they rely on the intellectual
property of others. It would be com pletely hypocritical to allow corporations to use others' intellectual property without proper perm ission
or credit when even m iddle school students know that is wrong. We need strong regulations on use of artificial intelligence.
