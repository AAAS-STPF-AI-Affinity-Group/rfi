General Comment
The GenAI industry thinks they can coerce us into allowing ram pant theft without so m uch as a "by your leave" to creators, m uch less
adequate com pensation despite their claim s their product can't exist without the art & writing of others. The truth is their only leverage is
the threat to take their ball and go hom e. While there is real potential for other form s of AI the only kind dependent on such theft is the
one that has no m echanism s to prevent it from  spreading m isinform ation and propaganda, the type of AI m ost easily tricked into
reproducing its training data. If it can't exist without stealing from  others then it doesn't get to exist.
