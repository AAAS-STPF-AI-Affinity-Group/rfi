General Comment
I'm  com m enting on the action plan that we need to keep the current laws. I use variation services like Google to store m y work in
progress and com pleted works. I design and develop video gam es which includes coding, artwork, and writing. All of which I solely
create.
If the laws are changed and com panies are allowed to use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI, then the AI com panies m ust negotiate and
PAY every copyright holder a fair am ount of m oney for use. Creators whether they code, write, draw, am ong other things do so to
generate incom e from  their works. Allowing AI com panies to use it for free is against econom ic sense and stepping upon rights of
copyright owners due to their abuse.
I and m any others, both com panies and creators, are and will be deeply im pacted by allowing these AI com panies to use copyrighted
m aterials for a quite frankly novelty product. As I have already lost incom e for people assum ing m y work is that of AI, which is quite
insulting to m e and the tim e I put into m y craft. The AI com panies m ust respect copyright laws.
