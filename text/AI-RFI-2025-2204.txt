General Comment
It should be a issue already that this stuffs needs copyrighted m aterial, stealing from  creative m inds, to function. Now to give it a pass on
stealing such m aterial I question why big corporations would be allowed to sue if others used their copyrighted m aterial. It m akes no
sense, on top of the fact no one but the lazy and greedy want this stuff to be rid of even m ore jobs. Get rid of it.
