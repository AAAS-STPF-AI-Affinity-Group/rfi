General Comment
Ai generation can only be achieved through theft. AI pieces are not created, they are copied. This is textbook copyright infringem ent. The
fact it is stolen by a m achine instead of a hum an changes nothing. Art is sacred. It is a hum an right as well as a hum an necessity. AI can
only be used to steal. A hum an needs to be in control in order for a piece to be derivative or inspired. A m achine can not be inspired, it
can m erely reflect what it sees.
