General Comment
Artificial Intelligence is not just a "tool" as m any would have us believe. It is nothing like a pencil, brush, cam era, or m usical instrum ent. It is
a m im ic, dependent upon the creations of others. Without a body of work to exam ine and extract, it has no ability to create anything.
That body of work is been fully and clearly protected by copyright law to protect the ability of its creators to enjoy the full financial benefit
of their talent and hard work. AI is nothing m ore than open theft of that benefit.
Freeing AI of copyright regulations will not result in innovation. It will only m utate and distort the innovation that already exists, and
com m it fraud upon the innovators.
