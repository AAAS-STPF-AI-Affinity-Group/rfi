General Comment
If any random  private citizen did what these AI com panies want to do, you'd throw the book at them . It is unclear to m e why I have to
explain why a floundering tech com pany shouldn't get to just violate the intellectual property rights of untold m illions of writers, m usicians,
artists and other perform ers, but here I am : this is obviously absurd and im m oral. This country is not ruled by Executive Order.
