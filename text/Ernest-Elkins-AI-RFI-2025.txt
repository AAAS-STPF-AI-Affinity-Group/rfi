To whom it may concern,
I do not think AI has a future in the United States of America. It is a system that uses stolen
data to operate, and therefore steals from the American public. It has cost Americans theirjobs, thus threatening their livelihoods and ability to contribute to the economy.
 
AI is not a tool of the future. OpenAI and other models like it are thieves, and have no place inthe future of this country.
 
Best,  
Ernest Elkins
