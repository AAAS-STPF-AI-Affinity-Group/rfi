General Comment
AI has no place in the future of this country, and steals from  m ine and m y friends' and fam ilies' livelihoods as Am ericans. AI is fleeting, and
does nothing but profit from  theft and is an irresponsible use of our lim ited natural resources. I am  disgusted this is even a debate.
