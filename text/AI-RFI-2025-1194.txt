General Comment
My nam e is William  Onyshko, I am  a 2nd sem ester senior in high school at Avonworth High School in Pittsburgh, PA. I am  currently
enrolled in two new classes "Hum an Flourishing" and "AI and Ethics". I studied generative AI and its im pact on the accounting com m unity
for two m onths in this course. From  m y research, I think this current adm inistration's viewpoint on AI regulation is to be used as a tool. AI
has a very high chance of taking this job type, but we should not elim inate jobs. So I applaud your cam paign for not wanting to do so but
would like to see it as a tool and not a crutch even im plem ented m ore into schools. As we have a class on it as this could be the future of
the world.
