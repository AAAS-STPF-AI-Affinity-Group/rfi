General Comment
Far from  innovation, the abolition of the executive order restricting com panies from  using AI is going to spell absolute disaster for creative
endeavor and scientific research across the entire country, as corporate thieves eagerly cram  the hard work of thousands of skilled
Am ericans into jum bled and clum sily executed m achine regurgitation so flagrantly incapable of basic functionality anyone else would have
been laughed off the global stage.
It is inexcusable and worthy of the highest scorn.
