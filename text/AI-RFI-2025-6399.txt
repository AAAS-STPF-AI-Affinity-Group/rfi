General Comment
I do not consent to letting ai com panies use m y work just because it's posted online. No artist does. You cannot just m ake theft legal for
random  com panies especially when none of us agree to let them . They take our work against our will and give us no way to fight back or
say no. This will hurt so m any people please stop this.
