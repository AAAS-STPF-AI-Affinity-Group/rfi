General Comment
Everything about this is terrible. The adm inistration is going to allow oligarchs to take advantage of labor continuously and endorse it. This
is a transfer of wealth from  the working class to the rich. “AI” which isn’t even accurately nam ed needs incredibly strict regulation in every
sector for various reasons. The working class understand these concepts. The second Trum p adm inistration is totally untrustworthy if this
continues and one by one we all know it. We aren’t stupid.
