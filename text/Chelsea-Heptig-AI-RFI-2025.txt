To whom it may concern,  
My babe is Chelsea Heptig and this is a terrible idea. I do not believe AI holds a place in the
future of the US. AI is actively making Americans dumber and removing the need for criticalthinking and reading skills in our population.
 
AI steals from my livelihood as an American and profits off of theft of original works. Thiswill set a precedence that copywrite means nothing anymore and content theft and copyrightinfringement will no longer be punishable by law.
 
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the American public.
