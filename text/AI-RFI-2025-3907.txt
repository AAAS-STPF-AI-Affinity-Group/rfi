General Comment
I do not believe AI holds any future in the US. Not only is public opinion of AI cratering every day, as som eone in an artistic field AI
directly stands to steal from  m y livelihood and profits off of theft. The fact that AI com panies are adam ant that their industry would not be
able to function without this unprecedented level of copyright violations and theft of intellectual property should be a hint. AI is also a
speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and huge legal problem s by enabling them .
It's m assively overhyped and is fleecing the Am erican public at large.
