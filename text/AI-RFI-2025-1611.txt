General Comment
I am  an illustrator and author. I find AI technology to be am oral and reprehensible. AI technology is built upon The theft of copywritten
works and is therefore illegal. It is also an extrem e waste of m oney as it's profits have been shown to be plum m eting. It is proving to be a
nuisance that no consum er asked for or wants.
