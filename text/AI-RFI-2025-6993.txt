General Comment
Generative AI is a com plicated statistical tool for m aking derivative works--nothing m ore, nothing less. The fact that its output (usually)
derive from  a large body of works sim ultaneously does not m ake it any less derivative. The designers of generative AI tools them selves
state that without unrestricted, uncom pensated access to a large body of copywritten works the tools cannot function, i.e. the tools wholly
depend on uncom pensated creative work.
To allow a copyright exem ption for generative AI is to m ake a m ockery of copyright itself.
