General Comment
While there have been m any advancem ents in statistical analysis and m achine autom ation that have m ade contem porary life a m odern
m arvel, the hype around "AI" is overblown and m isleading. There is nothing unique to their process or product that has invented a robot
with the capacity for new and innovative ideas. These m odels are built on the work and taught on the work of hum an beings who have
rights. Further, certain m odels should be investigated for illegal data gathering practices and violations of intellectual property laws.
