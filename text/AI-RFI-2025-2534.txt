General Comment
Use of generative AI of any purpose violates Am ericans' rights to their own intellectual property, especially those in creative fields. These
program s are written with the sole purpose of stealing copyrighted im ages, as well as audio and video files, in order to use them  (without
consent) to train a com puter to unlawfully replicate the stolen m aterials on dem and. 
Intellectual property and copyright laws aside, the use of generative AI will NEVER offer new or im aginative creation. It can only jum ble
up what has been fed into its algorithm s and spit out a lower quality replication. Machine replication will NEVER com pare to genuine
hum an creation and it should not be touted as a way toward a 'brighter future' when it directly opposes intellectual property/copyright laws
and jobs in creative fields. Generative AI will displace m illions of people from  their jobs and thrust corporate creative industries as a whole
into a tailspin of financial losses because it will only be able to achieve vague m echanical garbage devoid of passion and true creativity.
The only way to a brighter future is to divest from  generative AI and invest in your HUMAN CITIZENS, pay artists for their work!
