General Comment
I am  a freelance artist in the US. By stealing m y work, AI threatens m y livelihood and jeopardizes m y future. We need m ore robust
protections for Am ericans against AI, not fewer! If AI com panies want com m ercial access to our art, they can pay for it just like everyone
else.
