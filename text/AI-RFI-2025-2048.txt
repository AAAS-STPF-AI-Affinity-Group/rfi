General Comment
I do not believe generative artificial intelligence has any place in the further developm ent of our nation or our species. AI has becom e an
unavoidable plague that takes the hum anity out of creative endeavors. It has its place, but the creation of an action plan in order to ensure
"dom inance" feels like a m assive waste of tim e and budget that I, as a proud United States citizen, would like to avoid. 
The only plans put in place should be those involving regulation.
