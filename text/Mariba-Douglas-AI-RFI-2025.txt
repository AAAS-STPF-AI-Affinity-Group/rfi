SECTION 1: AI GOVERNANCE AND INNOVATION (RFI Areas 1, 4)  
Recommendation 1: Implement Comprehensive Data Governance Protocols  
Challenge:  The current AI landscape lacks standardized frameworks for data governance, 
creating uncertainties for developers, potential security vulnerabilities, and limited accountability 
in AI supply chains. 
 


Proposed Solution:  Establish the American Data Governance Framework (ADGF) that:  
1.1. Creates clear standards for data provenance1, quality assessment, and usage rights 
documentation  
1.2. Establishes federally recognized certification processes for datasets used in high -risk AI 
applications  
1.3. Develops interoperable consent mechanisms that preserve individual rights while enabling 
innovation  
1.4. Implements mandatory disclosure requirements for training data sources in critical AI 
systems  
Alignment with National Priorities: 
●Enhances U.S. technological self-determination through transparent data supply chains
●Creates competitive advantage through higher data quality and reliability standards
●Reduces regulatory uncertainty that may currently hampers American AI businesses
Measurable Outcomes:  
●Document reductions in data -related AI failures within 3 years of implementation
●Measure increases in documented datasets available for responsible AI development
●Creation of 3 -5 new American global standards for data governance
Implementation Timeline:  
●Phase 1 (12 months): Voluntary standard development through NIST collaboration
●Phase 2 (18 months): Pilot implementation across federal AI acquisitions
●Phase 3 (24 months): Full implementation with industry certification program
SECTION 2:  RESPONSIBLE AI DEVELOPMENT (RFI Areas 2, 7)  
Recommendation 2: Mandate Technical Transparency Documentation  
Challenge:  The absence of standardized documentation on AI limitations creates risks for 
critical infrastructure, national security, and public safety while undermining trust in American AI technologies. 
Proposed Solution:  Establish the National AI Transparency Standard that requires:  
1Data provenance refers to the documented history of data, including its origins, sources, ownership, 
transformations it has undergone, and chain of custody throughout its lifecycle. Proper provenance 
documentation enables verification of data quality, identification of potential biases, and establishment of 
accountability within AI systems.  


 
2.1. Standardized documentation of performance boundaries and technical limitations  
2.2. Mandatory disclosure of validation methodologies and benchmark results  
2.3. Clear delineation of appropriate vs. inappropriate use cases based on technical capabilities  
2.4. Independent verification of key performance claims for high- risk applications  
 Alignment with National Priorities: 
● Strengthens America's global leadership in responsible AI innovation  
● Reduces national security risks through enhanced system understanding  
● Creates market advantage for transparent, well-documented American AI systems 
 
Measurable Outcomes:  
● 75% of federal AI procurements requiring transparency documentation within 18 months  
● 40% reduction in AI implementation failures in critical sectors within 3 years  
● Establishment of international transparency standards led by U.S. technical expertise  
 
Implementation Timeline:  
● Phase 1 (6 months): Template development through public -private partnership  
● Phase 2 (12 months): Implementation in federal procurement requirements  
● Phase 3 (24 months): Full integration with certification and regulatory frameworks  
 
SECTION 3: AI WORKFORCE AND KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT  
Recommendation 3: Establish Multi-Disciplinary Knowledge Integration Program  
Challenge:  Current AI development often relies on narrow technical expertise, creating systems 
that fail to incorporate a wide range of American knowledge domains and limiting AI application 
across critical sectors.  
 Proposed Solution:  Create the National AI Knowledge Integration Program that:  
3.1. Funds cross- disciplinary research teams combining technical and domain experts  
3.2. Establishes centers of excellence for sector -specific AI applications (healthcare, agriculture, 
manufacturing)  3.3. Develops specialized training programs to integrate domain knowledge with AI 
implementation  
3.4. Creates standardized frameworks for evaluating AI systems against domain -specific 
requirements 
 
Alignment with National Priorities: 


●Leverages America's diverse knowledge assets as competitive advantage
●Accelerates practical AI applications in priority economic sectors
●Expands AI workforce development beyond technical skills
●Supports the Administration's commitment to maintaining technological leadership
Measurable  Outcomes:  
●Establishment of 5 -7 domain-specific AI certification programs within 24 months
●25% increase in cross-disciplinary AI research publications within 3 years
●Creation of 10,000+ specialized jobs combining domain expertise and AI implementation
Implemen tation Timeline:  
●Phase 1 (12 months): Establish pilot programs in 3 priority sectors
●Phase 2 (24 months): Expand to additional 5 sectors based on evaluation results
●Phase 3 (36 months): Full implementation across all major economic sectors
SECTION 4:  INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
Recommendation 4: Develop AI Accountability and Remediation Framework  
Challeng e: The absence of clear accountability mechanisms creates market uncertainties, 
hampers American AI adoption, and exposes businesses to unpredictable liability, while 
allowing international competitors to establish competing standards. 
Proposed Solution:  Establish the American AI Accountability Framework that:  
4.1. C reates graduated tiers of accountability requirements based on risk levels  
4.2. Develops clear liability guidelines that promote innovation while ensuring responsibility 4.3. Establishes standardized incident response protocols for AI system failures 
4.4. Implements performance monitoring requirements for high- risk applications  
4.5. Creates certification programs for third -party auditors and verification experts  
Alignment with National Priorities: 
●Positions the U.S. as the global leader in responsible AI governance
●Creates predictable business environment that encourages innovation
●Establishes American standards as global benchmarks
●Supports the National Security Commission on AI recommendations
Measurable Outcomes:  
●80% of Fortune 500 companies adopting framework within 3 years
●U.S.-led standards adopted by at least 15 key international partners
●50% increase in AI investment in regulated sectors due to reduced uncertainty


 
Implementation Timeline:  
● Phase 1 (12 months): Framework development through multi -stakeholder process  
● Phase 2 (18 months): Voluntary adoption program with incentives  
● Phase 3 (30 months): Full implementation with international harmonization  
 Implementation Strategy  
Drawing from my experience coordinating multi-stakeholder programs and organizing community initiatives, I recommend implementing these policies through:  
1. Public-Private Implementation Councils for each major recommendation, modeled after 
successful federal advisory committees  
2. Phased Rollout Approach beginning with voluntary standards before transitioning to 
requirements  
3. Regional Innovation Hubs to ensure adaptation to local economic contexts and needs  
4. International Coordination Office  to align U.S. standards with key allies  
5. Continuous Evaluation Framework using data -driven metrics to assess implementation success  
 Economic and Security Benefits  
Implementation of these recommendations will yield significant benefits including:  
● Economic Growth:  Creation of 150,000+ new jobs in AI governance, implementation, and 
sector -specific applications 
● National Security: Reduced vulnerability to AI -based threats through enhanced understanding of 
system limitations  
● International Leadership:  Establishment of U.S.-led standards as global benchmarks  
● Innovation Acceleration: 35% increase in AI deployment across regulated industries due to 
clear guidelines  
 
Conclusion 
These recommendations provide a comprehensive approach to establishing American leadership 
in responsible AI development while ensuring robust safeguards against potential harms. By 
addressing data governance, technical transparency, knowledge integration, and accountability, 
this framework enables the United States to maintain its competitive edge in AI innovation while 
establishing global standards for responsible implementation.  
 America's continued technological leadership requires thoughtful policies that harness our 
strengths in innovation while addressing legitimate risks. These recommendations provide a 
practical path forward that supports American technology leadership in an increasingly complex
