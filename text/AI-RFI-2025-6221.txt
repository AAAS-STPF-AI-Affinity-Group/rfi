General Comment
I do not want m y intellectual property to be used for AI learning. If they get to use m y data and everyone else's data then this is
tantam ount to theft. You are stealing m y hard work and creations to profit from  it without m e knowing and without m y say. You can't have
it both ways. Copyrighting inform ation so others can't use, but give AI a pass to use everything. They should not be able to bypass
copyright for their AI training. That's not how copyright works. It should be the opposite. The AI can only train on data they have bought
or have been given perm ission to use.
If a person downloaded a book you wrote without paying for it then they can be fired or punished. But if an AI scrapes and downloads
the book, learning from  it and "understanding" it then that's ok? How is that ok? They used m y creation without m y perm ission to turn a
profit.
If I upload a picture I took on m y phone or a drawing from  m y tablet and a big com pany downloads it and uses it for them selves them  I
could sue them . But an AI scraping the data I uploaded shouldn't get punished? The AI is part of a big com pany and they shouldn't be
using m y creation.
Just because the data is on the internet doesn't m ean you can just call it your own. Just because it exists doesn't m ean it's yours. I learned
in high school and college that citing sources is extrem ely im portant. AI doesn't care about sources or who m ade the im age or writing.
They want to take whatever they can without paying people what they are owed.
