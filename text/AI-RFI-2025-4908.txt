General Comment
As an artist, I believe that the power of free enterprise is one of the things that m akes Am erica great. Our glorious m eritocracy allows
anyone with the skills in their own hands to m ake at least a little m oney as an artist.
OpenAI, ChatGPT, Dall-E, and other such program s were not founded on the m erits of their m akers- they were founded on the m akers'
ability to steal as m any copyrighted works as possible, as fast as possible. They relied on a gerontocratic Congress being too out of touch
and indifferent to pass regulation fast enough. Our great country, unfortunately, does not enforce the laws against theft when corporations
are stealing the work of private individuals.
If the "m akers" of AI insist that the "cost" of advancing their technology is the theft of stolen im ages, then m ake them  pay every cent for it.
You m ay not know who the individual artists on Pixiv, Bluesky, or DeviantArt are, ladies and gentlem en, but you sure as hell know the
New York Tim es. You know Penguin. You know Tim e m agazine. They've all had their libraries of work stolen. Force OpenAI to pay
them  back- that's an easy start. Let's see them  keep up with that cost.
Sincerely,
R. Garcia
