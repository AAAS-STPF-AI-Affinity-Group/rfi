I want us to harness the power of AI to solve problems - such as sourcing data from all over the 
world regarding cancer treatment so that cures can be found. If a doctor could input the situation of 
a particular patient and the AI could search all related and similar cases world -wide it could then 
plot the most likely successful course of treatment. As a photographer and writer I am concerned 
about the protections that should be in place to make sure Intellectual Property rights are also 
protected. Artists and creatives should have to Opt In. Currently, the process is set up so you have 
to Opt Out and the process is either difficult and burdensome or almost impossible. I believe we 
can create a balance that can accomplish both types of goals if planned caref ully and used 
properly.
