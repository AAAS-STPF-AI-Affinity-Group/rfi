General Comment
AI having unrestricted access to anything posted online is not only dangerous, but unethical. We are already seeing consequences of AI
such as copyright infringem ents and deepfakes of political figures, and giving AI the ability to learn from  an unrestricted pool of inform ation
will only speed up the rate at which new issues arise.
