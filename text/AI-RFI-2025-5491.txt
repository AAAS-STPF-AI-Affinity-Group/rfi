General Comment
AI is a garbage technology and all it does is enable talentless losers to steal from  people who actually put forth the effort to create
som ething great. AI needs to be heavily regulated and not used in the art spaces at all. No AI in m ovies, No AI in video gam es to replace
developers or actors, no ai m usic, no ai books, no ai writing. All it does is rob actual creatives and take away jobs from  real people who
actually want to do the thing ai replicates in a piss poor m anner.
