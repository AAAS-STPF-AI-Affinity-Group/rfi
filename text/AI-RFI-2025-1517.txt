General Comment
AI is here to stay that is true. But when som eone creates a piece of artwork, writing, anim ation, etc. They should have the right to
determ ine how that is used. If they want to participate in AI databases, so be it. If they don't so be it. The choice should always be up to
the user! Honor our copyright! Honor our hard work! Don't m ake stealing legal!
