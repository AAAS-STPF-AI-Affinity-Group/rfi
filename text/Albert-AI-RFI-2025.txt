AI is the death of art. You take all our heartfelt drawings, paintings, and writing, mix it up in a 
blender, and spew it out to make money. To be number one. You’re so focused on winning you don’t realize what you will lose. I understand that AI can sometimes be used for good, but it can also take away what makes us human. If you can just steal all of my art and writing that I worked so hard to create, what’s the point? Everyone just needs to get over AI and learn how to create things themselves. I’m so sick of it. I will never use AI to generate or create anything. I’d rather do it myself and fail.
