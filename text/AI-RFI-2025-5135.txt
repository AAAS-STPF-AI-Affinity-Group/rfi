General Comment
Generative AI is a threat to working Am ericans' livelihoods and has no place here. Copyright law m ust be protected and upheld to protect
people's creations so that com panies like OpenAI can't profit off of the work of others without com pensation. In addition to this,
generative AI will dilute the integrity of creative works and the spread of trustworthy inform ation if it is allowed to steal and scrape
whatever data the com panies/individuals who run them  want. The average Am erican does not want or need AI to m ake their lives better;
we are perfectly capable of that without it. The push for AI is overblown through the false narrative that it will m ake lives better when it
will actually steal straight from  Am erican pockets.
