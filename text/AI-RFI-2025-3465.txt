General Comment
While artificial intelligence has vast potential to affect the future, like all other technologies, without ethics that effect can only be negative,
disastrous, and irreversible.
Generative AI in particular is not true intelligence. It is a tool of theft and greed wielded by parties bereft of intelligence and creativity of
their own. Unfettered, genAI doesn't liberate art, it cannibalizes it, killing the very m inds that it feeds on until only its own m alform ed
m ockery is left.
And as it devours the creativity, talent , and livelihood of others - including and certainly lim ited to countless US citizens - denying them  no
only the recognition they deserve but also the futures they work for, it devours an untenable am ount of resources. The infrastructure
needed to power genAI at the scale being spoken of is literally consum ing the environm ent - including our country - in greed, draining our
resources, power infrastructure, and habitat. Those who claim  we are vulnerable without it are m erely the latest in a long history of grifters
and cheats who think only of lining their pockets with other people's m oney and have no com punction selling lies to do it - snake-oil
salesm en who think they can leave town once they've gotten what they can or when things get bad.
Don't let them  get away with it. Don't give them  what they want.
