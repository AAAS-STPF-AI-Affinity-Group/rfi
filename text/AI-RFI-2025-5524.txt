General Comment
So-called AI as offered by OpenAI and the like is founded on theft. Theft. Stolen work to teach a m achine to regurgitate, and the creator
of said work receives no paym ent for the tim e and effort that went into the work. This violates copyright law, fair use laws, and legality
aside, is destroying the planet. We don't need it. It's the equivalent to giving m onkeys a typewriter but with the added cost of an early
death.
