General Comment
Current AI direction is ridiculous. Creatives have taken a decade building up portolios online. Their incentive to create and post those
things on the internet is directly tied to m arketing for their businesses. And AI com panies can just vacuum  all of that up?
I can't m ake a car com pany by stealing car parts from  m y neighbors and re-assem bling the parts. If I can't afford to pay for a business
m odel, I don't have a business. Why is big tech exem pt from  that basic expectation?
Why do property rights m atter when google owns som ething, but not when Google steals som ething else to turn a profit on other people's
work?
Exem ptions to AI m eans an erosion of basic property rights for everyone. If you expect the com m on public to respect software
protections and other property rights these com panies enjoy after those sam e com panies rob us blind with governm ent perm ission, either
tacit or explicit, you're insane. 
If property rights don't' m atter, then they don't m atter. If they do m atter, stand up for them . Deny the ridiculous exceptions these m assive
com panies want to claim . AI developm ent does not m ean the sam e thing as investm ent in the generative AI system s these com panies want
to use to steal from  the creative m arkets, and when they say otherwise, they are lying to you.
