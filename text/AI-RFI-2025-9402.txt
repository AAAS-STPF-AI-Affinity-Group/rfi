General Comment
A private com pany should not have unilateral power to steal copyrighted work, least of all an AI com pany, which exists only to launder
m oney and m isinform ation. It is absurd we're even considering disenfranchising m illions of their livelihoods, and sets a catastrophic
precedent.
