General Comment
This plan is an overstep. We have had these rules in place to protect creators of all kinds throughout the growth of the US. Allowing any
AI to skirt those rules feels like a push in the wrong direction from  the core values of the laws we have in place.
The use of proprietary im ages and data has been skirted for years in the com ing of the internet age knowingly by perpetrators and
plaintiffs alike. It has been em braced as a "Any publicity is good publicity." 
Large corporations requesting access to data for free is beyond the scope of their AI projects knowing that sm aller AI structures have
accom plished far greater good with m uch lim ited scopes. This action plan as its called is a sham  for a hype fest around a series of
applications that have no directed purpose other than "Collecting Data."
As I use these products m ore and m ore in m y tim e I am  finding m yself seeking out the data presented through other m eans to m ake sure
what I'm  being presented is correct. I find it appalling that the use of these products is com ing at a cost of critical thinking. 
This push is as useless as the technology associated with the plan. The Artificial Intelligence Action Plan should not proceed.
