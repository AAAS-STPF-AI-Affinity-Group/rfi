General Comment
Enforce copyright on AI com panies, just like we do on everyone else. Property rights m atter, the US was FOUNDED on them .
Weakening copyright in this instance creates a laundering m echanism  for intellectual property. Maybe com panies think they want this right
now, but they'll be spitting nails when they realize som e random  AI com pany can now ingest their proprietary IP and spit it back out for
anyone who wants it. Once Boeing finds out people can ask OpenAI for its proprietary engineering plans and drug com panies discover
their form ulas being handed out, it's going to be too late to stick this genie back into the bottle. Other countries will be able to ignore US
copyright this way too. Think m ore than two seconds ahead of this, please. The entire US econom y depends on it.
