General Comment
AI is an overhyped and fleeting fad with no value that will be dead within the decade. It is exclusively trained via the theft of artists and
writers who create actual art with actual value. Allowing these people to legally steal from  others would be an insane m oral failure, and
frankly, em barrassing.
