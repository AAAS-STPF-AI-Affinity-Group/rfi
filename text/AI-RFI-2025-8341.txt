General Comment
AI generated crap has been used to plagiarize m y copyrighted works and force m e to file DMCAs all day and all night. LLMs and other
form s of generative AIs an environm ental hazard, they're stealing and m oney laundering art and writing from  m y fellow creatives who
NEED to m ake m oney off their work, they're wasteful, cheap, ugly, and add no value to the com m unity. There are practical uses of AI.
The AI m odels that are designed to analyze cancer cells and Nazcua lines in m iddle/south Am erica are OUTSTANDING uses of AI.
Chat GPT and other LLMs, however, waste environm ental resources by the bucketful just to write an em ail. Kids have been using it ins
school to avoid learning. Adults have been using it to avoid doing their jobs. The result is that people are relying on an unreliable tool and
accidents have been occurring left and right because people cannot understand that it is a m achine and not an incredibly intelligent person. 
LLMs are fundam entally a problem  in the creative com m unity, and if you want there to be art and writing in the future, it needs to be far
m ore restricted than it already is, because no one is capable of contributing to the world without fear of having their work stolen in
perpetuity.
