General Comment
Large language m odels (LLMs) as a technology have reached the peak of their usefulness. LLMs are very good at predicting sequences
of words, but that is c the extent of their capability. LLMs are not capable of reason, nor are they going to lead to better technologies.
The m oney being thrown at this technology is going to see fewer and fewer returns on investm ent. Further, there is no m odel that currently
generates a profit. These m odels cost m ore m oney to operate than they generate in revenue. Com panies developing LLMs depend on
frequent cash injections from  investors with no reasonable plan to recover those losses except the false prom ise that the technology will
becom e so ubiquitous that profits will be realized at som e unspecified tim e in the future.
It would be foolish to dism antle or underm ine intellectual property laws to prop up this dead-end technology.
