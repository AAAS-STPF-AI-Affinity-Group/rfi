General Comment
I do not believe that AI has a place in the future of the United States of Am erica. AI has proven tim e and tim e again that the results it
provides vary in accuracy and validity. Not only that, but the m ajority of AI m odels train off of stolen intellectual property of artists and
writers alike. AI is profiting off of theft. It is stealing from  the livelihoods of m illions of Am ericans.
