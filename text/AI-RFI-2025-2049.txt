General Comment
I don't believe that AI has any place or benefit in the future of Am erica. If anything, I believe it will contribute to it's struggles. We cannot
depend on AI to do everything for us, when we have the tools to do everything ourselves with m uch higher skill. AI is a threat to the
creativity of Am ericans.
