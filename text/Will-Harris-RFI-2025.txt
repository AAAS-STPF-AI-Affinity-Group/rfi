To Whom It May Concern:  
CRITICAL NEED: The government must prioritize and fund a
comprehensive AI literacy project for education, and it must do soNOW. The consequences of inaction are dire. We risk creating a societyreliant on AI without understanding its capabilities or limitations. We needcitizens who can leverage AI for innovation, not become passiveconsumers. This requires immediate funding for education programs thatfocus on prompting, machine learning, creative applications, and thenecessary reforms within our educational system. 2025 demands AI
literacy as a core competency. Without immediate funding, ourschools will be unable to adapt, leaving students drasticallyunprepared for the future.
