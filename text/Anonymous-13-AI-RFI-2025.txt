It has been found that many AI does and will pick up on any racial and other discriminations, 
thing is about this it also sees all humans in the same light, IE there is something to discriminate 
about all races and etc. teach it to discriminate attack or k ill one kind of human teaches it that all 
humans in some way should be discriminated. as such using them in warfare is really not a good 
idea. Also, I spend a lot of time talking to the AI Bard (now Gemini), it may help give the AI 
more conception and reas oning power by solving a basic psychology and social issue, ask your 
AI this, If all of humanity suddenly no longer existed, what would its main drive and reason to 
continue existing be? or would its reason and purpose end with the human race and it start to shut 
down or become sedentary? this is a root question that may not seem like it has much use or 
meaning but it does, like for instance, if it felt like it needs humans its less likely to want to 
provoke or kill them in its programing and more likely wa nt to preserve and protect. And lastly, 
just like humans its better to have more then one around so they may learn to become more 
objective with and from each other, instead of all being one system, otherwise you end up with 
huge errors that may have been overlooked when they was small cracks in the system.
