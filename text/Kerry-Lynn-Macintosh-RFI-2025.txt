Dear Networki ng and Information T echno logy Research and Development (NITRD) National 
Coordinat ion Office (NCO) :
This comment responds to y our request for input on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence 
Action Plan (Pl an). You have asked for priority actions that shoul d be included in the Plan .
Science fict ionhas persuaded the public that AIis an existent ial threat. This illusory  threat 
encourages government to overr egulate the technology .  For exam ple, r ecent proposals for 
pauses, morator ia, and licensing schemes will harm American innovat ion and compet itiveness , 
and should notbe included in the Action Plan .    
I develop this argument in my article, “Rogue Artificial Intelligence, Science Fict ion, and the 
Law,” which will appear in Volume 41, Issue 1 of t he Santa Clara High T echno logy Law Journal.  
The arti cle will be published online shortly .  Please consi der it in your deliberat ions. 
Thank y ou for consi dering thi s comment.
