Introduction 
On behalf of Anote and the Armor Institute, we are pleased to submit this response to the 
National Science Foundation’s Request for Information (RFI) on the development of an AI Action 
Plan . Our organizations share a mission to democratize artificial intelligence (AI) and strengthen 
the AI workforce. Anote is a human-centered AI company that helps enterprises extract 
actionable insights from unstructured data, while the Armor Institute is an AI education 
initiative that brings hands-on learning experiences to communities across the United States. 
We commend the NSF’s leadership in shaping a forward-looking AI strategy, and we offer the 
following recommendations to ensure the United States remains at the forefront of AI 
innovation, ethically  and competitively. 
AI Policy Recommendations: Accessibility, Workforce & Innovation 
To foster a vibrant AI ecosystem, we advocate for policies that support broad AI accessibility , 
robust workforce development, and dynamic private sector innovation , all underpinned by 
balanced regulation. Key recommendations include: ●Promote AI Accessibility and Democratization:  Federal policy should encourage the
development and dissemination of AI tools that are accessible to organizations of all
sizes and to underserved communities. This includes open datasets, open-source
frameworks, and affordable cloud AI resources, enabling startups, small businesses, and
researchers to leverage AI capabilities. By lowering barriers to entry, the NSF and other
agencies can ensure that the benefits of AI are widely shared across society.●Invest in AI Workforce Development: A national AI action plan must prioritize education
and training programs to cultivate an AI-savvy workforce. We recommend increased
support for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and AI curricula
at all levels, grants for AI-focused university programs, and vocational training for AI
skills. Workforce development initiatives should also emphasize retraining and upskilling
for current workers, so that America’s talent pool remains adaptable as AI transforms
industries.●Encourage Private Sector Innovation:  The federal government should continue to fund
and incentivize AI research and development in the private sector. Public-private
partnerships (such as NSF innovation grants and Small Business Innovation Research
programs) can accelerate breakthroughs by leveraging industry expertise. Additionally,
policies like R&D tax credits and streamlined technology transfer processes will spur
innovation, allowing companies like Anote to develop cutting-edge AI solutions that
drive economic growth.


●Ensure Balanced and Ethical AI Regulation:  We urge a balanced regulatory approach
that safeguards security, privacy, and ethical standards without stifling innovation.
Rather than one-size-fits-all regulation, a risk-based framework can set guidelines for
high-risk AI applications (for example, in critical infrastructure or human safety) while
permitting flexibility for low-risk uses. Collaboration between policymakers, industry
leaders, and academia is crucial to develop standards and best practices—such as
transparent AI systems, bias mitigation strategies, and cybersecurity protocols—that
build public trust in AI. With clear guidance and guardrails, companies can innovate
confidently, and society can reap AI’s benefits safely. Advancing AI Accessibility and Workforce Development 
Making AI broadly accessible and building a skilled AI workforce are central to Anote’s and the 
Armor Institute’s missions. Anote’s AI solutions  illustrate how advanced technology can be 
made practical and beneficial for enterprises, and the Armor Institute’s community initiatives 
show the power of hands-on education: 
●Enterprise AI Made Accessible (Anote): Today, an estimated 85% of enterprise data is
unstructured (such as text documents, emails, and reports) and often underutilized.
Anote’s platform addresses this challenge by using AI to rapidly classify text, extract key
entities and facts, and answer complex questions from large document collections. By
automating these tasks with accuracy and speed, Anote enables organizations to
uncover insights that would otherwise remain hidden, improving decision-making and
operational efficiency. Importantly, Anote’s human-centered approach means its AI
systems learn from domain experts and end-users, ensuring the technology is intuitive
and aligned with real-world needs. This approach helps businesses large and small to
adopt AI solutions without needing a team of data scientists, thereby democratizing
access to AI-driven analytics.●Community AI Education (Armor Institute): The Armor Institute expands AI literacy and
skills at the grassroots level. Through an expanding series of AI events, workshops, and
meetups in multiple U.S. cities, the Institute provides hands-on AI education  for
students, professionals, and enthusiasts. These events demystify AI through interactive
learning—participants get to experiment with AI tools, build simple models, and see AI
applications in action. By bringing together AI researchers, industry practitioners, and
community members, the Armor Institute’s programs foster inclusive engagement and
inspire local talent. Someone in a mid-size city can attend an Armor Institute workshop
and come away with tangible AI skills and a network of peers, which is critical for
building an AI-ready workforce beyond the traditional tech hubs. Such


community-centric education ensures that as AI advances, opportunities to learn and 
contribute are available to a broad cross-section of Americans. 
In combination, Anote and the Armor Institute exemplify how accessibility  and workforce 
development go hand in hand. Technology solutions like Anote’s make AI more usable and 
beneficial across industries, while educational outreach by the Armor Institute empowers 
people with the knowledge to use and create AI. We believe federal support for similar 
initiatives—scaling practical AI tools and community education—will multiply these impacts 
nationally. 
Collaboration with Federal Agencies and National AI Initiatives 
To fully realize the potential of AI, collaboration between government, industry, and educational 
organizations is essential. Anote and the Armor Institute recommend several avenues for 
working with federal agencies to enhance AI adoption, research, and governance: ●Public-Private AI Adoption Initiatives: Federal agencies can partner with AI solution
providers like Anote to pilot AI applications that improve government services and
operations. For example, agencies managing large archives of documents or data could
collaborate with Anote to deploy natural language processing (NLP) tools that extract
insights and improve public data access. Such pilot programs would not only enhance
agency efficiency but also serve as case studies for AI adoption in various sectors,
building confidence in AI technologies across the economy.●Joint Research and Funding Programs: We encourage NSF to expand funding for applied
AI research and to facilitate joint projects between academia and industry. As an
AI-focused company, Anote is eager to contribute to research endeavors (for instance, in
areas like NLP , human-in-the-loop learning, or AI ethics) alongside universities and
national labs. Initiatives such as the NSF National AI Research Institutes are excellent
models that could be extended or partnered with industry-led efforts. By co-funding
research and innovation challenges, the government can leverage private sector agility
and ensure research breakthroughs transition more rapidly into practical solutions.●Policy Development and Regulatory Sandboxes: The Armor Institute and Anote are
ready to share on-the-ground insights to inform effective AI policy. We suggest
establishing multi-stakeholder committees or advisory councils where industry experts,
researchers, and public representatives collaborate with policymakers on AI guidelines.
Additionally, the government might create “regulatory sandboxes” for AI – controlled
environments where companies can test new AI technologies or business models under
supervision. This approach would allow regulators to learn and adapt rules in step with


technological advances, ensuring that regulations remain adaptive, evidence-based, and 
supportive of innovation . 
●AI Training and Upskilling Partnerships: To address the nationwide demand for AI skills,
federal agencies (including NSF, Department of Labor, and Department of Education)
should partner with organizations that have training expertise. The Armor Institute’s
community workshops could be expanded or integrated into a larger
government-supported program for AI upskilling. For example, a federal grant could
enable free or low-cost AI bootcamps in underserved areas, delivered in collaboration
with institutes like Armor. Such programs should target a diverse audience — from
displaced workers seeking new career paths to public servants who need to understand
AI in their roles. Government investment in these training partnerships will cultivate a
larger, more inclusive pipeline of AI talent.●Support for Regional Innovation Hubs: We recommend the establishment of AI
innovation hubs across the country, where academia, industry, and government
intersect. These hubs (potentially building on NSF’s existing programs and partnering
with initiatives like the Armor Institute’s city-based meetups) would provide physical and
virtual spaces for experimentation, mentorship, and startup incubation. By seeding
regional centers of AI excellence — in areas ranging from healthcare AI to smart
manufacturing — the government can stimulate local economies and ensure that
AI-driven growth is distributed nationwide. Anote and similar companies can contribute
by mentoring startups or providing tools and datasets for hub participants, creating a
virtuous cycle of innovation and knowledge-sharing.Conclusion: A Vision for U.S. AI Leadership 
In summary, Anote and the Armor Institute strongly believe that a successful national AI Action 
Plan must blend innovation-friendly policy  with inclusive growth of skills and opportunities . By 
championing accessibility, investing in the workforce, encouraging private innovation, and 
embracing public-private collaboration, the United States can secure its position as a global 
leader in AI. We envision an AI future where American enterprises of all sizes harness data for 
insight and productivity, where workers continually upgrade their skills for the new AI-driven 
jobs, and where communities across the nation participate in the AI revolution. 
We appreciate the NSF’s consideration of our perspective. Anote and the Armor Institute are 
committed to advancing these goals and stand ready to collaborate on implementing this action 
plan. With continued leadership and strategic investment, the U.S. can foster an AI ecosystem 
that is not only cutting-edge and competitive, but also ethical, inclusive, and aligned with our 
national values. We look forward to working together to turn this vision into reality.
