Hello my name is Sarah Maul, I do not agree with the laws being changed so any AI company
can just use anything they want without agreements with those that own it. All this will do ishurt all sectors of our country and make anything stealable under the idea it's for AIgeneration. If protections are taken away this could make anything anyone makes from anycompany be able to be stolen without any legal ramifications. This will just hurt our countryand hurt our people more. As well make it so much easier for countries against us to steal ourstuff too. We do not need AI to be able to steal whatever it wants, what we do need is betterprotections against AI from taking things without asking the creators first. AI companiesshould not be given leeway to use anything without being asked since this could lead to aslippery
 slope of nothing being owned by anyone including our big companies so anyone
including other countries can just take what we have made.
