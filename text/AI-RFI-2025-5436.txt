General Comment
The dam  dem ands of Google and Open AI are patently foolish. China has significantlyâ€‹ stronger copyright protections, and yet Deep Seek
has utterly blown the pants off of the Am erican AI venture capital m arket. If we want to secure the future we need stronger protections
against AI com pany theft. Paying artists, writers, and other creators creates m ore content for the insatiable AI beast to consum e. AI is
already running out of data to train on. The way to protect Am ericas so called AI future is m ore m oney, and m ore subsidies to creators,
not to self-cannibalizing AI m odels that Google and Open AI freely adm it can't stop hallucinating com plete and utter bovine excrem ent.
