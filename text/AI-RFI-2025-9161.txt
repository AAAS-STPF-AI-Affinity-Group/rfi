General Comment
I have been working as a translator for m edia for over fifteen years, and over the last decade, the advent of AI translation has begun to
encroach on m y job prospects. Despite the fact that the work I do is difficult to do with AI, com panies are starting to attem pt to do
directionless m achine translation. It creates bad products that they seem  to think have no need for editing or review. They create products
that do not sell well because their quality is low.
Finally, the opening up of IP for free use for AI would be m et with a swift legal response by large com panies like Disney, who have
already seen the m arket on parodies of their IP grow. The fact of the m atter is that if copyrighted m aterials were not being used to train
these program s, they would not be able to recreate copyrighted im agery and Disney art styles.
