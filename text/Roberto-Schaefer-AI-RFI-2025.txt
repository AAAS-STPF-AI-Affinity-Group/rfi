The use of any AI, generative or not, MUST be strictly
regulated. The idea that the USA has to attain superiority overChina in the race for AI is grotesquely similar to the race fordomination of the mine shafts that Dr. Strangelove's characterexclaimed at the end of that satirical film from 1964! To beatthe Russians to the control over the mine shafts in the earth toprotect against the nuclear fallout that was about to happenwhen the US accidentally attacked he USSR with a nuclearbomb. 
 
There is an hysterical knee-jerk reaction by the entire currentadministration to have worldwide domination including theabsurd ideas of buying Greenland, annexing Canada as the521st state and controlling the Panama Canal, and that I fear isjust the beginning.
 
We must first protect our civil liberties from being strippedaway under the guise of fear of China overtaking us in the racefor better AI. And while they are proposing that theadministration has cozied up to the tech giants who donatedmillions to get the president elected. They are the ones whowant to loosen the protections for their own financial gainonly, not to be in the best interests of the people of the US. Thefederal government must not leave self-regulation as the guiderails to the implementation of AI which will decimate all ofour first amendment rights, privacy and more.It must be regulated by a department of the governmentfree from anyone or anything with a financial interest at


stake.
