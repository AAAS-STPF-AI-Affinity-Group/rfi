General Comment
To whom  it m ay concern,
I am  subm itting this letter today to urge the US governm ent not to subm it to the whim s of OpenAI and Google so they can m ake m ore
terrible and worthless AI projects. Am erica deserves better than to see its econom y tank because two conm en want to steal everyones
data for their useless AI m odels. 
Thank you,
A pissed of Am erican citizen
