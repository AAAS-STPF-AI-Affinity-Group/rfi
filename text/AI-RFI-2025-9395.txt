General Comment
This is the definition of both wastefulness and m adness. The very com panies pushing for this (OpenAI and its shareholders) routinely adm it
that their technology generates no value and consum es m ore resources than entire cities can provide. OpenAI and their ilk have already
plundered the entirety of the internet for their boondoggle, and only to produce an unfathom ably expensive and burdensom e system  of
confident lies and hallucinations. Their m achine has dem onstrated that its only use is for generating poisonous trash including libel,
dangerous legal and m edical advice, and fabricated pornography of unwilling subjects.
Unfettering these grossly irresponsible people, and their serially crim inal "industry", from  basic laws only em powers them  to intellectually
cripple the entire English-speaking world and further underm ine the very concept of truth. 
The only parties who stand to benefit from  this are a tiny class of ultra-wealthy technocrats and any craven politicians who beg at their feet
for scraps. If anything, the opposite course m ust be pursued: doing whatever is necessary to rem ove these corrupt actors from  the public
forever. No venture that claim s it can only succeed by stealing and lying and bribery should be rewarded for that behavior, least of all by
preem ptively excusing it for the sam e.
This nonsense is nothing but a blunt and childish attem pt to dodge criticism  of their awful conduct.
