General Comment
As the Lead Organizer of Raleigh Independent Gam e Developers, I feel that I have a responsibility to oppose the proposals set forth in
the action plan which would concern copyright infringem ent.
Sim ply put, sheltering AI com panies from  copyright infringem ent incentivizes them  to directly plagiarize copyrighted m aterial.
This copyrighted m aterial such as gam es, m ovies, m usic, television shows, and other m edia, represent trillions of dollars annually in the
global m arket. If Open AI is shielded, these investm ents will depreciate as the m arket is flooded with illegal copies.
It's very sim ple: Sam  Altm an has a financial incentive to lie about his intentions, and indem nification of any kind is inappropriate because it
would allow the wholesale theft of m y and m y client's valuable intellectual property
