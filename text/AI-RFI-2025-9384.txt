General Comment
The use of AI generators is unethical to the highest degree. As an artist, a writer, and a hum an with dignity I believe that we as individuals
all have the right to own and legally protect what we have crafted from  years of practicing skills, paying for program s and lessons and
degrees, and put our hearts, m inds, and passion into.
I can only hope that the governm ent is willing to understand the grave im plications that 'winning the ai race' has for the m illions of hum ans it
will harm  in its wake. 
Already these corporations have m ade it clear, and publically stated that their product cannot work without m ass theft of data taken
unwillingly from  Am erican citizens. Already we know that the power draw needed for these unthinking com puters to m ake guesses based
on scraped data and pixels is im m ense and harm ful to the environm ent and som e of the m ost vulnerable com m unities living here.
I beg for m y rights to the work I have m ade, and for the rights of everyone everywhere, and I will stand against the already unlawful and
unregulated use of the personal data of all Am ericans and all the world no m atter how or when this issue arises. There is no fair use if
consent was never even an option. There is no fair use if we cannot petition for the rem oval of our data from  generators.
Please, do not allow the draw of faulty tech to forever ruin the creative spark of our people, and the creative industries of Am erica.
