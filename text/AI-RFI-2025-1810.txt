General Comment
I have seen m any practices where AI can be used in a way that helps with tedious tasks. But none of these ever included training the AI
with im ages uploaded by the public. Transcription tools can be trained by the handwritten docum ents within an institution or im age
recognition where the picture taken by an underwater cam era of an ocean science institute to label sea life.
AI's that are being trained by public im ages have m ostly been used to deceive or scam  people. It is used to m ake AI content farm s and
low quality products that replace people, who would actually put effort into their work. 
That's why I think im age training should only be used with a specific goal and dataset. The users have to be able to choose if they want
their im ages to be used to train AI, because m any people post pictures of them selves, their children or living space and I think this critical
personal inform ation should not be used to recreate an sim ilar im age.
