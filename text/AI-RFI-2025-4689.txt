General Comment
Generative AI is destroying m y livelihood after having first stolen from  m y illustrations without m y consent. My illustrations and intellectual
property should never have been used in any step of the AI generation process without m y com pensation. I have worked m y whole life to
be skilled enough to m ake m y living and AI is taking that from  m e. I do not believe AI has the future in this country that these corporations
are claim ing it will, all in the nam e of their own profit. AI should not receive copyright carve outs that aide in destroying the lives of of /real
people/ by being allowed to freely use their creations and contributions to society.
