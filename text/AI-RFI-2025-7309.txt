General Comment
This cannot stand. I'm  a writer. My right to defend m y work, m y copyright is not a "unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ent" of the
country. It sickens m e that certain persons want to use the the hard work of others without their consent to produce low quality software
that is m eant to replace hum an m ade work, specifically the arts. A country that allows this to pass is not a country I am  proud of and not
one I want to live in. I am  deeply asham ed of the US that this act even exists in this form . You have to be a very sm all person to even
rem otely support this.
