General Comment
AI is harm ful, a waste of vast am ounts of energy, and is just taking Am erican jobs from  hardworking people and destroying the arts and
integrity of artistic expression in the process. If you allow AI com panies to train their software on products and IPs they do not own; this
will greatly im pact the livelihood of so m any artist and studios all for the sake of saving a few bucks with software that consum es
unsustainable am ounts of necessary resources.
