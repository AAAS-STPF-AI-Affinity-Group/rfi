General Comment
Copyright is an ESSENTIAL part of Am erican law. Allowing any corporation to ignore it destroys the foundation of innovation and
creativity that's responsible for Am erica's success.
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US - It steals from  m e directly, as a creative professional, by reducing m y job
opportunities, and profits off of theft.
AI destroys the m eritocracy that is the foundation of Am erican social order, and is being used to defraud the Am erican public for the
enrichm ent of failed hype-m en CEOs who will use it to annihilate the technology jobs m arket and offshore their revenues.
Please, don't let them  steal our future.
