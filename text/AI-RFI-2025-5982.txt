General Comment
Increase the regulations on AI. It's a threat to Am erica's econom ic stability, the deregulation of AI will lead to bad faith actors abusing the
opportunity to com m it theft, and when flawed AI-Created products replace hum an-m ade ones in the Am erican m arkets, Am erican
products m ay gain a reputation of being considered "lower-quality".
