General Comment
Hello sir, I do not approve of AI being given legal right to take art, voice or m aterial m ade by others without perm ission to use freely.
People have taken m uch tim e and effort into their work and deserve to not only be paid for it but not have their work stolen and used
without consent. 
Legalizing AI to this extent will not only put people who m ake a living creating art out of business but also it will m ock the effort content
creators, gam e designers, concept artist and other m eans of literature.
Please refuse to legalize and give AI this kind of power and protection. Thank you for your tim e.
