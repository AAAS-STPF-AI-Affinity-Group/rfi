General Comment
I strongly encourage the NSF to not relinquish their responsibilities to regulate the Artificial Intelligence industry. Although the industry
styles itself as developing artificial intelligence, I say as som eone who has studied artificial intelligence in cognitive science and cognitive
psychology coursework that these large language m odels are little m ore than prediction m achines. The program s add little to no insights on
what data is entered into them , and on the contrary often result in hallucinations and generalizations that m ake no sense to subject m atter
experts. It m ay seem  that these program s are close to m aking a breakthrough where they will be reliable, and indeed m any industry
leaders m ake outrageously rosy claim s about what their program s will be able to do, but there is no actual reason to believe that such a
breakthrough is close. Allowing these com panies to use data/m aterial without paying for it is theft. Allowing the com panies freedom  to do
this will only throw m ountains of valuable m oney and resources (water and land) into a pit. There is no reason to have faith that any of
these investm ents will pay off. Over-reliance on current LLMs is m uch m ore likely to lead to error and a stifling of ingenuity and creativity.
