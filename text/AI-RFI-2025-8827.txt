General Comment
Hello. I am  a writer, a journalist and a photographer, and have m ade m y living as such for m ore than a dozen years. If I were to steal
som eone else's work and incorporate it into m y own with no acknowledgem ent, I'd be guilty of plagiarism  and -- depending on what I
stole -- copyright violation. 
Yet the folks hocking so-called "artificial intelligence" are doing just that -- taking work like m ine, putting it into an overleveraged
calculator, and calling the result som ething new. 
This would be problem atic enough if these program s were actually doing som ething useful. But their tendency to hallucinate, to give
incorrect inform ation, is dangerous -- especially as they are m arketed as supposed "intelligence." Add to that the m assive energy
requirem ents and m onetary investm ents necessitated by supposed "AI" developm ent, and the need for serious regulation is crystal clear.
"AI" should not be subsidized by governm ent in any way, and serious regulations should be put into place governing any use of the
technology in transportation, healthcare, education, the legal profession, or any place where decisions can im pact life or death. 
Furtherm ore, the use of any copyrighted m aterial for the developm ent of supposed "AI" should require a licensing agreem ent with the
copyright holder.
