General Comment
The rem oval of guardrails for the developm ent and usage of AI opens us up to m any risks, but two in particular are concerning to m e.
First, an over reliance on AI can stifle hum an ingenuity and m ake us less com petitive. Studies have already shown a decline in cognition
caused by a reliance on these tools. Second, while there are effective use cases for AI (parsing large datasets, scanning x-rays for
tum ors), em bracing all form s of AI and sim ply allowing these com panies to scrape any data they want and generate any content they want
will effectively poison the well of hum an knowledge. In short, AI poses a threat to baseline hum an intelligence as well as our current store
of knowledge and inform ation.
