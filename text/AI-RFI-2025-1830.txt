General Comment
Any action or investm ent in AI m ust follow the copyright laws of this country.
Generative AI has proven itself to be a technology that steals from  artists, consum es vast resources including clean water, and produces
m ostly garbage work. A country that values its creative workers, its thinkers, and its hum anity would not invest in it.
But since we don't seem  to live in that country, I am  dem anding that copyright be respected and followed.
Don't steal m y stuff.
Signed,
Jessica LÃ©vai (she/her)
