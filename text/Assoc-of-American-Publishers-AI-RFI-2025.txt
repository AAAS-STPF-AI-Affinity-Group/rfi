INTRO DUCTION TO AAP AND THE AI PERSPECTIVES OF U.S. PUBLISHERS 
The Asso cia�on of American Publishers (AAP) is the industry representa�ve for book, journal, 
and educa�on publishers in the United States on legal and policy issues, including, especially, 
the fast -moving opportuni�es and challenges rela�ng to ar�ﬁcial intelligence.   
As a point of pride, the American publishing industry predates the founding of the United States and has been integral to its leadership and growth on the world stage for more than two centuries of technological advancement and global distribu�on, from the prin�ng press to the 
Internet.   
Unsurprisingly, the publishing industry is excited about,  inves�ng in, and using AI tools at this 
new and signiﬁcant moment for technology and content.  At the same �me, we are concerned 
about the equally cri�cal, long -term vitality of the na�on’s copyright laws, which have long been 
the founda�on of both crea�vity and innova�on in this country.   
We thank the White House for this opportunity to inform the President’s AI Ac�on Plan, which we believe can be a global example of how to protect and incen�vize creators and innovators alike, not only by responsibly advancing the poten�al of AI, but also by advancing marketplace licensing for crea�ve and intellectual content, based on strong copyright protec�ons that will 
con�nue to promote partnerships between the publishing and technology sectors.  
American publishers drive the most economically successful publishing market in the world, producing revenue of nearly 30 billion dollars annually in the United States alone.

part of the broader U.S. copyright industries, many of which produce news, educa�on, and

entertainment content based on books, and which collec�vely add more than $2.09 trillion in 
annual value to U.S. gross domes�c product.2 
America’s intellectual property (IP)  strength is what has led to leadership in AI and what will be 
needed to maintain that leadership. Advancing the na�on’s technological and economic agenda is not a zero -sum game. Dismantling copyright protec�ons will result in race to the botom that 
will not be  in America’s na�onal interest.  
In submi�ng these comments, we are proud to represent  large commercial companies that 
invest in and publish works of ﬁc�on and nonﬁc�on; digital companies that publish educa�onal materials across thousands of subject areas; small, regional, and independent presses that reﬂect and serve local communi�es;  and nonproﬁt research organiza�ons that inform and 
advance cri�cal developments in technology, science, and medicine.   
THE U.S.  AI ACTION PLAN  SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE  PROTECT ION OF  AMERICA’S GREATEST 
ASSET : INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  
As the White House develops its global- facing AI agenda,  we applaud its stated goals of ensuring 
safety,  advancing economic  compe��veness, and incen�vizing private sector innova�on.  
Against this backdrop, we believe that protec�ng intellectual property  should be a top priority 
for American  AI leadership, including, speciﬁcally, as to Genera�ve AI  capabili�es . 
Here are the major themes and sugges�ons by which the White House can promote AI leadership and protect American intellectual property:  
a.The United States can provide s ingular AI leadership by p riori�zing intellectual property
and AI t ogether .
Global AI leadership goes hand in hand with global copyright leadership.  Several countries have 
framed copyright protec�on as an impediment to AI development.  These countries do not have 
the IP markets of the United States.  By upholding U.S. intellectual property —including the 
copyright laws that protect and incen�vize the ongoing investments of publishers and authors — 
the United States can signal to other na�ons that they must not  weaken their own copyright 
laws . Were other countries to do so, they would be undermining American intellectual property 
exports and harming our  crea�ve industries.  At stake are the livelihoods of all creators who have 
helped to make the United States the leading voice on intellectual property in the digital age  
and who are integral to the future success of lawful AI products .

(IIPA)  (February 2025), htps://www.iipa.org/ﬁles/uploads/2025/02/IIPA- Copyright -Industries -in-the-U.S.-Economy -
Report -2024_ONLINE_FINAL.pdf . Beyond these important economic contribu�ons, an independent and thriving 
publishing industry supports the na�on’s poli�cal, intellectual, and cultural systems.  


Publishers invest signiﬁcant resources in bringing authors’ works to market —taking risks on new 
works from new and exis�ng authors. These investments are key to helping  Genera�ve  AI 
technologies produce safe and accurate  informa�on and con�nue to promote American ideals.   
b. Genera�ve AI owes its success to the i nvestments of p ublishers and a uthors : copyright
li�ga�on has been necessary to protect broad American i nterests and ideals globally, but the
White House has an o pportunity to p romote partnerships between American companies .
It is now well -known that Genera�ve AI was developed primarily by American technology 
companies using protected books and other media owned by American publishers and authors, 
regretably without regard to the usual rules of copyright commerce that require and are 
realized through uncomplicated licensing frameworks. These licensing frameworks are the basis of billions of  valuable  transac�ons involving crea�ve content across markets, represen�ng high -
quality  digital catalogs of American authorship.   
These unsanc�oned ac�vi�es by large tech companies have led to dozens of lawsuits involving 
copyrighted works, many of which focus on industrial scale infringement .
3 Claims of  
infringement includes situa�ons where tech companies violated basic paywalls and, worse, sourced their training materials from the unsafe troves of unscrupulous, notorious pirate sites . 
These sites include those  that have long been the targets of American oﬃcials seeking to 
protect our intellectual property from criminals, as explained further below.  
Publishers and tech companies have long been partners in American markets, and t he disregard 
by tech companies toward  content industries  with respect to AI  is unfortunate.  Nevertheless, 
the importance of sustaining the U.S. crea� ve industry  cannot be overstated, a point that even 
technologists have sounded with alarm.

American publishers inspire and inform the Na�on’s leaders, innovators, and future society.  
And, cri�cally, they  export American values, democra�c ideals , and culture throughout the 
world.  With respect to AI developers, publishers and authors are a much beter, safer, and 
lawful partner for AI services and tools than pirate sites, and licensing is a far stronger, 
economically advantageous, and symbio�c goal than li�ga�on.   
c.A vibrant licensing market con�nues to evolve  between publishers and AI developers, and
the White House should embrace and e ncourage it.
Licensing helps feed  copyright commerce worldwide for American creators.  It incen�vizes 
crea�vity and  support s con�nued investment in new human- created works  and the robust 
informa�on economy we enjoy today . Licensing also produces cri�cal beneﬁts for AI developers: 
it incen�vizes data collec�on and cleaning, it fuels investment in producing the next genera�on of high- quality training materials, and it enables startups and market entrants to compete on 
factors other than the ability to  collect  the most  data.  
Even as some tech companies have proposed policy posi�ons that cri�cize  licensing, they are 
simultaneously licensing works from publishers and other media companies.  At the end of the 
day, publishers and other copyright owners are uniquely posi�oned to authorize AI developers to use accurate, high -quality catalogs of books, research journals, and other valuable 
intellectual property for training, materials that are fr ee from damaging, unsafe elements of the 
dark web.  Such licensing deals are a win for AI development and IP investment alike.  Licensing is 
also a minor expense f or AI companies that are now worth hundreds of billions of dollars .  
New licensing and access agreements are constantly evolving . These include major deals 
between book publishers as well as news publishers, and some, but by no means all, have been 
reported in the press.
 5 Such agreements are a win -win for the United States . Professional and 
scholarly publishers already license their databases for text and data mining ( TDM ) uses,6 and 
have been leaders in forging AI deals for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.7

d.The White House m ust reject Big Tech’s  calls for sweeping excep�ons to copyright,
including a bloated fair use defense and an unworkable “opt -out”  regime, which would
dismantle  centuries of c opyright law and d estroy evolving l icensing markets  and future IP
investment .
The U.S. will not become the global leader in AI by abandoning  the fundamental principles of 
free markets and property rights that ha ve fueled  its success.  Copyright law secures the 
property rights of creators, allowing them to nego�ate with others on mutually agreeable 
terms.  As the Supreme Court has said, “By establishing a marketable right to the use of one's 
expression, copyright supplies the economic incen�ve to create and disseminate ideas.”8 The 
ability of authors and publishers to opt in  to new uses and new markets —or to decline them— is 
what makes a copyright a copyright.9 
There is no precedent under fair use case law that supports  the wholesale copying of millions of 
copyrighted works to build commercial services that compete in the same markets. Fair use 
allows courts to permit on a case -by-case basis narrow uses of copyrighted works that do not 
harm the copyright owner’s interests. It was never intended to sanc�on unvarnished the� for 
commercial technology products.  Rather, the value chain starts with authors and publishers and 
requires permission, the way all other digital uses are  transacted in the copyright marketplace 
today.  
In contrast to the exclusive rights protected by  copyright,  an “opt -out” regime , also referred to 
as “rights reserva�on ,” ﬂips the �me -tested logic of property on its head, allowing large tech 
companies to expropriate  the value of copyright owners without consent unless they are told 
otherwise.  The burden on copyright owners to no�fy AI developers of whether a copyrighted 
work may be used for training would be sign iﬁcan t—not to men�on  the fact that it would be 
diﬃcult, if not impossible, for authors and publishers to even know  when their works are being 
used by AI developers in the ﬁrst place . It is telling that some six years since the European Union 
adopt ed its Directive on copyright and related rights in the digital single market,10 which allows 
rightsholders to opt -out of a TDM excep�on , there is s�ll no consensus regarding what qualiﬁes

principles of copyright law, the most important of which is that authors and publishers have the right to control the 
terms of their intellectual property —includi ng whether it may be used in the ﬁrst place and, if so, under what 
condi�ons. ”).

relevance.) Document 32019L0790.  


as a valid opt -out mechanism.  Such schemes  are contrary to  interna�onal trea�es on copyright 
protec�on, which prohibit governments from burdening authors as to the enjoyment and 
control of their rights and equally prohibit sweeping excep�ons for users.11 In short, an “opt -
out” regime  would devalue intellectual property, s�ﬂe investment in crea�ve industries, and 
disrupt quickly evolving  licensing markets . 
The White House should thus reject proposals that lets Big Tech  ignore copyright protec�ons 
either through unprecedent expansion of fair use or unworkable “opt -out” regimes . To further 
safeguard American compe��veness, it should  urge  other countries to follow our lead in 
upholding strong copyright protec�ons and reject s imilar misguided proposals . 
e. Pirate s ites are a c riminal scourge on IP investments  of the United States; the White House
should denounce AI d evelopers who s ource their t raining materials  from pirate sites and
nullify incen�ves or beneﬁts it might otherwise oﬀer to  AI developers .
Internet pirate sites have long been a scourge on American investments in intellectual property 
and o�en  couple their IP the� with other criminal ac�vi�es beyond the jurisdic�onal reach of 
U.S. law enforcement.  It is well established  that many founda�onal AI models have been trained 
on copyrighted works illicitly obtained from pirate repositories.  Many of the se pirate sites have 
long been iden�ﬁed by  the U.S. government as notorious agents opera�ng against U.S. 
interests12 and targeted by U.S. law enforcement.13 
As the White House drives AI leadership, the country has a pivotal opportunity to  strengthen its 
opposi�on to pirate sites and  denounc e the use of pirate repositories to create AI training 
datasets . Such conduct is clearly illegal, risks prolifera�on by other countries, and serves as an 
obstacle to the private sector’s ability to innovate in AI.14

Foreign AI companies have also used pirate repositories to expropriate the value of American 
copyrighted works. For example, DeepSeek researchers have publicly acknowledged that they used content from Anna’s Archive (a site that aggregates records from maj or shadow libraries 
like Z -Library, Sci- Hub, and LibGen) to train at least one of its models .
15 The U.S. should 
aggressively pursue  ac�ons against these sites and unfriendly pirate jurisdic�ons.  
Pirate  repositories compound the challenges already  caused to copyright owners from 
infringement arising out of the unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train AI models. The 
availability of copyrighted works on the black market undermines the nego�a�ng leverage of copyright owners  in the new AI markets.  Moreover, the  illicit distribu�on of copyrighted works 
eliminates the ability of copyright owners to employ technological measures to mi�gate unauthorized training, and the use of pirate repositories by mainstream companies improperly normalizes commercial- scale piracy, contrary to clear U.S. law enforcement objec�ves 
worldwide . 
Recommenda�ons  
•Denounce the training of AI models on pirate sites and content and nullify any incen�ves
or beneﬁts that would otherwise ﬂow to such AI developers from the U.S. government.
•Direct agencies to prohibit the procurement and use of AI models that have been trainedon pirate sites  and content when contrac�ng for AI services.
•Employ law enforcement and trade tools to combat pirate repositories which allowforeign compe�tors to illegally expropriate American intellectual property.
•Direct the DOJ and FTC to use their unfair compe��on authority against companies  that
use and support  pirate repositories for training.

f.Transparency as to t raining materials is essen�al  to fair and s afe AI policy, and the White
House should work with Congress to priori�ze U.S. n eeds and  harmonize  transparency
requirements worldwide .
Transparency is an essen�al component for promo�ng accountability and building public trust in 
AI technologies and in the products and services into which AI technologies may be embedded. 
Speciﬁcally with respect to the use of copyrighted works to train Genera�ve  AI systems, 
accurate record -keeping and appropriate disclosure of copyrighted works incorporated into 
training datasets will provide rights holders with a mechanism for learning when their works 
have been used without authoriza�on.  
Such a requirement is not burdensome and lends itself to further innova�on in the ﬁeld of digital rights enterprises. Stakeholders in the AI space are already subject to repor�ng 
requirements for privacy laws, for instance, and do not dispute their ability to comply with the extensive exis�ng repor�ng requirements for privacy laws.  
Where licensing is occurring, and as licensing models evolve, accurate record keeping of how and which copyrighted works are used to train genera�ve AI systems may provide the mechanism through which revenue sharing models may be deﬁned.  
A transparency requirement is also essen�al to determining the provenance of the content of the training datasets used to develop and train a genera�ve AI model, which builds trust  in the 
model’s outputs . AI systems developed or trained on works derived or created from authorized 
sources are more likely to yield reliable outputs than works obtained from pirated or illegal sources. It is essen�al to trustworthy and reliable AI that developers u�lize high  quality, curated 
content from legi�mate sources to create training corpora for their models. For example, in the 
case of AI training based on professional and scholarly communica�on, it is important that AI developers use only the  Version of Record (VoR) of an ar�cle or report (appropriately licensed, 
of course). The VoR is the ﬁnal, publisher -maintained ar�cle, updated, and archived con�nually 
in consulta�on with the author. Accepted manuscripts, pre -prints, or illegally uplo aded text 
versions of the ar�cle may be subject to post -publica�on modiﬁca�on or retrac�on, and the use 
of the uncorrected version could create serious and cascading scien�ﬁc or medical errors in AI generated outputs.  
Beyond the economic impacts felt by industry, transparency requirements are necessary to verify that high quality, peer reviewed, veted material are used to create training datasets given that AI technologies are integrated into applica�ons that will impact the lives and well- being of 
individuals, whether ﬁnancially, physically, mentally, academically, or professionally. 
Transparency requirements will lend assurance that the output of the genera�ve AI system 
trained on such veted content is both reliab le and trustworthy.  
Recommenda�ons  
•Lead global transparency requirements and harmoniza�on.


•Direct federal agencies to include transparency requirements from AI developers when
contrac�ng for AI services.
•Lead and support legisla�ve solu�ons requiring appropriate record -keeping and
disclosure requirements from AI model developers.
CONCLUSION  
On behalf of the American publishing industry, we thank the White House for invi�ng comments 
to inform its AI Ac�on Plan, and we look forward to working with all parts of the Administra�on and the Congress to ensure that the United States remains a lead er on both AI and IP 
investments and societal beneﬁts.
