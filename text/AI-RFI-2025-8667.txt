General Comment
AI as it is currently envisioned, is nothing m ore than a tool to claim  the work of artists (upon which all these system s have been trained,
without credit or recom pense for any of the artists involved.) its also a tool to deprive working artists of the possibility of future work. It
looks appealing to executives but it does nothing other than im poverish. It rem oves hum anity from  the m aking of art.
