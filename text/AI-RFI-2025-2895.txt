General Comment
Generative AI from  corporations such as OpenAI and DeepSeek have no place in the future of the US.
These com panies will scrape data not just from  public sources, but closed sources as well.
Allowing OpenAI unrestricted access will allow them  to collect data from  classified docum ents and nodes, putting our national security at
risk.
Our dem ocracy has already been com prom ised twice.
Cam bria analytics in 2016 and in 2024 with generative AI political ads.
If you truly support freedom , you will not let this pass.
