General Comment
With all due respect, OpenAI's attem pt to subvert the law by claim ing they should be allowed to ignore copyright "For Am erica to
Dom inate the AI Sector" is com plete and utter garbage. If the United States Governm ent decides to sim ply ignore Copyright Law
because they can, then every single person who had m oney confiscated by the very sam e Governm ent DESERVES to be paid back with
interest, otherwise why obey laws at all. It's either Laws for All, or Laws for None.
