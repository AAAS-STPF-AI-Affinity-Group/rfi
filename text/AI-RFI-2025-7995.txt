General Comment
I’m  an artist who relies on the protection of intellectual property. I have already seen peers decide to give up posting their work online. I
have peers who teach at art schools say kids are disheartened about pursuing the arts because of AI. I’m  not alone in being sick of AI
clogging search engines. It’s ruining the Internet. It destroys the environm ent and jobs. It uses m ore energy than it’s worth. I understand
the benefit of using AI to detect things like cancer cells but its usefulness elsewhere is overblown.
