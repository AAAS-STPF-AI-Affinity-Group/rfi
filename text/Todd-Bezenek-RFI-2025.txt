I hold BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering (focus on machine learning, 1993) and 
computer sciences (focus on computer architecture, 2001) and I am likely going to become 
homeless along with my wife. There are many homeless people in the USA, many o f whom are 
good people, but may not have the educational background that I have. Machine learning (AI) 
technology and it's ease of use in accessing archived information and expressing it in an easy to 
digest form using large language models represents a wa y to get those who have no usable skills 
working again. I would like to see the Trump Presidency find a way to leverage unused US 
Citizen workers to advance the goals of the wealthy in the USA instead of importing more talent 
via the H-1B program. Sincerel y, Todd M. Bezenek, E.I.T.
