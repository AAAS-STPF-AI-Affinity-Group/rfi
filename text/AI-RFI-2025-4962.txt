General Comment
Many AI program s train their m odels on copyrighted m aterials, illegally. In doing so it steals peoples protected creations, and uses it
without the creators perm issions. There needs to be action taken to ensure the protections of peoples creations, as it wont just effect the
big com panies, but individuals rights as well. There needs to be plans in place to ensure that AI cannot be trained using copyrighted
m aterials, and stealing peoples data.
