General Comment
Artificial Intelligence needs to be regulated and closely m onitored to respect the public's livelihood. Artificial intelligence has proven on
countless occasions that it is incapable of respecting the creative rights of the people through generative artificial intelligence services that
wrongfully scrape works for their services while artificial intelligence-based services that attem pt to relay inform ation such as those used in
Google's AI overviews have proven to be unable to relay accurate inform ation to users, which has the potential to push false beliefs.
