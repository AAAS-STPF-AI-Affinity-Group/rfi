General Comment
AI is currently a tool used by big organizations to grind up sm all people and use them  for their own m eans. As an Am erican citizen I do
NOT support the current trajectory of AI developm ent. Its use in all fields, but especially creative ones, needs to be regulated both in
accordance with existing laws regarding copyright and consum er protection, as well as additional considerations for how it will negatively
im pact people when it hallucinates incorrect inform ation.
If any sort of action plan is put in place, I would prefer for funding and research to be done on how to protect Am erican citizens from
having their rights violated by users of AI. This is especially true of how our data should be protected from  foreign com panies. Stronger
data privacy laws should be put in place to protect us from  being spied on by m alicious actors.
