General Comment
Dedicating Am ericas infrastructure to AI is going to cripple our power grid for the sake of pile of fools gold. Do you rem em ber NFT's?
Do you rem em ber Zuckerburg claim ing he was going to bring about a Matrix style VR world revolution? 
Do you rem em ber beanie babies?
Do you rem em ber the Tulip Bubble?
The Am erican econom y is already being ham strung by the dum best trade war this country has ever seen and on TOP of this, you want to
dum p all of our rem aining resources into som ething that uses up the sam e energy as entire cities to create the ugliest art, the m ost broken
code, the m ost poorly written literature, the m ost inaccurate data it can. 
AI is a snake oil that has em pty headed executives convinced it can replace m illions of artists, writers, program m ers, researchers, and
journalists. It can't, but the people with the m ost stock invested in AI as a whole are paying good m oney to convince them  it can. In the
m eantim e m illions of Am ericans will be put out of work for the sake of half baked garbage outputs and our electricity bills and water bills
will skyrocket because of the dem and the servers running this nonsense. 
When utilities costs skyrocket, silicone valley runs out of drinkable water, and the unem ploym ent rate balloons out of control I will
personally be breaking down the door of EVERY politician who allowed this to happen. 
Fix this. Now.
