General Comment
AI program s are unreliable and are being used for predatory m eans across everything. using only or any form  of AI system s/software can
lead to m ore trouble then you think good. Short term  profit be there but it will quickly evaporate, if its given full access and no regulations
or under any laws to stop it.. i beg of you along with thousands of people.. do not GRANT THIS OPEN AI FULL UNLIMITED
ACESS. 
Greed is the DEATH for ALL.
