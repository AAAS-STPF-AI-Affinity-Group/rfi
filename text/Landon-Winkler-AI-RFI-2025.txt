When charting a path forward with AI, it’s vital to honor the rights belonging to the creators and owners of existing
works. Training an artificial intelligence on a copyrighted work is creating a derivative work, which should gothrough the channels of normal licensing.
Like many small business owners, that intellectual property is the primary asset of our business. Allowing it to be
used without agreement or compensation is a direct breech of our rights as creators and owners.
I am sympathetic to the AI industry’s desire to ignore everyone else’s property rights and train their creations for
free. Everyone would like a special exception to monetize derivative works without even contacting the creators ofthe originals. However, allowing one class of creator full permission to loot the works of others will only depress thevalue of everyone's work and destroy the jobs that can be built on that.
While propping up the nascent AI industry, it’s important not to undercut the creative industries where America is
already the best in the world. It’s simply not worth it to gamble on a few tech startups.
In short, training artificial intelligence on copyrighted works should require the express permission of that
copyright’s owner.
Thank you for your time,
Landon Winkler
