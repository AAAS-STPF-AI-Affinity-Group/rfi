General Comment
I do not believe that allowing AI com panies to freely steal and infringe on the copyright of artists around the globe unpunished is even
rem otely a good idea. Ever since its birth it has done nothing good but be a glorified theft m achine that constantly serves wrong answers
on the front page of Google. No am ount of "further refinem ent and tweaking" will m ake it the dream  program  they prom ise it to be if it
can't even slightly deliver that now.
Do not screw over the lives, jobs, and hobbies of artists around the world. Do not allow the theft and crim e to continue unadulterated. Do
not let this plan pass.
The whole world will suffer for it.
