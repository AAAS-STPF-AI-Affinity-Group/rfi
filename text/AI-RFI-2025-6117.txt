General Comment
Copyright built the creative and innovation econom y that we have enjoyed for centuries. AI trained on copyrighted m aterial is theft. If AI
can’t exist without stealing from  everyone, they shouldn’t exist. We can force them  to train their AI ethically but theft is their business
m odel.
I urge you to force stronger regulations to protect hum an inventors and artists.
