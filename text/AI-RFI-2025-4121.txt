General Comment
As an artist and writer, I strongly oppose the intellectual theft and exploitation of hum an creators that is essential for all AI platform s to
function. Until this is m eaningfully addressed and creators can share their work without fear of non-consensually contributing to these toxic
and extractive business m odels, I will withhold all support for and willing participation in or contribution to AI. 
PROTECT PEOPLE, NOT PROGRAMS.
