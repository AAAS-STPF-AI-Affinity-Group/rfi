General Comment
This plan will allow for unfettered control by a single com pany of copyrighted m aterials for its own gain to generate profit without properly
com pensating the parties from  which it has taken data from . This will give im m unity to business like OpenAI from  any legal challenge to
their potentially illegal use of copyrighted m aterials including news publications, books, academ ic and scientific journal publications, audio-
visual m edia, and online publications not strictly defined by these definitions.
This seem s to have the additional purpose to elim inate any legal punishm ent to OpenAI and other com panies so that a virtual m onopoly on
theft of copyrighted m aterials can be given to these com panies, who can then operate with im punity.
