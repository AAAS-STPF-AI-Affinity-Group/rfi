General Comment
AI would be im m ensely detrim ental for any Am erican who creates. This is why I oppose it and this action plan.
Generative AI scrapes through sources and peels ideas from  them  to m ake its creations, and the sources it scours are privately owned.
With every AI generated im age, it steals m aterial from  m any Am erican-m ade works of art, thereby depriving Am ericans the com pensation
they rightly deserve. Any hum an who did this would be charged with theft m any tim es over and be sent to prison.
AI profits off of lazy theft. Instead of hard-working Am ericans getting paid for their work, they would get their livelihoods ruined while a
m achine spews som e creation out for its rich owner. This is plainly un-Am erican and it should not be considered.
This is why I oppose this action plan and urge those in charge to reconsider.
