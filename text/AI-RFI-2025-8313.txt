General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the world.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an artist and profits off of theft of intellectual property and creativity that is developed over a lifetim e.
AI is overused and intellectually dishonest.
AI is being pushed by the laziest and m ost feckless am ong the populace who only want the prosperity and accolades that go along with
being seen as a creative.
You don't allow people to steal property. Intellectual property is STILL property.
