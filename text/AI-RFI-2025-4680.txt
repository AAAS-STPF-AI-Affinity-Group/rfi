General Comment
The "barriers" you wish to rem ove are people's rights. There is no ethical use of generative AI. It is theft, it is destroying the planet, and I
refuse to accept it as norm al and acceptable. Am erica's investm ent into AI was a failure, and the citizens overwhelm ingly do not want it
integrated into everything. Listen to your citizens and say NO to using, funding, and supporting AI.
