General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica, it is full of failures, theft, disgusting abuse of ethics and m orals, a huge strain
on resources, and at the end point still needs hum an intervention and correction.
It has shown to be incorrect and inconclusive in several very sim ple and very vital areas, such as m athem atics, which we already have
basic and rudim entary m echanics for.
It has been used to abuse the workforce, elim inate em ploym ent, and blatantly steal from  hard working creative m inds. It's an absolute
insult to the world of art, the realm  of technology, and an actual threat to hum an im agination and health.
Discard it entirely, and im m ediately.
