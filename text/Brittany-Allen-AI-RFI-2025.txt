I believe that unrestricted development in the AI sector will harm many Americans and
businesses alike, while only  enriching a few wealthy individuals.
Americans have long used copyright protections to ensure that innovators, artists, and writersare properly compensated for their work and continue to develop their craft. If AI is allowed tobe freely trained on copyrighted
 material, then it is stealing the work of everyone who helped
build up the fields of the arts and sciences. An individual may not freely take the copyrightedwork of another for the sake of profit, so I do not see why a large company should be allowedto do so.
AI companies have posed the development of AI as a national security matter, but it is solely a
business matter. They are trying to use the fear that China might develop better AI faster tobypass regulations. This new "tech arms race" will likely create many of the same problemsbrought on by the nuclear arms waste. Both are dangerous, environmentally polluting, andhave little use to the average American.
The government should resist the pressures of the tech industry to grow at a cancerous rate. By
resisting these pressures, the government can better protect the American people.
