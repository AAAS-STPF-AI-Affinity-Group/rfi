General Comment
I stand againest AI in all form s, and rem oving the "guardrails" of copyright is an inherently profit driven and anti-artist action. Am erica does
not need AI to be exem pt from  copyright for it to useful in m atters of nation security, Am erica doesn't need AI to replace the Artists who
have captured and spread our culture since the dawn of this nation, Am erica does not need a com pany stealing art from  it's creatives to
further it's own ends. enough with the colorful words do not pass this.
