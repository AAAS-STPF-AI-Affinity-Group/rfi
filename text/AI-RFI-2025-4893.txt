General Comment
OpenAI is a com pany whose entire business m odel is based on the ingestion of copyrighted m aterial in order to distribute derivative
works based on that copyrighted m aterial. Their attem pts to stretch the fair use clause of the DMCA is analogous to a high school student
taking the words of an accom plished writer wholesale and swapping out a few choice words to m ake it "their own." Allowing OpenAI to
run ram pant through the artistic history of Am erica and the World would be utterly disastrous for all creative econom ies. Art would be
com pletely devalued to the point of no return and entire econom ic ecosystem s will inevitably collapse if they are allowed to m ove forward.
End this nonsense and protect Am erican artists, m usicians and writers from  this blatant theft and plagiarism  disguised as "leveling the
playing field."
