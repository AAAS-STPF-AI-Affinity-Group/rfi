AI has the potential to be the best thing that has ever happened to some people when used to help 
people and it has the powntial to be the worst thing that has ever happened to other people when 
used to do bad things. The aviation industry uses a process c alled a System Safety Assessment. 
That process has created a method of travel that is the safest in the world. The Safety Assessment 
Process can be used for any system that has the potential for safety risks. Please consider using 
this process to make AI a s safe as practical for the public.
