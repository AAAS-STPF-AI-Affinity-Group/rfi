General Comment
Generative artificial intelligence destroys jobs for the citizens of the United States. As an artist, m y security in m y field is threatened, and
not only that, but those careers of m y friends and fam ily rem ains on the line. With the com bination of the push of AI, and the recent cutting
of funding of long standing pillars of our com m unities, where do those skilled workers turn to? I would love to live in a world where
m achines can do undesirable jobs, but AI is replacing arts and hum anities, fields that have hum ans who love the work that they do. True
artists do not hate m aking art, so why replace them ? So that business can m ake m ore m oney? When did our country becom e a place that
only cares for corporations, and not the individual? 
This is not to m ention the horrific environm ental im pact AI has. Our clim ate has been destroyed enough. Is the U.S. truely on the right side
of history?
