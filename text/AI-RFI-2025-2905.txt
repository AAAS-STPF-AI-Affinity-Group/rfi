General Comment
Generative Artificial Intelligence and sim ilar operations that use unauthorized m aterials for learning are a threat to the Am erican econom y,
and to the confidence of the Am erican people. If we cannot have the exclusive rights to our own m aterials, we m ay cease m aking and
sharing these altogether (as has already begun with the "dying internet" theory), rapidly erasing Am erican culture from  the internet and even
from  the m edia altogether. Furtherm ore, these tools have incredibly dangerous consequences for adults and children alike. AI is
increasingly used to prey upon the individual for pornographic content without consent. What we need are *stricter* laws and
punishm ents to address the abuse of privately-owned m edia. We should NOT be relaxing them . Finally, the AI cycle is a rapidly-
degrading one. We know for a fact that AI does not only learn from  original content, but from  its own content that is often m ass-produced
and published. This leads to a deterioration in art, in writing, in creative m edium s as a whole. There are a lot m ore problem s both niche
and wide-spread to give consideration to. But the fact is this: The Am erican people deserve the exclusive right to their creations and how
they m ay be used. This is a cornerstone to our culture and our m eans of capital. Machines will never be as great as the Am erican creative.
It's tim e to end this.
