I write as a concerned citizen. In the midst of all of these actions stripping Americans of their
rights, putting whole classes of people in danger, and wiping out a once thriving economy, thisAI Action Plan would be yet another absolutely awful move on the part of the federalgovernment. AI companies must not be allowed to steal from the creative works of everyhuman being, to base their "growth" and "profits" - if they ever truly achieve these - on thecollective works of people who will gain no benefit but the continued burning of our planet inpursuit of the next innovation. We can and must do better.
