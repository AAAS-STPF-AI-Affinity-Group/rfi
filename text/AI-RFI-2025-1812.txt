General Comment
This is theft, pure and sim ple. For decades, over a century even, com panies in the US have argued that we m ust pay for their m ovies, their
books, and their software because they paid the collective people who created them  and it was im portant to not only get back their
m oney but m ake a profit. People have been fined and jailed for piracy. 
This allowance of access to hum an labor for free to AI would com pletely upend the econom y. It is anti-capitalist without creating a safety
net for those creative people the com panies are stealing from  (so how are they going to to afford to buy their products). It is anti-social in
that it legalizes the theft of work of large m asses of people without paying by m assive corporations. And it is anti-Am erican in that it
signals the decline of the US strength as a leader in global culture, when our governm ent would give it away for nothing to a collection of
com puters at the expense of its own people.
