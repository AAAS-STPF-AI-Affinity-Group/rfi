General Comment
Many of m y friends m ake their living m aking art, anim ating, and using their voices in order to get any sort of incom e. The last few years
have shown that com panies are willing to subtract genuine care and originality over m indless slop that hurts those looking for an incom e in
the work industry. AI needs to be regulated, and allowing com panies like google to use their tech to siphon through god knows how m uch
content in order to leech off of others, and those having no say or control in it is absolutely disgusting and shouldn't be allowed.
