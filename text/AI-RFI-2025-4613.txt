General Comment
I think that this action to give com panies m ore broad access to content to train AI is a bad idea. There are som e facets of Generative AI
that com panies would rather the governm ent overlook. For GenAI, this includes learning from  copyrighted works such as but not lim ited
to artists around the globe, and these artists are not being fairly com pensated in the construction of this tool. Other areas of AI m ay
progress, but the sweeping requests being m ade by corporations are being m ade without consideration for the people that it affects. The
im pact that AI could have in replacing hum an jobs is also a m ajor concern seeing as how basic m achines have already m ade workers
obsolete in som e areas, and these workers are not fairly assisted or trained for finding new work. Unregulated AI will exacerbate the
problem .
