General Comment
AI m ust be bound to copyright laws like every other individual. Calling copyright laws “unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents” is a slight
to every Am erican creator, director, producer, publisher, et al. While people can certainly m ake works derived from  copyrighted m aterial,
they can’t outright use the copyrighted m aterial. AI, on the other hand, needs to “directly use” copyrighted m aterial(via a library, database,
so on.) An AI should be forced to adhere to the sam e copyright laws as every other individual.
