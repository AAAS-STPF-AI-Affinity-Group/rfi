General Comment
AI is a dangerous tool that the creators/supporters of it do not understand. AI has stolen m oney away from  Am ericans, is incredibly bad
for the environm ent, and is too out of control as it is. AI has no place in Am erican society, and it will in fact, m ake it worse for the lives of
every Am erican.
