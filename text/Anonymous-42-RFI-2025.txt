I'll link some videos which are probably better than reading through long fluffy comments: "Intro 
to AI Safety, Remastered" by Robert Miles - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYXy -A4siMw 
(An accessible explanation of the argument that strongly -superhuman intelligence poses an 
extinction risk) There's also this beautiful channel which animates rationalist essays: "The Power 
of Intelligence" by Eli ezer Yudkowsky - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9Figerh89g "The 
Goddess of Everything Else" by Scott Alexander -
