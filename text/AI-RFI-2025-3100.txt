General Comment
I don't agree that AI holds the future for the United States and other countries, because it's m ostly used for theft of m y and everyone else's
creations, especially copyrighted ones and it's also overhyped and used by rich individuals and corporations for bad purposes, such as
replacing hum an workers with AI ones.
