As a concerned veteran and American, I absolutely oppose this plan top to bottom. AI is the
theft of artwork  and literature produced not only by Americans, but across the world. The
ground you will be walking into has absolutely no use in terms of a product, no military uses,no medical uses, simply nothing of value aside from a plagiarism
 machine.
There is extraordinary and ethical AI out there that needs to be empowered, that is aiding inpredicting weather patterns, aiding in curing disease and helping Doctors work with theirpatients and yes, even military uses for AI. But simply scraping the property of Americanswill not achieve any of these beautiful, practical
 uses and will signal that copyright is only for
the wealthy and elite and that the typical artist has no right to their own work.
