If not already in place, AI and data mining technologies should be used to update technologies in all 
federal government departments and agencies. Technologies that are compatible across the 
executive branch for processing and tracking all budgets, contrac ts, grants, and all fund transfers 
should aim to accomplish efficiency and accountability metrics. Likewise, OPM could implement 
such technologies for performance reviews and mission goals for the federal workforce in 
accordance with specific mission const raints and requirements. Public administrators and 
technologists as well as managers with private sector experience do not always communicate with 
the same kind of understanding and appreciation of how technology can improve performance. 
Bringing together small task forces including all three groups to implement an institutional cultural 
change across the executive branch can serve to create a results -oriented ethos of public sector 
"entrepreneurship." The deeper the institutional memory in any bureaucracy,  the greater the 
resistance to change. The status quo is not sustainable. Transformational change in our public 
institutions will require effective technological change, which might well serve to restore trust in the 
critucal functions of our federal gover nment.
