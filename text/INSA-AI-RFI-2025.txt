AI ACTION PLAN INPUT: ACHIEVING READINESS 
THROUGH A  COMMUNITY -DRIVEN FRAMEWORK  
The Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) is a nonpartisan, nonproﬁt association 
dedicated to advancing collaborative, public -private -academic approaches to intelligence and 
national security priorities. Through the application of industry expertise, leading -edge 
academic research, and commercial best practices, INSA seeks to make the Intelligence and National Security Community more eﬀective and eﬃcient. Our 175+ member organizations and 
4,000+ individual and associate members include senior executives and intelligence experts in 
the public, private, and academic sectors.  
INSA  is pleased to provide the Networking and Information Technology Research and 
Development (NITRD) National Coordination Oﬃce (NCO)  our perspectives and input to the 
nation’s AI Action Plan. As an organization, INSA is in a unique position representing  175+ 
public/private organizations that have ongoing interest and activities with regards to our 
Intelligence Agencies, Labs and Departments providing critical technology in support of the 
country’s national security. Based on collective input and interac tions across the community our 
input focuses on a plan that operationalize s three critical innovation pillars. Building on INSA's 
2024 workforce transformation ﬁndings
1 and 2023 cyber partnership white papers2, this 
roadmap demonstrates how our member ecosystem – spanning  across large national security 
strategists and small, emerging technology ﬁrms  - can accelerate implementation through 
existing collaboration frameworks. 
Our recommendations focus on:  
•Rigor and thoughtfulness in assessment and inventory of capabilities with an emphasis
on interoperability .
•Investment in national -level skills development and enhancement.
•Increased prioritization on public -private partnerships  focused on IP generation and
innovation through a scalable commercialization framework.

1. National Model Inventory & Interoperability Ecosystem
1.1 An Inventory and Assessment Process  
The collective experience over the past several years has demonstrated the gaps in assessing, 
documenting and sharing the inventory of tools, models and integrated capabilities in use or available. A concerted eﬀort must be taken to bring together a wide swath of data, normalizing 
where possible against standardized data collection such as Model Cards, and making these 
data available across key sectors and across public and vetted private industry entities.  
1.2 Federated Model Registry Architecture  
A uniﬁed national registry must adopt a modular architecture  to enable decentralized 
governance while maintaining interoperability. Drawing lessons from the Department of 
Energy’s National Laboratory system, regional nodes could operate under shared standards 
while tailoring implementations to sector -speciﬁc needs —healthcare models at NIH -funded 
facilities, defense systems at DoD testbeds, and civil infrastructure tools at NSF AI Institutes. Each node would enforce standardized metadata requirements, including training data lineage tracked via blockchain (leveraging prototypes from the FDA’s DSCSA pharmaceutical traceability 
system) and ethical risk assessments using frameworks like the NIST AI RMF 1.0. API -ﬁrst design 
principles would mandate OpenAPI standards  compliance . In order to eﬀectively develop an 
ecosystem that is modular yet responsive to unique needs of any one agency or industry, 
international standards and approaches to interoperate model standards need to be developed fundamentally built upon the concept of decentralization.  
Implementation could  prioritize phased adoption: initially at innovation accelerators and  funded 
R&D centers (FFRDCs), followed by incentives tied to federal contracting preferences. Mirroring the CHIPS Act’s success, companies achieving 90% model card completeness and API availability could qualify for accelerated SBIR/STTR grant reviews, while defense contractors might receive priority consideration in RFPs for Joint All- Domain Command and Control (JADC2) programs.   
2. Dynamic Skills Ecosystem Development
2.1 National Skills Topography Mapping  
A skills mapping initiative would combine traditional workforce analytics with emergent competency tracking.  Competency mapping in AI needs to assess math and software 
development skills as well as promoter and coaching skills. Mapping skills is paramount to 
assessing opportunities to reskill and advance our workforce  and should be done utilizing AI in 
conjunction with traditional hard and soft skills analysis. Expert concentration could be 
identiﬁed through machine learning analysis of data such as patent  ﬁlings, academic citations 
and degrees, and industry collaboration patterns. Advocate networks might be mapped using 


natural language processing (NLP)  applied to conference proceedings and policy white papers, 
and identifying key inﬂuencers and research leaders. Competency benchmarks could tier skills 
from foundational (e.g., Python for data analysis) to advanced (e.g., adversarial ML techniques), 
validated against existing and emergent standards . To identify risk -takers, the system could 
analyze startups, grant and SBIR proposals and innovation -oriented projects such as Defense 
Innovation Unit (DIU) project portfolios  and the broader startup landscape  for patterns of 
exploratory R&D, creating a “risk propensity index” to assess entities (individuals and 
companies) modeled after DARPA’s Heilmeier Catechism evaluation framework.  
2.2 Next -Gen Training Infrastructure 
AI MakerSpaces would blend physical and virtual environments, with regional hubs  co-located 
with major academic institutions  taking inspiration from NSA’s Centers for Excellence approach . 
Physical locations might feature quantum computing testbeds ( for example using DOE’s Oak 
Ridge infrastructure) and robotics labs (adapting NASA’s Swarmathon platform3), while virtual 
environments could oﬀer pre -conﬁgured Jupyter notebooks with accessible sample data such as 
US C ensus  Bureau  microdata, NOAA climate datasets  or FDA drug shortage data . Curriculum 
could emphasize creative problem -solving through challenge -based learning —for example, 
having high school  or college  teams optimize wildﬁre prediction models develop supply chain 
resilience algorithms with an emphasis on develop new models or techniques that have not 
been explored yet. Continuous assessment c ould employ adaptive testing engines like the 
Army’s Machine Learning Certainty & Competence Framework4, providing real -time skill gap 
analysis to educators and employers. The goal of such centers should be focus on coalescing, creating and making available a range of training aimed at “leveling -up” our collective ability to 
use, develop, enhance or partner with any class of AI algorithms while understanding and 
managing ris k.  
3. Adaptive Consortium Network
A collaborative approach needs to be designed to foster public -private institutions charted to 
advance the collective growth of IP and trade secret  across AI.  
3.1 Consortium Design Principles  
Public -private consortia must balance agility with accountability. Member -driven collaboration  
leveraging organizations such as INSA  could enable collaboration and collective prioritiz ation of  
R&D objectives . In order to compete against pacing threats, we recommend to AI consortia to 
adhere to three major objectives:  
3 https://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu/   
4 https://github.com/ACI -ICSARL/CandC_Framework 


1.Foster and support increased invention and patents
2.Develop and publish ﬁndings based on AI experimentation and independent testing
3.Manage community -based vetted subject matter experts (SMEs)
To foster experimentation, consortia might establish “sandbox” environments paired with 
synthetic data and sample operational data . Risk assessment would integrate red -teaming 
methodologies from cybersecurity (MITRE ATT&CK framework) with ethical AI evaluation tools, creating standardized playbooks for adversarial testing. Services and resources could be 
provided through these consortia consisting of experts and lawyers to provide tactical assistance with development of materials to support the patent appli cation process. Developing 
the processes, governance and funding mechanisms to support a community and consortia -
driven ecosystem with a fundamental charter to grow the national patent and trade secret basis 
is fundamental to keeping up with and surpassing PRC. Matchmaking across a collection of experts can foster faster reduction to practice and enable rapid use of new technology as quickly as possible.  
3.2 Red Team Exchange Program  
A national red team corps, modeled after the FBI’s Cyber Action Teams5, could conduct biannual 
stress tests of critical AI systems. Defense -focused teams might challenge operational systems 
such as JADC2 decision -support algorithms using tactics observed in Ukraine’s electronic 
warfare operations, while civilian teams could probe hospital predictive staﬃng models against 
synthetic pandemic scenarios. Evaluation s could employ crowdsourced scoring, adapting the 
“Hack the Pentagon” methodology6, with monetary bounties scaled using the Department of 
the Treasury’s software vulnerability severity framework.   
3.3 Licensing and Commercialization Playbook  
Also leveraging the consortia, the Federal Government can develop licensing pathway s that can 
provide a beneﬁcial mechanism for government and commercial interests. Several organizations 
ranging from DARPA to National Labs have commercialization strategies.7 However these 
activities are underutilized and do not provide sustained strategic value. Under the AI Action Plan, a novel AI -focused commercialization framework could be developed and deployed that 
allows for rapid development of capabilities under federal funding and with Government 
Purpose Rights (GPR) allowing for royalty escrow, and providing commercial license grants to 
companies to deploy capabilities in commercial markets. Selected consortia would focus on 
developing the commercialization pathways and incentive mechanisms (to include tax credits)

to meet security and governance needs to protect national security while advancing 
capabilities.
