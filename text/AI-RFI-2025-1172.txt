COMMENTS ON ARTIFICIAL IN TELLIGENCE ACTIO N PLAN 
Marc h 13, 2025 
The Global Data  Alliance (GDA)1 appreciates the opportunity to submit the comments to the Office of Science and 
Technology  Policy  (OSTP)  and the National  Science  Foundation (NSF) in connection  with the Administration’s 
Artificial Intelligence ( AI) Action Plan.2 We welcome the leadership of OSTP and NSF  in advancing this Plan.  
The GDA is a cross -industry coalition of companies headquartered and/or having extensive operations across the 
United States . GDA member companies support tens of millions of well- paying US jobs  in all sectors. GDA member 
companies  are active  in the aerospace, agriculture,  automotive,  energ y, finance,  health,  hospita lity, insurance, 
manufacturing,  natural  resources,  publishing,  software,  supply  chain,  telecommunications,  and transportation 
sectors.  GDA members rely on the ability to access and transfer data across borders to innovate and create jobs.  
The GDA  urges  the US government  to promot e cross- border  data access  to fulfill AI Action  Plan goals . Cross-
border  access  to, and transfers  of, data are critical  to sustaining  and enhancing America's AI -driven  economic 
competitiveness  and national  securit y. We recommend  a whole -of-government  approach that promotes  the free 
and responsible  flow of data,  and – where  appropriate  – interoperable  data transfer  mechanisms.  Such  an 
approach can leverage existing US government efforts and tools to promote cross -border data transfers , including 
at the Office of the US Trade Representative and the Department s of Commerce , State, and Treasur y.  
DISCUSSION 
Consistent  with the January  2025 Executive  Order  on Removing  Barriers  to American  Leadership  in Artificial 
Intelligence , cross-border  access  to, and transfers  of, data are critical  to meeting  the AI Action  Plan goals  of 
promoting progress in the sciences, technology,  and in the development of new products, services, and economic 
opportunities . US job creators are increasingly developing and deploying AI tools across their operations, as are 
US s cience- and innovation- oriented organizations. The success of these efforts to develop and deploy  AI at scale  
depends, first and foremost, on the application of computational data analytics techniques to data sourced globall y. 
From developing predictive models to deploying and using analytical solutions, data analytics systems are “trained” 
by ingesting  large  global  data sets to identify  underlying  patterns,  relationships,  and trends  that are then 
transformed  into mathematical  models  that can make  predictions  based  on new data inputs.  As outlined  in the 
Annex,  these  data sets often  originate  from geographically  dispersed  sources  across  transnational  digital networks, 
making it imperative that data can move seamlessly and securely  across borders. To secure the insights and other 
benefits that data analytics can provide, it is important to work with partner governments to avoid impediments to 
data access on improper grounds (i.e., on grounds that are arbitrar y, discriminator y, disguised, or unnecessary) . 
Smart and responsible deployment of AI tools , supported by data inputs from across the globe, can help advance 
improvements  in healthcare,  modernize  education,  increase  business  productivity  and competitiveness,  and 
strengthen cybersecurity and national securit y.  
To promote AI -driven advances in science, technolog y, and the econom y, the United  States should engage with 
allied economies  to ensure  that US cross -border  access  to data is not improperly  impeded  through  foreign 
government  data transfer  barriers  that are arbitrar y, discriminator y, disguised,  or unnecessar y. Please  do not 
hesitate to reach out with any questions or comments.  
Sincerely  yours, 
Executiv e Director 
Global Data Alliance 


ANNEX  
Illustrative List of AI Applications that Depend Upon Cross -Border Access to Data  
We offer below a few (widely recognized) examples of insights, predictions, and other outputs derived from 
computational analysis in the machine learning context  of data derived from transnational sources :  
•Automated flight management  and air tr affic control based on computational analysis of meteorological
conditions, real -time fuel consumption, aircraft operational data, nearby air traffic conditions, airport
congestion, and numerous other data elements  across international airspace and global aviation assets .3
•Identification of chemical and cellular anomalies across global population groups for early di agnosis,
prevention, and treatment  in the fields of oncology, autoimmune disorders, and Parkinsons and Alzheimer ’s
disease.4 
•By integrati ng generative AI into security operations  that draw on g lobal inputs,  organizations can better
identify and address security anomalies, as well as detect and mitigate potential threats.
•Predictive climate modeling based on computati onal analysis of satellite data, weather station data,
topographical information, and various IoT and sensor data  from around the world .5
•Improved carbon tracking and mitigation  based on comput ational analysis of transportation logs, meter
readings, fuel purchase records, atmospheric pollution tracking, and visual monitoring of power plants and
other facilities, and other data sources  from different countries and regions .6
•Computational ana lysis to map vulnerable seaside areas to produce cyclone risk maps and guide investment
plans for c yclone shelters, schools, health facilities, and other infrastructure for disaster planning and
survivability .7
•Predictive typing and other office productivity solutions  (e.g., an “aut o-complete” function that suggests the
letters “…cerely yours” after the typist inputs the letters, “sin”),8 or the creation of sound effects or special
effects to assist creators and film producers  in developing new artworks.9
