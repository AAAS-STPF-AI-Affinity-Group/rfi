General Comment
AI has m any powerful applications, but risks even bigger abuses. Generative AI m ust be lim ited by law to protect artists, authors,
film m akers, voice actors and narrators, and all other creatives from  having their work stolen and used to train m odels and generate profit
for billionaires. We m ust prioritize people over profits and ensure that creators retain the rights to their own work, with no exceptions for
AI m odels.
