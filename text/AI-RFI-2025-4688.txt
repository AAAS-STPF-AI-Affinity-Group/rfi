General Comment
Billions of dollars are being spent on artificial intelligence in the private sector and all we have to show for it is Chat GPT errors,
skyrocketing energy usage, creepy deepfake videos, and the threatening of thousands of jobs for artists, writers, and other creators. The
federal governm ent should be regulating AI, not enabling it. Protect intellectual property, force tech com panies to tell us when AI is used,
and allow users to opt out.
