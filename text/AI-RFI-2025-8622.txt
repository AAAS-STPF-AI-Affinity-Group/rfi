General Comment
I think the United States is operating recklessly in regards to AI use. If AI steals from  the governm ent, will there be anything done to
restrict it? And before that, will there be anything done to stop scrapping of ostensibly private data such as m edical records, identifying
inform ation, etc.? Already there is nothing stopping private com panies from  collecting identifying data on their custom ers, and worse,
nothing to stop them  selling that data. If this plan goes forward, privacy in the United States will be long dead. It's an insult to the
Am erican public to put the interests of a few private com panies before the personal security of individual citizens. 
Do Not go through with this plan - protect the rem aining privacy of Am erican citizens.
