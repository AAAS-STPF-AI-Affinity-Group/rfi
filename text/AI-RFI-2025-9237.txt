General Comment
I am  an Illustrator and Com ics artist.
Generative AI technologies like chatGPT, Dall-E, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney are based on the stolen work of m yself and m illions of
other creators. OpenAI has adm itted that their technologies would not be operable without access to our work, and has shown no
intentions of com pensating the creative com m unity.
Additionally, generative AI technologies that generate new im agery can be m anipulated to create fake im agery that results in dangerous
political disinform ation, or else poses a threat to the privacy and security of Am ericans. The databases these technologies are based on -
LAION-5B in particular - contain problem atic im ages and text pairs of sexual assault, child sexual abuse, and extrem e cases of violence.
These datasets need to be better regulated, and there either needs to be consent or com pensation involved in gathering the work of
creatives to train these technologies. We also need to be m ore m indful about what AI research organizations have access to in order to
protect victim s of violence and sexual assault. There is too m uch potential for these technologies to ruin people's lives through creation of
false im agery - if com panies like OpenAI truly care about the betterm ent of hum anity, then they need to consider the possible ways their
technologies can be used for harm , especially against m arginalized com m unities, and build regulations that prevent or m itigate harm .
Thank you for your attention.
