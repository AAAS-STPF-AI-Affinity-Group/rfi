General Comment
Algorithm ic Intelligence should have no future in United States lawm aking, or any future of any kind. It has no purpose other than stealing
the rightful livelihood of hum an beings and to m ash what it has consum ed into a hom ogeneous paste. It has no m ore econom ic value than
Non-Fungible Tokens, and anything action plan that does not center around restricting it is not acceptable.
