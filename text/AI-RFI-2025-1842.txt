General Comment
I am  writing to ask you to not pass the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. Allowing m ajor tech com panies like
Google and OpenAI to freely use people's content on the internet, especially from  creatives like artists and actors, to train their AI
software without their consent is a privacy violation. Additionally, content that is solely AI-generated cannot be protected by copyright
and thus unable to be profited off of. Lastly, there is also a lack of proper regulations for AI use, which has been used to force hum ans
into losing their jobs and contribute to the spread of online m isinform ation. Not passing the act will protect creatives' work and our
inform ation, both personal and otherwise, from  being exploited and m isused. Thank you.
