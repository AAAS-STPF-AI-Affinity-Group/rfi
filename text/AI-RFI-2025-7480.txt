General Comment
The process by which m achine learning program s like this, and com panies like OpenAI specifically, use is nothing short of theft from  the
Am erican people. To allow som ething of that m agnitude to be exem pt from  any form  of repercussions is allowing theft directly from  any
and all Am ericans.
