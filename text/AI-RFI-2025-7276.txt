General Comment
At no point should any AI com pany be m ade im m une to lawsuits over copyright. If they train their m odels on copyrighted m aterial, those
owners should be com pensated. If they do so without the perm ission of the copyright owner, those dam ages should be punitive and
exponential. And if they regurgitate out copyrighted m aterial, those sam e owners should be com pensated. There's no derivative work
involved. This is the wholesale theft of creative works by those without an ounce of creativity in them .
