General Comment
I see no reason that a particular technology (and particularly one of lim ited utility to the world) should have special treatm ent with regard
to copyright. Such a policy would be extrem ely regressive, concentrating wealth in the hands of the technological elite at the expense of
countless creators laboring to m ake all our lives richer. If you starve artists of the ability to support them selves m aking art, you will find
existence a m uch drearier place.
