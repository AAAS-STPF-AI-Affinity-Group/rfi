General Comment
I have seen too m any artists, too m any perform ers, too m any creative individuals lose everything they worked for because of the use of ai.
AI has done nothing but steal the hard work and efforts of REAL LIVE CREATIVE people, and shilled nothing but garbage, and
falshoods!
I do not want to see the content or m edia I love be turned into lazy, ugly, heartless trash!
The im ages or recordings people have used ai to generate can have a very real effect on people and their careers, and it should be taken
m ore seriously! Not as som e way to save a buck on a project (surprise, it'll actually cost m ore in the long run!)
Stop ai! Protect real people!
