Copyright is in place to protect the artist, writer, m usician. AI steals from  these creators, replicating souless variants that lower the
reputation of the original creator and in stealing these works, AI also robs the person of com pensation. To say nothing of the resources
wasted to m ake one piece of AI garbage.
Use AI to help eradicate diseases instead.
