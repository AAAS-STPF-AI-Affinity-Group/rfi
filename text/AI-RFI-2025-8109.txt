General Comment
It is m y firm  belief that AI doesnâ€™t not hold a place in the econom ic, technological, political future of the United States. AI trained on
private data is built on theft and steals from  the livelihood's of m ine and m any other Am ericans. It is being funded on a speculative bubble
and has produced no real value. The tim e and energy spent on assisting the private AI industry would be better directed towards another
avenue to ensure Am erican success and prosperity.
