AI ho lds no value and if it were to create value it creates it by stealing from actual artists and 
peopl e and passes it off as something new there have even be cases where it steals from itself. 
Not to mention the various legal mishaps and criminal activity that can be caused by it such as 
forging evidence to get someone wrongfully convicted or having a suspect portrait be completely wrong leading to the wrong arrest. I feel we need to properly investigate and regulate AI before any "action plan" is created  so that we know what taxpayer money is being spent on and funded 
rather than the money being just haphazardly thrown into a pit and hoping more money comes out.
