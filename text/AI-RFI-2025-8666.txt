General Comment
AI does not have a future woth out governm ent. Our governm ent is for the people and is sustained by the people. The fact we want to
replace so m any of these people with an AI is highly concerning. AI is not Artificial Intelligence, it does not think like flesh and blood. It
does not m ake new ideas, it does not know how to be creative or m ake new ideas. AI only copies what it sees, and doesn't know how to
build from  it. This is an action only done to m ake COMPANIES that use AI IMMUNE from  laws m eant to protect the people. It should
not be m ade legal to take from  hardworking and honest people, it is what copyright is m ade for in the first place.
COPYRIGHT IS HERE FOR A REASON, THE FACT COMAPNIES WANT TO CIRCUMVENT IT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE,
OR FORM, IS AN ATTACK ON CREATIVE WORKS BY HONEST PEOPLE!
