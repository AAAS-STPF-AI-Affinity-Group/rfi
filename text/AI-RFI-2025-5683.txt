General Comment
I do not believe that generative AI holds a place for the future of any country let alone Am erica. A “service” that provides no actual utility
to Am ericans, steals from  Am erican creators, and m ust have “guardrails” rem oved to be effective is not a service we should utilize or be
proud of. Generative AI should require proof that it has not scraped from  copyrighted or tradem arked m aterial which it has never yet
been capable of proving. This m ove is ill sighted. I oppose it as an Am erican.
