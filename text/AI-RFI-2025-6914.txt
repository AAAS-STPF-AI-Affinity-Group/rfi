General Comment
I am  a published and working writer and have alm ost 30 years of m y work published on the internet through various sites I sold m y work
to. I do not want m y work to be scaled, scrubbed, studied or whatever euphem ism  AI developers use to m itigate the actual dam age their
products do and the actual pay they take from  writers and other creatives. Stop this, AI is a throttle on actual hum an creativity and it is a
threat to the livelihoods of creatives and artists across all m edium s and genres.
