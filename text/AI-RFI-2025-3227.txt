General Comment
AI is NOT what Am erica needs. AI is not the future of our country. AI takes away the life and love of everything m ost Am ericans stand
for. Allowing AI com plete im m unity allows hardworking artists to lose their careers and drains the life out of any work put out by it. As a
hardworking illustration m ajor hoping to m ake a living as an artist, I am  begging you to reconsider. Please do not give AI ultim ate power.
