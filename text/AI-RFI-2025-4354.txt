General Comment
Hi!
I work in film  and television and already know, from  the tools that are out there, that things I have worked on have had their copyright
infringed upon by OpenAI and other GenAI com panies. This DIRECTLY negatively affects m y ability to earn a living and to provide for
m y fam ily. I recognize that AI developm ent will continue. But com panies like OpenAI MUST be held accountable for their business
practices, including knowingly infringing on other peopleâ€™s work to generate wealth for them selves. Allowing them  to do what they want
will cripple m ultiple generations of artists and creators. The long term  benefits of m aking Sam  Altm an richer do not com e close to
outweighing the costs to the econom y im that will happen when Am erican culture, art and entertainm ent (which are key to the way the
nation is seen across the world) is cheapened and destroyed.
