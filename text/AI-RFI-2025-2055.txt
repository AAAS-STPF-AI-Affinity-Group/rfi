General Comment
I know I m ay never m ake a living off m y art. But to know that sharing online is only a path to m aking AI better and better at taking that
living away from  others is enough to stifle m y m otivation from  m aking any at all. 
I also teach m ath and art. Every day I dread a student asking m e what the point of being in art classes at all is when they could just prom pt
AI. And every day I'm  less and less confident of m y answers. If som ething isn't done to address generative AI, the sim ple drive to pick up
a pencil and doodle is going to be replaced with dribbling words into a prom pter until it spits out som ething close enough. Traditional art,
and using m arkers, color pencils, paint, they all com e from  the urge to doodle first, and evolve from  there. Even if AI will never m ake
physical paintings and original pieces, those will go away too if young artists do not want to doodle.
I attached a piece I did shortly before college. Only because it would not exist if I could just type "rainbow crystal dragon" and get a
crystal dragon in a com pletely different style with a rainbow in the background and been happy with it. It was a doodle I couldn't step
away from . It only exists because I was learning to m ake things pretty. And AI would've m ade 'pretty' far too easy.
