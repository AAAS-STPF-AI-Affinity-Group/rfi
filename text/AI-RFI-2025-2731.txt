General Comment
This is harm ful to every single creator out there, be it artists, gam e developers, video creators, stream ers... every single creative industry
will suffer from  this and they m ay not be able to continue what they are doing. AI itself is harm ful to both the environm ent and to hum an
artists and creators. The content AI creates has no real value, so it takes the creativity out of art. I don't want to see a future where AI is
everywhere because it just destroys the lives of real artists.
