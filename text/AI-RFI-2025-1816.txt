General Comment
I'm  an artist: have been since I was a child, and will be until whatever far-off day I die. Ever since the introduction of AI program s,
prim arily such program s as generative AI, m ost folks I know and have studied with -folks I know to be som e of the m ost earnest and
hardworking folks on the planet- have been out of work since. I have been unable to find work ever since I graduated due to com panies
opting to replace m y work with AI. If you dem olish things like privacy and copyright at the behest of big com panies in the nam e of beating
out som e other country in a useless race to the bottom  of the barrel, you'll be putting m illions of Am ericans out of work and collapsing an
entire part of the already fragile econom y and, god forbid, whatever confidence rem ains in living in this country. Do you really want the
death of the Am erican arts to be on your hands? Can you fathom  being covered in all that blood and having death breathe cold down your
spine? For once, do the right thing and do the sm art thing: don't bother with investing in AI.
