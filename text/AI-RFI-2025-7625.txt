General Comment
My nam e is Susquehanna Haser. I am  from  Pennsylvania. I have struggled to find a norm al job and art is one of the only things I am
confident with. AI im ages steal from  sm all artists, including writers, and is putting them  out of jobs. It's also m aking im ages easier to fake
as it is constantly being trained to be better. This can and already has lead to illegal activity. These things should at least be copyrighted.
