General Comment
AI produced content is nothing but garbage. This is a product that no one outside of the tech industry actually wants, but is constantly
being forced upon us. AI produced work m ust be beholden to copyright law the sam e as any other work, and the copyrights of the
creators who Open AI openly steal from  m ust have their rights protected. That isnâ€™t just m y own opinion, that has been how Am erican
copyright law has functioned for several decades.
