As a society, we should encourage new and emerging technological advancements and innovations 
like artificial intelligence (AI) because of the inherent benefits associated with their development. 
This is partly because the innovative efforts behind the cre ation of these new and progressive 
technologies contribute significantly to the measurable progress of humanity. Nevertheless, new 
technology, if left unfettered, without guidelines and oversights, can result in immeasurable harm 
to society, particularly m arginalized, vulnerable, and disenfranchised groups. Organizations such 
as the Department of Defense (DoD), with both influence and resources, that have employed the 
use of AI should do so by adopting ethical standards that are rooted in moral values, the rule of law, 
and industry best practices. As AI technology continues to develop, the DoD will likely maintain and 
sustain its position as a global leader and international partner by advancing this ethical AI strategy.
