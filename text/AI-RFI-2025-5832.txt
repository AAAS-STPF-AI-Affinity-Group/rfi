General Comment
I don’t want m y tax dollars subsidizing an overvalued industry intent on stealing others’ hard work for profit. I also believe digital laws,
especially regarding fair use, need to be updated with the advent of AI, since it would disincentivize m aking original works in favor of
creating endless derivatives and put people’s livelihoods in jeopardy. It is an especially uneven dynam ic when an AI com pany is given
m assive governm ent support in order to do so, too.
