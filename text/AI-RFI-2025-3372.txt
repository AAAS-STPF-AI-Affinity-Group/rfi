General Comment
I do not believe that AI should be allowed to steal from  the Am erican people. Whether it be art, writing, or anything else that we as
Am ericans create with our own thoughts and ideas. AI should not be above the law. It should not be allowed to steal. It should not have a
place in the future of Am erica. If AI is allowed to steal from  the Am erican people, it will destroy the lives of m any Am ericans. If AI is
allowed to steal from  the Am ericam  people, you are telling the Am erican people that they do not m atter and that you don't care if they are
hurt by it. Do not allow AI to bypass the law and copyright. AI is overhyped and should have no business in the lives of the Am erican
people.
