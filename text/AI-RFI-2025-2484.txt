General Comment
I believe AI to be som ething of a public wrong that steals from  individuals for the profit of big corporations that feeds us m isinform ation
and poorer products. taking jobs from  the individual for the sake of a worse Am erica where less jobs and worse consum er goods is not
what we should be prioritizing, this would benefit a select few while harm ing m asses as a whole. we are already encouraged to think less
by big AI com panies that attem pt to feed us thoughts from  a m achine that does not think for itself, we will be less educated, less creative,
and less protected by AI and its controllers.
