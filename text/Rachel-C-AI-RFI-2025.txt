Hello,
Good evening. I was recently informed of the new AI Action Plan going into effect. I wanted to provide my input as
a member of the artist and content creation community.
Allowing AI to use any copyrighted material destroys the future of original work. The use of AI takes profits away
from American artists and, on a global scale, creates a future where America is no longer a lead innovator. There isno future for original work if AI can easily steal the right to said work.
Please consider what this means for Americans such as myself and others who survive on profits from our original
creations, be it art, music, or otherwise.
Allowing AI to use our copyrighted work will be catastrophic to millions of Americans. AI is built on theft, and if
this bill goes through, so will our country.
Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will consider the input already sent by many others who worry
for the future of our country should AI be given free rein over our creations.
