General Comment
Generative AI has proven itself tim e and tim e again as a technology that is fundam entally unprofitable, and every prom ise that bigger LLM
data sets will lead to better m odels has yet to live up to expectation. Meanwhile, the proliferation of Generative AI has stolen from  the
livelihoods of countless Am ericans, particularly in creative industries, often with the explicit intent of underm ining their roles in the
econom y. Am erica is a titan of culture creation, and the capital which that influence creates is a cornerstone to both our econom y and our
society. To allow Generative AI this level of access to copyrighted m aterial is to subvert and dim inish entire industries with no
consideration for the econom ic or cultural fallout of such an action. Allowing this access will steal jobs, unravel crucial industries, and
wreck the Am erican econom y for the sake of a technology that has yet to prove itself as useful or revolutionary as it claim s to be. To
allow this kind of access betrays Am ericans, which m eans it is wholly anti-Am erican, and therefore has no place in the future of Am erica.
