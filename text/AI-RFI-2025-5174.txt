General Comment
To whom  it m ay concern,
There is no benefit whatsoever to sacrifice the works, livelihoods, and efforts of all of our artists of innum erable stripes across the United
States in the hope of m aking a “use case” for AI. By cutting out the legs of our nation-worth of artists, m illions strong, by subjecting all of
their works to corporate use and greed is a sickening prospect. Destroying livelihoods just for yet another rug-pull of the tech industry,
solely m eant to enrich the few under the guise of “m aking our country stronger and m ore com petitive” is a perversion of our values as a
nation and only em boldens not only our descent into placating the thieves and the crooks, but our decline on the world stage within the
arts. Support those who actually CREATE, not a renam ed LLM whose sole business m odel relies on lies and destroying hundreds of
thousands of jobs.
