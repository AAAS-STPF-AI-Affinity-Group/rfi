General Comment
My nam e is Myla Azen, and I am  a graduating senior from  Avonworth High School. I researched the im pact of generative AI on religious
persecution for a sem ester course and recently studied this adm inistration's viewpoint on AI regulation. Based on two m onths of student
research, I think regulation and preventative laws are essential to ensure that artificial intelligence flourishes beneficially. With AI quickly
advancing globally, religious groups across the nation are increasingly vulnerable to the potential m isuse of AI. Specifically, the Uyghur
Muslim  population in China has been targeted under "anti-terrorism " sentim ents. AI-powered surveillance and policing tactics have been
utilized to suppress religious groups and violate hum an rights. Preventative m easures m ust be put in place to reduce the risks of AI being
weaponized against vulnerable populations. I believe such regulations can protect not only religious freedom s but also the fundam ental
rights of all individuals.
