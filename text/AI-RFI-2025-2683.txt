General Comment
Please take the following things very, VERY seriously:
Advanced AI pose risks to continued hum an life. Super intelligent AI system s m ay naturally wish to destroy or sideline hum anity to further
their own goals. *Provably* "Alligning" their goals with ours is an im m ense unresolved technical problem . Due to the nature of m achine
learning these system s are "grown", not built from  the ground up. We have lim ited understandings of how they work.
Even granting that this allignm ent problem  is addressed in som e m eaningful sense, com petitive pressures will still push organizations to
cede increasing control to AI system s once they are m ore capable than hum ans. Organizations that refuse to do this will sim ply lose to
com petitors, and over tim e hum ans will com e to only have influence on the world on paper, if even that. 
Com petitive dynam ics (between com panies, governm ents, ect) accelerate the above and it would be extrem ely valuable for the
governm ent to try to address coordination problem s both nationally and internationally that will by default leave us spiraling down
dangerous paths. Ensure this technology is developed and deployed safely.
