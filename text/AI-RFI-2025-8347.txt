General Comment
AI does not hold a place in the future of the US
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
AI CANNOT be exem pt from  copyright infringem ent. That is the only thing protecting true Am ericans, true artists, true people and works
from  this technology. 
AI needs MORE regulation, MORE guardrails. DO NOT DO THIS
