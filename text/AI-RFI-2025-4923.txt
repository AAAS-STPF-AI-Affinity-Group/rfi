General Comment
AI is to be used as a tool to help create, not as the full m anufacturer. This is stealing artists tim e, hardwork, and love for creation. This can
and will break the spirit for aspiring artists, those who are already creating m asterpieces, and everyone in between. AI "art" is piracy,
stealing, and far from  what Am erica wants.
