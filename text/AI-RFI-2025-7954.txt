General Comment
Under no circum stances is AI entitled to the fruits of work done by creative artists protected by copyright, even if that copyright is im plied
and not registered. 
If that im poses risks and/or higher costs on AI, then the owners/operators of that AI can assess those risks and choose to accept them  or
decline. They do not get a free pass to steal from  and then incorporate the work of othersâ€™ creativity for no fee or paym ent, and at no risk.
Basic fairness to those who have created works m ust be honored.
AI is not som ehow m agical or special, deserving of rem oving rights from  artists.
