General Comment
Generative AI is, frankly, a net resource drain for net negative value. It serves no practical purpose except to enrich the already wealthy
by stealing the labour of the people who actually have the ideas and skills to create art and cultural works.
Letting that theft continue unchecked, and providing it with legal protection, is a concession that says that Am ericans cannot create works
of value. It is a statem ent to the world that we are, culturally, bankrupt- only capable of producing through the m indless and distorted
replications of that which already exists. It is a declaration to the Am erican people that their ideas and aspirations are of no value.
