General Comment
As a songwriter and m usician I am  writing to express m y opposition to letting generative AI train on the creative output of hum an artists
and m usicians. This represents a threat to m usicians, songwriters, authors, and visual artists. Additionally, our work should be protected
via copyright and these com panies should not be allowed to use it to train their program s without consent and com pensation.
