General Comment
This is a gross infringem ent upon our intellectual property and sets a dangerous precedent for so m any things.
There are already plenty of docum ents AI could use for this purpose. 
We are already seeing AI bots posing as real people all over social m edia, pretending to be sm all business owners, publishing dangerously
erroneous books on herbalism  and the like. AI needs to he reigned in, not given free reign to plagiarize the hard work and expertise of
people trying their best to m ake a living in this digital age.
