General Comment
AI is built on the theft of the work and ideas of the Am erican people, and that shouldn't be allowed to pass without consequence. It isn't
even being used in service of a greater good, it is a con put forward by tech com panies that are running out of good ideas, so they are
stealing from  others. Don't let them  get away with it.
