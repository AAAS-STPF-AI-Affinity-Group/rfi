General Comment
LLM-based, so called "AI" is a dead end technology that is environm entally disastrous, fundam entally unfit for purpose, and should be
regulated out of existence. It cannot provide accurate inform ation, accelerated spam  and scam s, and is entirely unaccountable. 
All the while, it depends on the wholesale theft of IP from  everyone from  ordinary people, to the largest publishers in history. This theft
creates a chilling effect on authorship for anyone without access to a team  of IP lawyers to defend their rights, as the creators of this
technology use the existence of a work as sufficient justification to steal and replace it. 
The US governm ent should be at m inim um  discouraging, and frankly, banning this technology. Not encouraging it
