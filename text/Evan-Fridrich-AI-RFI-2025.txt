I was born and raised in this country and never in a million years did I expect that we would be so 
rotten to the core as we are today. AI is, for lack of a better term, downright satanic in its 
insidiousness and will poison the minds and hearts of the American People. I, as an American 
Citizen, will exercise my right to say that I want my country to abandon AI, and foster industries and 
technologies that celebrate HUMAN ingenuity and HUMAN spirit . Humanity first over all other 
things.
