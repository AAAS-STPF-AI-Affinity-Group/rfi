General Comment
AI is not hum an. It is a sim ple m achine and belongs to m any, it is not a hardworking citizen like us. It has no place in the future of the US
developm ent, and should not be allowed to bypass the rules and regulations set on us, and carve out our years of hard work nearly
instantaneously. AI should not be allowed to use our work, without copyright, without punishm ent. It is ultim ately undoing the effort we
have put into our works and therefore should not be allowed.
