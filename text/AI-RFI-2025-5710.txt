General Comment
Understand that LLMs and Generative AI, as used by com panies like OpenAI, represent a fundam ental threat to the protections provided
to creators under current US copyright laws. AI of this nature m ust be trained on copyrighted work to be effective, and training on
copyrighted work m eans that any output is ipso-facto derivative and owes creation to said copyrighted work. As such, I urge the
governm ent to place regulations on AI to prevent them  from  training on copyrighted work without due com pensation to the creators of
such works.
