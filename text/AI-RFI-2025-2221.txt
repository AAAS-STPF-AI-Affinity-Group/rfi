General Comment
I do not believe Ai has a benefit to the Am erican people as a whole in regards to m any applications. Though I understand it can help with
efficiency. It can not out right replace the m ajority of Am erican jobs that require creativity and com m on sense. Which i thought that is what
Trum p ran on.
I realize the Am erican dream  is to be successful. But how are is too far? I am  pro business, pro capitalism . But I am  anti crony corporate
and anti investor. 
I can see Ai's use needed in defense and strategy. Lim ited use in education. But corporations desire to further reduce their work force so
they can further deepen their pockets is absolutely a no go. Ai should not be allowed for any form  of corporate greed. Which is what is
being heavily pushed. Ai generated ads and Ai generated focused consum erism  needs to stop. 
Ai should not be used to target people to spend m oney. Should not be used to further ones education, that alone feels like cheating and no
educational retention com es from  it.
long story short. No Ai if it m eans greed, reduced creativity, and reduced education. End of story.
