General Comment
Do NOT let AI com panies the right to steal our work, history and art we’ve worked hard to m ake for generations. These inhum ane
thieves know nothing of struggle, creativity, passion and hum anity that we all go through every day to achieve the im possible and it’s what
m akes hum an life so precious to live on for decades. If you let them  lose, we will all fall and our lives will be rendered m eaningless.
