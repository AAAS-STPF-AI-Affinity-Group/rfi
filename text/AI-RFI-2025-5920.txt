General Comment
No one should be allowed to steal, no m atter how profitable it would be for them . No one should be allowed to steal, no m atter how less
burdensom e their business would be if they could. I can't believe we're seriously considering "But it would be easier for m e if I could steal"
to be a valid argum ent. Copyrighted works are protected from  unauthorized use by law. They m ust rem ain so. I oppose this action plan
and any other action plan which carves out AI com panies as having lim itless perm ission to use the copyrighted work of others without
com pensating them .
