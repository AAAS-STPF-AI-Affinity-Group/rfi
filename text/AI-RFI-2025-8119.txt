General Comment
"...the United States can solidify its position as the leader in AI and secure a brighter future for all Am ericans."
What "all Am ericans" is this referring to? Is this really a brighter future for the Am ericans who are having their work stolen by AI without
any com pensation? A brighter future to all the Am ericans that are losing their positions in com panies to AI? A brighter future for all the
Am ericans that are now shoveled AI features that can not be turned off, or are opted-in from  the start, barely m entioned and the way to
disable them  tucked away in the back corners of settings? How bright of a future is one where Am ericans don't know how to research
anything on their own because AI is always holding their hand?
Will it really be a brighter future if AI com panies can train their m achines with less restrictions- or rather, steal m ore of whatever they what
to fill their database? 
This will be m ore secure? 
Why does it m atter so m uch for Am erica to be the leader in AI if it's tearing apart our job m arket, ham pering on the growth of critical
thinking and self-reliance, m aking our artists and other creatives suffer, and will be overtly obtrusive in our day to day lives- taking what it
wants without our proper consent?
So, let m e ask again- who are the Am ericans that will be securing a brighter future from  this? I think we all know that it will not be "all," far
from  it.
