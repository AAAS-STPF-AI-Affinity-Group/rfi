General Comment
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. I have art and writing posted online and the fact corporations can
profit off m y work without m e receiving com pensation is abhorrent. We m ust protect sm all businesses and creatives.
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
