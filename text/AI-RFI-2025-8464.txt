General Comment
AI is ultim ately an energy ineffective m ethod that is being abused to produce cheap, m eaningless content by countless bad actors,
dam aging the trust m any have on artists across the internet and beyond out of fear that what they see isn't truly art but a cheap im itation
rendered by a m achine.
No m atter how pure the intentions, there should be brakes and lim itations to the content these com panies and their projects can intake,
and it should respect the boundaries of other nations and individuals.
This won't m ake the situation any easier, m erely exarcebate the issue.
