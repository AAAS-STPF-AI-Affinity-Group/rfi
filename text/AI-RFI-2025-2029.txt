General Comment
As a staff artist for Snoopy, I intim ately know the jobs that protecting IP can create. By allowing tech wholesale access to IP for AI
technologies, it will be gutting one industry to benefit another. Furtherm ore, this issue can m ostly be solved by tech com panies properly
licensing the IPs they would like to use. Protect the jobs of Am erican creatives and ensure tech com panies m ust properly license the IP
that they use.
