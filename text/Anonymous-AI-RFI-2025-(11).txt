Anonymous, 
If my choice is between a lawless free-for- all where private companies are empowered to 
consume, copy, and sell the works of the few creators that can afford to live off of their art OR 
"unnecessarily burdensome requirements" imposed by the government, I'd honestly prefer the latter. I work in tech; I've seen my less -tenured peers get chased out of industry due to the 
promise of low -quality-but- cheap, AI -written code. I've taught coding and had to tell my students 
that looking for jobs is going to be hard because of the overuse of AI. My friends are musicians and artists who are having their work stolen every day. So: while I understand that the tech industry is moving toward AI and not away, I'm loath to support letting such companies build their LLMs unfet tered. I would like to see more restrictions, not fewer; stronger copyright 
enforcement, not weaker; a government that wants to protect the creator, not the AI startup.
