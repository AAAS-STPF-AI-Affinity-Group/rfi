General Comment
AI has no place in the future of Am erica. It only functions on the stolen work of our citizens and endangers our jobs in a tim e where the
job m arket is already unstable. It uses energy and resources that could go to better this country. On top of that, with the digital age
m isinform ation with AI is already ram pant on social m edia. If this technology becom es better, it will becom e easier for Chinese and
Russian propaganda to infiltrate Am erican society. It has already been used to defam e m y neighbors and countrym en with deepfakes.
There is little profit or good use to be had with generative AI except for m aking the next generations lazier and lazier. AI is a profitless
hole that I pray the governm ent doesnâ€™t continue dum ping our hard earned tax dollars into.
