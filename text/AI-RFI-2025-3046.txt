General Comment
As an artist, it's already hard enough to m ake it by and be successful in the current econom ic clim ate.
Allowing AI to go unchecked will result in job losses, angry consum ers, and catastrophic consequences in the arts industries, including
m assive losses of profit.
Furtherm ore, it will force m ore people whose life's work is art to work jobs we have been told are beneath us, jobs we were told to avoid
if we were worth anything. Now we are being threatened with working the jobs we were told were only for the unskilled.
