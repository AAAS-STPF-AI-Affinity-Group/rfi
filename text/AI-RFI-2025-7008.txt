General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT has not im proved its abilities to sum m arize things in the
past 2 years. AI is bad for the econom y. It is destroying the long beloved hum an tradition of art itself. If this proposal is allowed to be
im plem ented, com panies are going to lose so m uch m oney from  the resulting boycotts, which m eans their shareholders and executives will
be hurt. Supporting AI does not truly support business interests or the free m arket econom y.
