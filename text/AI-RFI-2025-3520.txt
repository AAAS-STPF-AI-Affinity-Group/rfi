General Comment
I do not believe that this will help the U.S. in any m eaningful way, and will instead be to it's detrim ent. This will set a dangerous president
that allows com panies to com pletely bypass any form  of copyright and legal protection for the sake of their own benefit and will hurt
m illions of creatives in our nation and worldwide. AI is not the future for our country and will only drag us deeper into econom ic and
societal decline.
