General Comment
AI is theft, taking som eone's hard work -- whether it be art, m usic, film , or even their voice and face -- has and always will be considered
theft.
Art upholds the world. Do not let it becom e a soulless slog which big tech will m ass produce from  those who do not consent to their art
being used.
Do not let creativity be defiled.
