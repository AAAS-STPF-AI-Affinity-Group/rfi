General Comment
As an Am erican constituent, I am  opposed to the proliferation of AI in this m anner. Generative AI steals from  hardworking artists. It
sources its 'training' m aterial from  others' work towards the end goal of replicating, im proving upon, and replacing that work without
hum an input. It has been used already to replace the paid labor of artists. It will harm  our econom y, its unregulated copyright violations
threaten to destroy the sacred institution of art, and it consum es a m assive am ount of power that working Am ericans cannot afford to lose.
In addition, the overreliance and overuse of this technology has observable negative effects on education and critical thinking skills, not to
m ention the quality of work it produces. It is a cheaply m ade, consum ptive and expensive attem pt to replicate hum an work without paying
hum ans to do it. It will destroy swaths of jobs to replace them  with sm all team s of corrective coders and whatnot, and even if it was good
at its job, or if it eventually im proved--nothing should replace hum ans that does not work to im prove their quality of life. 
AI, as it is now, and as these proposals plan to proliferate it, is an unregulated danger that will disservice and dispose of Am erican
livelihoods. I cannot oppose it enough.
