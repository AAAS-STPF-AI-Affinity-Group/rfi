The importance of verification As a retired research scientist and frequent reviewer of articles 
submitted for publication, I have long appreciated the importance of the citations attached to 
journal papers. Therefore, I applaud the fact the the AI -bot, Perplexity (there may be others) 
provides citations with its answers. This allows the reader (and the reviewer) to assess and verify 
the validity of the statements made in the answer (or article). Therefore, I recommend that 
relevant AI output (answers, summ aries, internet searches and the like) be required to include 
citations. A further step would be to allow (or require, depending on circumstance) "peer review" 
by one or more other AI bots. Such a procedure would minimize the most common problem that 
I and others encounter with the use of AI, namely "hallucination." When we are searching for 
factual information, we need some means to assess what is verifiable and what is not.
