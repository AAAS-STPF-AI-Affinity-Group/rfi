General Comment
AI com panies should not be allowed to utilize other's intellectual property for their own com m ercial gain. AI should not be replacing
hum an jobs so long as hum ans can still do those jobs better. AI should not be used to spy on private citizens without their knowledge
AND consent (nor should they be strong arm ed into consent). AI should not be used to autom ate system s that dem and high accuracy (ie.
weapons system s).
