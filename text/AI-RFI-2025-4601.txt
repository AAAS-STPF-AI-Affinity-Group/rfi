General Comment
AI art is extrem ely overhyped and overall tacky, ugly, and lazy.
It m esses with the livelihoods of hundreds, if not thousands of REAL hum an artists that use their talents to support them selves in such an
already busted econom y. Not to m ention, it’s dangerous as plenty of awful people have already used AI to not only steal from  real artists,
but also scam  and even im personate others through visual AND audio deepfakes.
