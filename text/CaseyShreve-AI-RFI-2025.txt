Just because companies are wealthy doesn’t mean they should be exempt from following established laws. If
copyright, forgery, patent, trademark, or other laws don’t apply to generative AI companies just because they findthe laws inconvenient, the laws then should not apply to any use case by any party.
Coincidentally, there’s cybersecurity concerns with mass exfiltration of data being taken for these training models.Make OpenAI and all generative AI companies pay the people they are currently stealing from. Don’t turn around
and say theft is fine because this company does it. Not that i’m under any illusion that laws are only for us poorpeople to follow, so of course a tech company will be exempt.
