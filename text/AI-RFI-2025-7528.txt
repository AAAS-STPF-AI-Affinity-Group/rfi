General Comment
AI poses a risk to the integrity of art, the integrity of the internet, and the integrity and trustworthiness of inform ation itself. I believe heavy
restrictions should be put in place on what corporations are allowed to train their AI on. I believe training AI on another's work, and then
releasing the output of the AI as if it was your own is equivalent to theft.
