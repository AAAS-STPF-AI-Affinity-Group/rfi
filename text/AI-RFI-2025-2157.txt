General Comment
AI datasets are built on the unchecked theft of everyone's labor and intellectual property. Presum ing this adm inistration truly values
freedom  & equality: if we're going to have generative AI, why don't we do away with copyright laws entirely? If com panies like OpenAI
are entitled to scrape websites, writing, art, m usic, and photography owned by ordinary Am ericans, as well as copyrighted content owned
by other com panies - then it stands to reason the general public should be free to use such "training data" for personal profit as well. Stop
granting AI rights that hum an creators don't have, and liberate all content for everyone.
