General Comment
AI doesn't hold a place in the future of the country. Not in the way you think it does. All it does is steals from  the livelihood of our hard-
working Am erican creatives and proves we need a crutch to do anything artistic or design-worthy. Profit is not worth losing the soul of
Am erican ingenuity. It is m erely an overhyped technology that is fleecing the Am erican public.
