General Comment
The copyright act of 1976 ensures that creators have the rights to their own tangible content and have those rights for their life tim e plus 70
years. This m eans that creators such as artists autom atically have a copyright on their own creations and are able to use and share those
works in anyway for their life tim e plus 70 years. Artists right to their works copyright is infringed and harm ed by generative AI program s
that use artists creation’s unlawfully with out perm ission to train AI. Many artists need to be able to have platform s in m edia such as social
m edia and social settings but AI is taking advantage of these artists creations that are shared to the public. Social platform s such as
instagram  and m eta have been caught secretly stealing data from  their platform ’s users such as m essages and photos, m any especially
com ing from  artists, to train AI which again is not only infringing on such copyright laws here in Am erica but as well goes against our right
to privacy. Instead of training AI, how about we protect our creators, our m edia, our reporters, and our data from  being used illegally and
infringing on basic copyright laws that have been in place for decades.
