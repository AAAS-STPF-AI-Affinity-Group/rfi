General Comment
Hi, I just want to say, please, please don't do this. Copyright law exists for a reason, and allowing specifically AI and only AI to
circum vent it grants a colossal com petitive advantage to people who are already at the top - to the detrim ent of the m ost econom ically
vulnerable of us. If AI is to be the future, then let's keep it ethical - and that includes m oderating its ridiculous energy usage and
considering the livability of our planet. Thanks for reading, and be well.
