Please, please do not allow AI to have access to medical records & national security. Having 
gov't officials have casual access to that data is dangerous and can lead to "lists" of types of 
people being generated based on medical, financial & travel record s. The government has 
already targeted Transgender people, foreigners, and other minorities this year. My fear is that 
the hateful people will make the choice to eradicate anyone they don't understand.
