It is absolutely critical that AI Com panies m ust give notice, get perm ission from , and/or pay fees to copyright holders when their work is
used to train AI. If this fails, then the copyright holders do not get credit or com pensation from  their work, which is protected by
copyright. AI Com panies should not have the right or ability to do their work unethically. And if they cannot do this ethically, they should
