General Comment
Any AI regulation needs to be paired with a clear-eyed understanding of what the technology can do AND what it cannot. For years now
com panies with a vested interest in hyping the theoretical possibilities of AI have inflated the public’s perception of what is possible, when
in reality hallucinations (ie fabricated inform ation) is part and parcel with the prediction engine that is AI. 
There are things that AI is actually am azing at: providing a second look at radiology scans to support hum an doctors, doing a pretty darn
good job at translating text, etc. 
But as with any technology, hum ans should be in the driver’s seat. I cannot em phasize enough how harm ful it would be to allow AI to
“m ake” decisions that affect real world situations, yet we are seeing that from  court cases to em ploym ent already. Don’t let technology
outsource our decisionm aking processes sim ply because it seem s like it m ight save m oney in the short term .
