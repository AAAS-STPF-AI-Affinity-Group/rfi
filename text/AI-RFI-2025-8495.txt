General Comment
The type of AI under discussion is, at the VERY BEST, a frivolous toy, and at worst a com plete drain on society. Maintaining
'dom inance' in this field is a pointless endeavor and will not help Am ericans at all. There is no benefit of any kind to pursuing this
technology, except for industries that wish to not pay hum ans for creative artistic labor. Why should com panies be allowed to have an
exception to copyright law in order to do that?
