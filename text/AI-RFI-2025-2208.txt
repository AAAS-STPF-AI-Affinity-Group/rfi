General Comment
I believe that this proposal will be terrible and detrim ental to every and all creative fields, and that it only serves to benefit corporate
interests for the sake of profit m argins above all else. We need to be following the copyright laws that have been laid down already instead
of creating new ones that will be used for corruption.
