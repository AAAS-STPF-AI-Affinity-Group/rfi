General Comment
AI could never exist without stealing the content its inventers have insisted they need unfettered access to in order to train AI algorithm s.
Those original content creators will never receive paym ent or restitution for their original work if the governm ent allows AI to copy the
original work of creators. This would be disgustingly un-Am erican. If the creators of AI have no other choice but to use original work to
train AI algorithm s, they should pay royalties to the owner every of every piece of original work used to train the algorithm . If AI
com panies can't com ply with the law, then they are running crim inal enterprises and should be disbanded.
