AI is a very powerful tool and as such must be wielded responsibly. I firmly believe any 
development of AI should be done with much care, be it in rules and restrictions. As other foreign countries have set up rules in AI development in their country to protect the safety of their citizens, the same should be done here. AI should be developed only with data that has been shared with consent, and not with anything else, and we should maintain this going forward as it is the work of real American writers, artists, speakers that is being fed into the AI datasets, and it is unfortunately taking away thousands, tens of thousands of jobs from working Americans. We must be very careful in how AI is developed to maximize the welfare  of the American creators, 
and allowing companies and individuals to opt out of sharing their data for AI training is the right way to go, especially to increase the longevity of the disappearing creative jobs.
