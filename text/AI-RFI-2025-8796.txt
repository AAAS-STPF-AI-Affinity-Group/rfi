General Comment
What is there really to say? Cripple m ultiple industries to prop up the tech sector? And not just that, but to help them  chase a trend? Did
we learn nothing from  the NTF craze, and its dem onstrable waste of m oney and resources? Don't com prom ise copyright laws just to
enable the creation of actual garbage. Don't allow talentless hacks to steal from  the hard work of m illions of creatives through the use of
"AI". Sim ple as.
