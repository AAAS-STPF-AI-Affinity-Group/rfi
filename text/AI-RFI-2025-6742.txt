General Comment
No tool nor toolm aker should be above the law. We should not protect art theft. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. As an author, I cannot support anything that steals from  m e and
negates m y copyright. In addition,AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
