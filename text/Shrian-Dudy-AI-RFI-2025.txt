To whom it may concern, As an AI researcher in academia, I propose the following advice: The 
US can be a leader in Participatory AI (PAI) which is what you are doing now. PAI is all about 
soliciting feedback from experts/public on how to shape AI and have a continuous engagement 
with your constituents. What you do here is the first step towards having that conversation. AI is 
a living thing which may not be a one -size fits all. So the next time you ask for input can be on 
several subcategories of AI such as  AI and Education, AI and Healthcare etc. Continuous 
engagement is important since what we think will make the US a leader in AI today may not be 
relevant tomorrow when another DeepSeek -like concept is released. Po.lis is a tool Taiwan is 
using to listen a nd address needs of its people. It reflect to us what we "the people" think and 
help us gather up around shared ideas. Beyond putting the US in the front through comments like 
this, PAI will demonstrate a strong governmental leadership that is fostering a conversation with 
its people. This in turn will increase America's soft power, the one the draws talented people here 
as finally we can find the things on which we agree with each other and get a greater consensus 
on decisions made by the government. Best,  Shiran Dudy
