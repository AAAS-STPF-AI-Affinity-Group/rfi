General Comment
Hello,
I do not believe that AI has a future in the US. It has been m ostly used by m ajor corporations to steal peoples intellectual property and
livelihood. These creatives need to be properly com pensated if their work is being used in any way, including for training AI m odels.
Please do not give com panies like Open AI the full legal authority to use artists, writers, etcâ€™s work without their perm ission.
