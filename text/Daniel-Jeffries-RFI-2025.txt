â€œKeeping America First in AI Through Openness, Innovation, and Unstoppable 
Enterpriseâ€
The United States must solidify its global AI leadership by unleashing free 
enterprise, open collaboration, and American ingenuityâ€”rather than stifling 
innovation with excessive controls. 
Building on our legacy from the transistor to the internet, these 
recommendations ensure America remains first in AI through decentralized 
development, open-source contributions, and allied cooperation.
1. Promote a Robust, Open AI Ecosystem
Encourage Open Source & Collaborative Innovation
- Federal Grant Prioritization: Direct sizable R&D grants toward open-source
AI initiatives. These projects allow entrepreneurs, small businesses, and
academic researchers to rapidly refine and build upon each otherâ€™s work.
- Safe Harbor & Legal Clarity: Create a clear safe harbor for model
developers who share weights, code, and datasets in good faith under open
licenses. Liability concerns surrounding open-source contributions must be
minimized to spur a healthy ecosystem of innovation.
- Preempt State Legislation: Pass a minimal, clear, actionable AI framework
bill that preempts the impossible to comply with patchwork of state
legislation that is strangling AI development in America and creating
uncertainty for our builders and innovators.
2. Safeguard the Right to Learn and Support Fair Use
- Fair Use and Fair Learning Doctrine: Just as we donâ€™t pay a pro athlete
because we learn to throw a football from watching them on TV, AI should be
allowed to train on public data without extortionate fees. Confirm that
training on existing mediaâ€”be it text, images, or videosâ€”remains a
protected form of learning, just as it is for human beings.
- Prevent Price-Gouging: If licensing does occur, it must not exceed the
normal cost, (if a book costs $10, it costs $10 for AI with no new,
extortionate licensing fees tacked on).
3. Encourage Mutual Access Among Allies
- Reciprocal Training Permissions: Incentivize proprietary model makers in
the United States and allied nations to allow training on the outputs of
their closed models, facilitating cross-innovation.
4. Embrace Foreign Open-Source Contributions
- No Restrictions on Foreign Open Source: Avoid limiting access to openly
released models from any sourceâ€”including Chinese research groupsâ€”if the
code and weights are freely and legitimately available. American developers
should be able to refine, align, and adapt such models to uphold and embed
American values.
5. Ensure American Technological Sovereignty in AI
Strengthen Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing
- Tax Incentives & Grants: Extend generous tax breaks and direct incentives
to companies building semiconductor fabs on American soil. This ensures a
stable domestic supply of critical AI hardware, protecting us from overseas
disruptions.
- Risk Mitigation: Recognize the geopolitical risks surrounding Taiwan. The
United States must have robust alternative sources of chips if a regional
conflict disrupts supply chains.
7. Encourage Domestic Rare Earth Extraction
- Priority Mining & Resource Exploration: Offer financial credits and
streamlined permitting for teams that discover and exploit new U.S. based
rare earth mineral deposits, reducing dependence on overseas
suppliersâ€”especially those in adversarial nations.
8. Prioritize Common-Sense Intellectual Property Protections
Empower AI Developers and Human Creators
- Human-in-the-Loop Copyright: Maintain that AI-generated works with
meaningful human input are eligible for copyright. This recognizes both the3/8/2025, Daniel Jeffries


creative contribution of individuals and the new possibilities AI unlocks.
9. Maintain Light-Touch Regulation While Upholding American Values
Reject Overreaching AI â€˜ Alignmentâ€™ Mandates
- Protect Innovation Freedoms: While businesses and research groups naturally
evolve best practices for â€œresponsible AI,â€ the federal government must
not shackle innovators with sweeping requirements or top-down alignment
frameworks that hamper freedom of thought or expression.
- Promote Transparency Through Choice: Rather than forcing uniform
compliance, incentivize companies to publish easy-to-understand documentation
on model function and limitations. This fosters user trust without crushing
creativity.
10. Champion the American Approach to AI
- Decentralized, Not Centralized: Encourage solutions to emergent AI risks
and challenges through market-driven best practices, academic research, and
voluntary industry standards.
- Voluntary Consortiums: Government, industry, and academic stakeholders can
collaborate in voluntary consortiums to create shared normsâ€”especially
around security and reliabilityâ€”without mandating heavy-handed oversight.
Keep America First with Freedom and Openness
With open collaboration, fair use, and minimal regulatory burdens, the AI 
Action Plan ensures America stays first in AI now and in the future.
