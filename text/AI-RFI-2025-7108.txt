General Comment
I need to know how this won't possibly be used by a retributionary adm inistration against the people it has been elected to serve, not to
be served. Especially with our m ost sensitive data being com prom ised by an unelected group of twenty-som ething groypers.
I weep for m y nation. My father fought to defeat the Nazis, and I am  so glad that he did not live to see this day.
