General Comment
As a m usician, author, and creative artist, I have already seen the rapid debasem ent and devaluation of the creative arts, and the
associated destruction of revenue, that AI has wrought. The Artificial Intelligence "industry", such as it is, is based entirely on boosterism ,
hallucinatory valuations, and the utter theft of all content, everywhere, from  private photos, em ails and social m edia posts to the
"consum ption" and regurgitation of the world's great art. If the venture capital cronies wish their unwanted, unnecessary, dubiously
functional AI behem oth to use our work, let them  pay fair m arket value like every other legal user does. If they're unwilling to do that, yet
still take our work, they're com m on thieves. Please stand with creative artists and everyday citizens alike and protect our works from  this
am oral, inhum an exploitation. Thank you.
