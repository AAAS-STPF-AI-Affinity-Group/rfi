General Comment
"Generative artificial intelligence" is created with m ass copyright infringem ent and has no business being legitim ized by any governm ent.
Creators, inventors, and m akers of all kinds have rights to their intellectual property which m ust be safeguarded. Other types of AI m ust
also be carefully scrutinized by experts from  m ultiple types of fields before being accepted into use. While there is a future for AI, we m ust
not rush into it in a hurry to be the biggest or best without considering all the im plications. Generative AI m ade with any m aterial that was
not properly licensed has no right to exist. Stealing and abusing others' property is not suddenly OK because it's done in large quantities or
because a tech com pany just wants to. Com puters cannot think or reason and have no "intelligence" the way a person does, no m atter
how m uch the tech sector would like us to believe they can and do, and so no com puter or digital system  of any kind should ever have
m ore rights than a hum an being does or be held as exem pt from  the sam e laws as hum an beings are in this or any country.
