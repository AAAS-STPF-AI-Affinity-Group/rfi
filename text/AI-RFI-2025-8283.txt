General Comment
As I understand it, the question is whether com panies that are developing LLMs, which we colloquially describe as AI, should be allowed
to ignore copyright law. I do not fully understand the question--the law is the law, and it should be followed. If a business m odel is built on
breaking the law, then com panies should develop a new business m odel. 
These com panies should not be allowed to steal work that belongs to other people and other com panies. It is theft, and in service of
what? AI provides no social good. It is a large-scale scam . Com panies have forced it onto products as part of their general trend of
m aking their products worse. They are not responding to consum er need, they are trying to force AI on us, and then they are trying to
com m it large scale crim es to further develop AI. I cannot see a benefit com ing from  this. 
Even if AI were not based on large-scale copyright violations, it would still not be ethical--it consum es obscene am ounts of power, which
could be better used for a m illion other things.
However, even if AI did not consum e power and dam age the world, even if it was not unethically sourced, even if did not depend on theft
of intellectual property, I STILL would not want it; all it does is badly sum m arize things, with errors introduced, and all students to cheat
on their writing assignm ents. It is dum bing us down as a species. 
In conclusion, I do not feel that LLM com panies should be given a license to steal. Thank you.
