General Comment
AI has huge privacy and plagiarism  concerns and I worry about it stealing livelihood from  everyday Am ericans. This technology looks to
be a bubble sim ilar to NFTs that can pop at any m om ent and I worry that it would not be sound econom ic investm ent. Additionally, it
takes artistic and creative content away from  the creators and aggregates them  without creating anything original. By training on
copyrighted m aterial, it is stealing and plagiarizing the copyright holders and taking away econom ic opportunities. On the privacy
standpoint I worry about its ability to not be hacked or accidentally dissem inate confidential m aterial in its generated content. This has
large privacy im plications for Am erica and Am erican citizens
