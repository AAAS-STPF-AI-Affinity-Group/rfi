General Comment
What this asks to do is steal from  people to m ass produce inferior slop with no understanding of what art even is. Art requires heart, and
no m achine can or should replace that! Real artists, who put m ore effort into each individual line than than one guy at a keyboard writing
som e words into a box, do not deserve to have their jobs stolen by som e code that can barely form  a coherent word.
