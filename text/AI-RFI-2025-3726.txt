General Comment
AI by design operates on a black box, m eaning that not even its engineers fully understands the way in which it trains itself on data. That in
itself creates a situation that dem ands that these com panies are held responsible for their actions in utilizing a technology that has already
destabilized industries in places like China’s illustration sector. 
The so-called “innovations” which AI is capable of are best served in m edical research, solving com plex calculations that actually im prove
hum an quality of life. However, AI is already being leveraged by com panies to steal — yes, steal — copyrighted art and content for
training m odels which then allow these sam e com panies to lay off workers in a field that is already volatile and brutal to work in.
To not hold AI com panies accountable is to directly harm  artists. Directly harm ing artists m eans harm ing the m edia industry, and harm ing
the m edia industry harm s AI. Because what happens when these data m odels run out of hum an-authored content to train on because none
rem ains?
I have dedicated m y life to art across several m edium s. Take it from  an expert — highly regulated AI is only an issue for bad actors who
would destroy jobs, not create them . Real innovation is born from  the labor of hum an hands, not a m indless algorithm  posited as bona fide
intelligence.
