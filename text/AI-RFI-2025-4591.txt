General Comment
Generative AI is costly, in electricity, and resources. It is based on theft of copywrited works, and would cost the incom e of m any of m y
friends, who create art. I oppose the ability of OpenAI and other AI m odels to ignore copywrite, and being given perm ission by the
governm ent to steal our hard earned work.
