General Comment
AI technology wastes electricity on an absolutely staggering scale and runs on the back of plagiarized content com bed through by
im poverished people in other countries paid virtually nothing to look at som e of the worst things hum anity has ever created. It is inherently
unethical.
Even if you don't care about the ethics, bad actors have largely fooled the public into thinking that these are thinking com puters capable of
reacting to dynam ic inputs. This is incorrect. AI program s are system s that are good at guessing the next word in a sentence.
AI integrations have had a negative im pact on alm ost everything they've touched except for the wallets of the tech enthusiasts that have
been pushing for their adoption.
