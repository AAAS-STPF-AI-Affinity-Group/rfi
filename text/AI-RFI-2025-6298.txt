General Comment
OpenAI should not have access to im m unity to any lawsuits pertaining to copyrighted m aterial and AI in all does not hold a place in the
United States governm ent. Allowing OpenAI to be im m une to copyright infringem ent lawsuits would open the floodgates for all other AI
com panies to essentially steal jobs from  people and artists on an even higher level than already present, with countless peoples livelihoods
being harm ed in the process. People will get laid off, people will be fired from  their jobs, and people will be replaced by a soulless
m achine and com panies will attem pt to profit off of that fact. OpenAI should have no involvem ent with the governm ent and should never
have any im m unity to lawsuits that com e their way due to their LLM stealing peoples work and bastardizing it for a profit.
