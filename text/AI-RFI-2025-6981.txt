General Comment
Artificial Intelligence as prom oted by OpenAI does not have any place in our lives. It is nothing m ore than a plagiarism  m achine that aim s
to steal inform ation and data from  people while sim ultaneously consum ing resources that should be protected. It is essential that AI is not
allowed to be im m une to copyright law as it profits off of theft. I believe that the recent exam ple of DeepSeek has dem onstrated that no
one in charge of "AI" has any idea what they are doing and are sim ply using this tool as a m eans to steal m oney, resources, and rights from
every one else.
