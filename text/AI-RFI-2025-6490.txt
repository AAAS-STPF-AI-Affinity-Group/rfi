General Comment
Giving AI this m uch power is a terrible, dangerous idea. We have seen that AI is not capable of parsing inform ation in the sam e way that
hum ans can, and that the m istakes it m akes when used to do things like flagging people for terrorism  watch lists can be devastating. Do
not give AI this kind of power.
