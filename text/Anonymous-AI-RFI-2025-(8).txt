I do not want any leeway given to AI. It is currently built on mountains of stolen work to fuel a 
product that generates zero to negative value for either the economy or civilian life. Either force them to pay for the right to use other peoples writing, ar t, music, etc. Or outright ban their 
existence. I cannot and will not support any politician or organization that sanctions such rampant theft of peoples hard work. If it cannot exist without stealing, then it shouldn't exist.
