General Comment
I am  writing this note as an individual to urge the adm inistration to not got forward with the AI action plan until they provide a plan to help
out sm all creators and businesses. Google and OpenAI are asking the governm ent let them  train on copyrighted work even if they don't
own that m aterial. Allowing them  to train on copyrighted works does not let sm all creators and businesses to prosper, but instead, die out
as bug tech controls those works, never allowing new ideas to grow and prosper. And this will have dire effect on the econom y as local
businesses cannot com pete with the wave of m assive stolen works created by generative AI. Stealing creative works from  am ericans to
train ai is unam erican and it will not help us beat China in this AI arm s race we are at right now.
I urge the adm inistration to reconsider, and work with the am erican businesses and creators on how to advance with this ai plan, even
have options available for them  if they want to opt out of the ai plan.
Thank you for your tim e.
