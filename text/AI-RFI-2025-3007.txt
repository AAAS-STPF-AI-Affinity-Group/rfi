General Comment
AI can be used for good, but copyrighted m aterials, IPs and creative works m ust be protected at all costs. AI Generated Art/Music and
other creative works are built upon m odels of stolen work. People spend a lifetim e m astering their trade only for those at the wheel of AI
m odels to steal their talent and call it their own. AI could be used to benefit com m unities and peoples lives but the current im plem entation
across the board fails to account for the Hum an elem ent. Nothing created today in term s of AI Art is an original piece of work. The
people behind "AI Art" would have you believe that because they were able to spin up a service to produce this "AI Art" that they are
now the owners of what it produces, however how can that be true if it was essentially stolen goods? It's cheating. You wouldn't let
som eone cheat on a test right in front of you and give them  a passing grade would you? This is that. This is cheating, it's theft and a lack of
actual hard work to becom e an "artist". Protect artist. Reject AI as it is now. All it does is drain resources and consum es electricity that
could be better spent elsewhere. AI as it is now, is harm ing the world. It is harm ing Am erica.
