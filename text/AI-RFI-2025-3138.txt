General Comment
If anything m ore restrictions are needed on AI. It has been around for som e tim e without the law being able to catch up to it fully and has
been a part of cases big and sm all that continue to set precedents on it. While AI m ight be a part of the future it should not be freely done,
on a m ore ethical note it takes jobs from  other people and it lim its the need for critical thinking skills and expertise from  people and
ultim ately can lead to a lot of bad outcom es without anyone checking it. If you don’t believe m e then you can search up when AI was
used to try and find breast cancer and instead identified cancer by the photos logos, if no one was there to have the already existing
expertise it’s very possible no one would have caught that and m any people would get false negatives. Yes laws inhibit the speed of AI
but that isn’t a bad thing, we as a country have low STEM scores, degree levels, reading levels, career opportunities so let’s at least try to
push Am ericans forward before we cut hum ans out of the equation
