Executive  Summary  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at the forefront of global technological transformation, driving 
advancements in automation, decision -making, and large -scale data processing. However, 
these innovations come at a cost —AI development and deployment require significant 
computational power, leading to  high energy consumption, carbon emissions, and 
environmental impact.  
The emergence  of a compute  marketplace, where computing power  is traded as a commodity, 
has raised concerns about unregulated energy usage, inefficient compute distribution, and 
sustainability.  The recent  article  in The Wall  Street  Journal  titled  "AI Needs  a Lot of Computing 
Power—Is a Market for Compute the Next Big Thing?" highlights the growing demand for 
computational resources and the risks associated with excessive consumption, cost inflation, 
and lack of accountability .1 
This whitepaper  outlines  the need  for an international  standard  to govern  resource -efficient  AI 
software and compute usage. The  proposed ISO standard  aims to establish  benchmarks for 
energy -efficient AI workloads, standardize carbon measurement methods, and encourage 
sustainable AI development practices.

3   WHITEPAPER:  ESTABLISHING  STANDARDS  FOR  RESOURCE -EFFICIENT  AI 
SOFTWARE & COMPUTE MANAGEMENT  
 
 
1. The Compute  Market  & Rising  AI Energy  Demands  
1.1 Growth  of Compute -as-a-Commodity  
With AI models requiring  massive computational resources, companies are turning to  cloud 
providers,  specialized  AI chips  (GPUs/TPUs),  and decentralized  compute markets.  While  this 
offers accessibility, it also introduces:  
• Unregulated  energy  consumption,  leading  to higher  carbon  emissions.  
• Market  inefficiencies,  where  demand  outstrips  supply,  inflating  costs.  
• Lack of transparency, as AI developers have  no standardized benchmarks  for energy - 
efficient computing.  
1.2 Environmental  & Economic  Challenges  
The AI industry’s  compute  demand  is unsustainable  without  regulation.  Key concerns  include:  
• Excessive carbon footprint : Training an advanced AI model can consume as much  
energy as five cars over their lifetime.2 
• Cooling & heat waste : High -performance GPUs generate  significant heat, increasing 
cooling costs for data centers.  
• Unfair  access : Smaller  AI companies  struggle  to afford  expensive  compute  
resources, widening the AI divide.  
 
 
2. The Role  of a Global  Standard  for Resource -Efficient  AI 
Software  
A resource -efficient  AI standard  is crucial  for guiding  AI developers,  cloud  providers,  and 
policymakers in sustainable compute usage. The proposed standard aims to:  
2.1 Setting  Efficiency  Benchmarks  
• Define  power  usage  metrics for  AI model training  (e.g.,  kWh  per epoch).  
• Establish guidelines  for GPU/TPU  energy  efficiency,  reducing  unnecessary 
computation.

cars in their lifetimes . MIT Technology  Review.  Available  at: 
https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/239031/training -a-single -ai-model -can-emit-as-much -carbon -  
as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/  

4  2.2 Standardizing  Energy  & Carbon  Measurement  
• Create  universal  reporting  methods  for AI compute  emissions.  
• Introduce  Carbon  Usage  Effectiveness  (CUE)  & Power  Usage  Effectiveness  (PUE) 
standards.  
2.3 Optimizing  Software -Hardware  Interaction  
• Encourage  low-energy  AI model  designs  (e.g.,  model  pruning,  quantization).  
• Promote  resource -aware cloud  AI deployment to  minimize  redundant  compute cycles.  
2.4 Supporting  Policymakers  & Regulators  
• Provide  a framework  for sustainable  AI governance in  compute -intensive  applications.  
• Help  governments  align  AI policies  with United  Nations  Sustainable  Development 
Goals (SDGs).  
 
 
3. Addressing  the Compute  Market:  Regulation  vs. Innovation  
While  the compute  market  provides flexibility  for AI companies,  it lacks  transparency  and 
sustainability mechanisms. The proposed standard would help:  
1. Prevent overconsumption : Companies would optimize  compute allocation  to reduce 
unnecessary AI workloads.  
2. Create  fairer  access : Standardized  efficiency  benchmarks  help smaller  AI firms 
compete without excessive compute costs.  
3. Encourage  sustainable  AI investments : Investors  & cloud  providers  favor  green - 
compliant AI models, reducing carbon emissions.  
 
 
4. The Path  Forward:  Implementing  a Resource -Efficient  AI 
Standard  
4.1 Collaboration  with  Standards  Bodies  
• Work with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) on  ISO/IEC JTC 
1/SC 39 (Sustainability for IT)  & ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 (AI Standards) to formalize 
energy -efficient AI software metrics.  
• Engage  AI cloud  providers  (AWS,  Google  Cloud,  Microsoft  Azure)  to implement  best 
practices in sustainable AI deployment.  
4.2 Industry  & Government  Adoption  
• Encourage  data centers  to comply  with AI sustainability benchmarks.  
• Advocate for  AI compute efficiency policies  similar to  energy efficiency standards in 
hardware.  

5  4.3 Next  Steps  
• Develop  an open -source benchmarking  tool for  AI compute  efficiency.  
• Publish  a technical  guideline  for AI engineers  on energy -efficient coding.  
• Seek  collaboration  with AI industry  leaders,  cloud  providers,  and policymakers.  
 
 
5. Conclusion  & Call to Action  
AI computing demands will continue to grow, but without  standardized governance, the 
environmental impact will  escalate unsustainably. A  global standard for resource -efficient AI 
software is critical to:  
• Ensure  energy -efficient  AI development.  
• Regulate  the compute  marketplace  to avoid  resource  overconsumption.  
• Encourage  transparent reporting  of AI compute  emissions.  
Policymakers, AI researchers, and industry leaders must act now to  establish standards that 
balance innovation with sustainability. By adopting  resource -efficient AI software practices, 
we can drive responsible AI development while minimizing its environmental footprint.
