General Comment
DO NOT REVOKE Executive Order 14110 of October 30, 2023 (Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Developm ent and Use of Artificial
Intelligence.). Som etim es, I think that the people running our governm ent right now have absolutely no brain cells. Do not m ake OpenAI
im m une from  copyright infringem ent. That would be absolutely stupid. Use your brains for once in your life. You went to school. You
were taught to think. I'm  assum ing you got a degree from  a university. So use that big, hopefully wrinkly brain of yours and do not revoke
EO 14110 of October 30, 2023. Don't be sm oothbrain.
