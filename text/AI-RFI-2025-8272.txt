General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. AI is a dead end technology at the end of its hype cycle. Com panies and
investors are throwing m oney at this tool hoping to stum ble onto a way to m ake m oney; none have succeeded so far and new m odels
show that building bigger m odels yields fewer and fewer returns.
