General Comment
Do not give OpenAI and other AI com panies a pass to steal whatever they please. I’ve painted painting, I’ve written short stories, and
I’m  just a guy with a m enial part tim e job. If I put m yself out there, and an AI com pany steals from  m e, I won’t be able to fight back.
Please, I’m  begging you, don’t give AI this power over us all.
