General Comment
Under no circum stances should AI be trained on copyrighted m aterial without receiving the perm ission of, and adequately com pensating,
the owner of copyright. Both copyright and patent protections are written in the Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8) explicitly to
“prom ote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” This is how we foster and m aintain Am erican leadership in science and technology, so
current copyright laws should be strictly followed and enforced.
