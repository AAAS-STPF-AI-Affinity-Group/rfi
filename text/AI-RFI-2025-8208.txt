General Comment
As an artist, Open AI and its equivalents and products created using sim ilar databanks harm  m y livelyhood. Generative AI steals potential
jobs from  m e. This is before getting into the m assive breach of copyright and IP law.
Allowing Open AI to freely scrape the internet of any posted art will hurt artists of all sorts.
