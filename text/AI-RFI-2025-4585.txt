General Comment
Al steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. It has absolutely no place in the future of Am erica. Generative AI is
explicitly anti Am erican. As an Am erican citizen I deplore the use of AI as all it has done is exploit hard working class citizens through
taking away our jobs.
