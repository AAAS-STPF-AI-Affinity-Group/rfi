Re: National Science Foundation’s Request for Information on the Development of an
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
I am an everyday American who has a long relationship with the arts. I have worked hard
for years to develop the skills and knowledge to one day enter the industry, and thedangers of AI provide a direct threat to the future of me and many others.
The AI systems made by Big Tech companies like OpenAI (Microsoft) and Google
threaten to destroy thousands of American small businesses with their recentdemand to create special carve outs in copyright law.
AI systems can only be produced by first training on work made by people. The work of
hundreds of thousands of other everyday American creators was taken and fed into theseAI systems without consent or any compensation. They ingest work, reassemble it, andthen sell it back to clients – directly competing with people and cutting them out of themarketplace.
Now these Big Tech companies are asking this administration to create exceptions and
loopholes to make this practice of stealing American creators’ copyrighted work legalprecedent. They are suggesting that if a machine ingests and reproduces copyrighted work,it is somehow suddenly “fair use”.
 
They seem to believe that anything and everything on the internet – regardless of whoowns it – should be theirs for the taking. They claim that if this administration does not allowthem to rewrite the law in this way, it will stifle American innovation.
Instead, it will have the opposite effect. The purpose of American copyright law is to
protect the incentive to create and innovate.
 
If we the American people do not own our creations, and everything we put online will bestolen by Big Tech giants, what will be the incentive to create? If everyday Americans


create a new innovative piece of computer code, a new visual design, or a new piece of
music only to have it immediately stolen by Google and Microsoft, why bother creating it in
the first place? How will we possibly make a living doing these things?
Want to protect American innovation? Protect American creators. Do not create new
copyright exemptions that allow Big Tech companies to exploit and steal from
creators and everyday Americans without permission, compensation, ortransparency.
This administration’s AI Action Plan should focus not on giving away creator content to Big
Tech companies, but rather on ensuring a fair marketplace with competition:
First, the government should ensure that creators and everyday Americans give  
effective consent, so that we can decide when and where our work is used by AI 
systems.
Second, the AI Action Plan should encourage a robust licensing marketplace, so 
that the incentive to create for small businesses is preserved. Our work has immense  
economic value, so the value generated by that work should accrue to the original  
creators, not just Big Tech.
Finally, the AI Action Plan should require transparency from Big Tech companies, 
requiring them to disclose what material is in their training datasets, and label what  
content is AI generated.
We should not sacrifice the hard work of hundreds of thousands of Americans and give it
away to Big Tech by rewriting copyright law.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on these important issues.
