General Comment
I find the AI Action Plan to be ridiculous. Am erica has always faced governm ents and entities who use less than honorable m ethods to
achieve their goals and has never had to stoop to the sam e lack of standards. Our rights as citizens should include the right to m onetize our
own artwork without som e corporate entity stealing it and profiting from  our hard work and creativity. Our art is like gold and you are
having a plastic race expecting us to dim inish the quality and value of our work 
Sincerely, an Am erican artist
