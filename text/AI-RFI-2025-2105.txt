General Comment
Generative AI is an im m ensely dangerous technology that will do nothing if not ruin the creative industry and threaten the integrity of the
internet as a whole. We are already seeing an obscene flood of m isinform ation and abuse of GenAI technology to steal the work of
creatives and im personate people both living and dead across the web, and any efforts to continue expanding on what this technology can
do will only com pound the issue further. The use of AI outside of greatly restricted scientific application is irresponsible and can only do
far m ore harm  than good.
