General Comment
OpenAI and other com panies have publicly stated that their m odels, the thing around which they have constructed their entire business
m odel, cannot function without using copyrighted m aterial.
Copyright exists to prevent artist's work from  being stolen or recreated without their perm ission or consent.
If generative artificial intelligence cannot create artwork without stealing the core com ponents from  other, copyright-protected sources,
then the act of using generative AI to produce art constitutes an act of copyright infringem ent. Or to put it m ore sim ply, their business
m odel is based on theft.
This business m odel is inherently illegal. Businesses that operate using illegal m ethods should not be perm itted to do business in this
country or any other.
