General Comment
I firm ly believe that copyright laws MUST apply to any m aterials used to train AI m odels. While AI is useful, it depends on novel work
m ade by hum ans. Work that has been historically produced with the understanding that the owner retains the rights to use and m ake
m oney off that work. If an AI can copy the hom ework of hardworking Am ericans for free, it would undercut the value of creating new
work for the AI m odels to continue to train on. Who would pay for the labor needed to create new works? I firm ly believe these
copyright protections in the case of AI training are good for skilled laborers, good for the AI m odels, and good for Am erica. Please think
carefully before giving away som eone else's work for free. Thank you very m uch for reading.
