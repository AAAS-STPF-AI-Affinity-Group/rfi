General Comment
The term  "AI" is being thrown around like candy as the hot new piece of technology everyone wants in on. That said, generative AI is
harm ful to the populace. It harm s jobs in all creative fields with rippling effects elsewhere. There are m ore and m ore stories appearing
where people are wrongfully accused of utilizing AI for writing or drawing. It creates an environm ent of a witch hunt- one which m ay
cause devastating effects to the digital era. We cannot close Pandora's box but we can begin to create a safety net via regulations to
prevent further dam age. 
And for those unconcerned because "it only effects artists" then do a Google search and see how m uch inform ation com es up incorrect or
influenced otherwise by AI. Our m ere ability to locate inform ation is at risk and that will harm  us. It is already causing trouble in the school
system .
