General Comment
Artificial intelligence is both an engine for the theft of intellectual property on an unim aginable scale and a scam  based on using stolen
intellectual property and exploiting poorly paid laborers who are used to sim ulate com puter generated responses to queries. It is m orally
bankrupt, ethically wrong, too expensive to provide a viable return on investm ent, and both incredibly and increasingly unsustainable in its
use of energy and water. It is clum sy and inefficient, and does not deliver enough to justify the waste it generates.
