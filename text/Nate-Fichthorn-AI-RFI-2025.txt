Hello,
"AI" companies making LLMs and image generators should not be exempt from copyright
law.  The utilities that they create are not very valuable, and are certainly not worth enabling
global scale theft.
In addition, LLMs and image generators are not "AI", and will not result in any kind of
general AI, so are definitely not worth destroying so much human work for.
Thank you,
- Nate Fichthorn
