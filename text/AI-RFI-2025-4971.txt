General Comment
I am  a digital artist. I've been drawing since I was 5 years old. I'm  alm ost 35 now and I am  passionate about drawing. It brings m e joy
that I can create a piece of art that m akes others happy. I do not want to lose that feeling and passion but hearing that this bill even exists
is appalling and an insult to artists everywhere. We do not want our work plagiarized by hum an or m achine. Com panies should not be
able to use our artwork for AI training. It m akes m e feel like the com panies are too cheap to afford artists and have to rely on m achine
m ade im agery which m akes m e feel that their end result is unreliable and a bad product. Com puters cannot think of anything new. They
have to rely on input from  som ething else to be able to create and that would m ean art, audio and text would have to be used, and those
things have to com e from  som ewhere, another person's creation. As an artist, I want to create things m yself and not have to rely on a
m achine to do everything like how people relied on com puters in WALL-E. We do not need AI to create. We have creative people out
there who m ake so m any wonderful things out there to show to the world that we love what we do. We do not need AI for that because
the feeling of joy when creating cannot be replicated by com puters. I do not wish for this bill to be passed and artists everywhere, as well
as m y self, want this veto'd
