General Comment
This technology is theft m anifest. It freely collects and uses the work of others without their consent or com pensation for their, tim e, skill
and work. People try and argue that "it's a tool". Tools can be used to com m it crim es, tools can be used to kill, and this is both a crim e
and killing one of the last freedom s hum ans have: creativity. It is plagiarism . It is stealing. It needs to be shut down.
