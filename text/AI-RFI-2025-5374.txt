General Comment
AI is thievery. AI is not hard working. AI is cheap and unsafe and has been confirm ed to jeopardize and poison itself. Anyone can bypass
AI and see right through it. It is nothing but a passing trend and has no place in the livelihoods of the Am erican people. Porn sick
pedophiles use OpenAI to generate explicit content of children to fulfill disgusting fantasies, why would I ever want this integrated into
national security or the entertainm ent industry in Am erica?
