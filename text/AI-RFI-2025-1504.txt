 Re:  Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
 Action Plan 
 Dear Mr. D’Souza, 
 The Ethical Web Data Collection Initiative (EWDCI) appreciates the opportunity to submit 
 comments in response to the above-referenced Request for Information (RFI) regarding the 
 development of an AI Action Plan. EWDCI is a coalition of industry stakeholders dedicated to 
 promoting responsible and ethical AI data governance, aligning AI policy with principles of 
 transparency, fairness, and accountability. Our work emphasizes and promotes the ethical 
 collection and use of web data in AI model development, ensuring that innovation does not 
 come at the cost of fundamental rights, privacy, or fairness. 
 Foundations and Core Principles 
 EWDCI recognizes and appreciates the Administration’s goal of reducing regulatory burdens to 
 encourage AI innovation. We generally support deregulation as a means to foster innovation 
 and economic growth. However, we urge that this approach be undertaken thoughtfully and 
 strategically to ensure that critical safeguards for transparency, accountability, and data privacy 
 remain intact. A balanced approach to AI governance will support sustainable growth while 
 mitigating the risks associated with unregulated AI deployment. Our recommendations focus on 
 three core principles: 
 1. Transparency and Explainability  : AI models should  be designed with mechanisms for
 public accountability and explainability. The AI Action Plan should support policies that

 ensure the provenance and integrity of training data, preventing the misuse of ethically 
 questionable or proprietary datasets. 
 2. Data Privacy and Security  : AI systems must incorporate  robust privacy safeguards
 from the outset. The AI Action Plan should encourage privacy-preserving AI techniques
 such as differential privacy, federated learning, and robust encryption measures to
 ensure that user data is not exploited.
 3. International Collaboration and Standardization  : Given  AI’s global nature, U.S.
 leadership should focus on aligning domestic AI policies with international ethical
 standards, ensuring that AI regulations are interoperable with frameworks such as
 UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of AI.
 Specific Recommendations 
 1. Open Data and Ethical AI Development
 The AI Action Plan should prioritize policies that promote transparent data sourcing, including
 clear documentation of training datasets. Undocumented, biased, or ethically questionable data
 sources undermine trust in AI and increase risks of misinformation and discrimination.
 2. Risk Mitigation and Model Accountability
 To ensure AI models do not propagate harm, policies should require:
 ● Risk assessments  for high-impact AI systems, particularly  those used in hiring,
 healthcare, and criminal justice.
 ● Independent audits  of AI training datasets to prevent  data misuse and reinforce ethical
 AI governance.
 ● Clear redress mechanisms  for individuals and organizations  negatively affected by
 AI-driven decisions.
 ● Transparency in content moderation and censorship  :  Policies should ensure that
 any censorship or content moderation by AI systems is transparent, subject to
 independent review, and does not unduly restrict lawful expression.
 3. Responsible AI Innovation
 ● The AI Action Plan should support responsible AI innovation by encouraging
 open-source AI frameworks that adhere to ethical data collection practices.
 ● Government-funded AI research should emphasize fairness, bias mitigation, and
 inclusive data practices, ensuring that underrepresented communities are not
 disproportionately impacted by AI systems.
 Conclusion 
 EWDCI appreciates OSTP and NITRD NCO’s efforts to gather stakeholder input in shaping the 
 AI Action Plan. We strongly support deregulation as a tool for fostering innovation, but stress 
 that such an approach must be coupled with safeguards to protec t ethical AI development and 
 data privacy. By prioritizing ethical AI data governance, transparency, and international 
 collaboration, the United States can lead in AI development while safeguarding public trust. We

 look forward to continued engagement in these discussions and stand ready to support efforts to 
 create a balanced, ethical, and sustainable AI ecosystem.
