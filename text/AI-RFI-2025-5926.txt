General Comment
I do not believe that AI in it currently state is viable enough to help national security overall. Much of current m odels are trained on
inform ation and im ages whose creators are not fairly com pensated. I believe continuing down this path will ultim ately result in a dim inished
national security and society as we will forsake the ingenuity and creativeness that com es from  hum an effort, resulting in a stillted overall
society and a national security unable to quickly deal with threats or have inaccurate assessm ent on situations due to inaccurate or junk
data fed to the AI algorithm s.
