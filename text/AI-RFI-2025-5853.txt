General Comment
As a writer, m y words are m y product. I license their use. I will never consent to m y product being freely appropriated, stolen, used to
train AI, and fed into a schem e to profit via theft. Without m y consent to license m y work, AI use and training is, by definition, theft and
infringem ent on both intellectual property and m y livelihood as an Am erican. Even when com pensation is offered, I decline to license m y
work to com panies using artificial intelligence.
If OpenAI or any AI or Large Language Model accesses, processes, or trains on m y work, I currently have standing to sue to block this
illegal use. I should not have to do that; they should not access it in the first place. But the governm ent m ust not rem ove the ability for
businesses or individuals to retain their copyright, or to seek legal rem edies when products are stolen from  us.
AI access, processing, and training should be opt-in only.
