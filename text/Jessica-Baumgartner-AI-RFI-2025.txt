I don't want AI in my appliances. I don't want AI in my home, or my community, or my 
government. AI is artificial. It is not a biological creature and has no place on this planet. 
Artificial intelligence can only do what it is programmed to do, and that ca n easily be corrupted. 
No matter what good intentions this action plan may be filled with it will pave the road to hell.
