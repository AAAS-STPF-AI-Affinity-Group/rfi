General Comment
Generative AI is not a boon to the US econom y or to US security, it is a plague. Its energy requirem ents are ravaging the US power grid
and calling for even m ore reckless expenditure of precious resources, accelerating the incidence of clim ate disasters. It is destroying the
livelihoods of m illions of skilled individuals by literally stealing their work in order to process and regurgitate inferior and inaccurate copy.
It is underm ining the cognitive abilities of US citizens by elim inating critical thinking and creative skill acquisition. It is m orally, logistically,
and intellectually wrong to pursue this technology without stringent regulations to protect the environm ent and the people whose work is
being exploited. The m otive behind this action is pure greed and laziness and ought not be tolerated, m uch less debated. Do not m ake it
easier for these AI developers to run their destructive scam  on this country.
