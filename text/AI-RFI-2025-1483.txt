General Comment
f&^% generati ve ai. this s&^% steals from creati ves and disincentivizes anyone from actual ly making someth ing unique from 
their ow n merit and skill. generati ve ai should not be normal ized. we will regress hundreds, if not thousan ds of years of 
creati vity and freedom of expression . this is not the renaissan ce you think it will be. this is destructi ve.
