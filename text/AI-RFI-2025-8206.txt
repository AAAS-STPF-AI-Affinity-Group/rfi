General Comment
AI is sim ply the newest tool being pushed by big tech com panies to take decisions out if hum an hands. Im agine working weeks or even
m onths on som ething and having it taken and given back to you broken and tam pered with, this is what AI does to hard working hum an
beings. If you care about owning what you m ake, what you put your blood, sweat, and tears into, AI cannot be allowed to continue as it
has. It is nothing but a com puter program  taking and taking and giving nothing in return but responses that 'look' right, but after closer look
are full of garbage and holes. 
AI cannot be allowed to train on copywritten works, it is just taking things from  hard working people, be it every day Am ericans or big
com panies like Disney, or people in other countries. All AI does is take what you love and bastardize it into som ething unrecognizable.
There is no reason, absolutely no good, valid reason, to let AI run ram pant as it is and will continue to do.
