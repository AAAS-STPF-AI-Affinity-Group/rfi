General Comment
As an artist and write, part of m y livelihood is at risk due to AI generation. Thousands of others who bled and sweat and shed tears for
their craft, whether working independently or part of a greater creative industry, will lose em ploym ent opportunities. AI generated works
are not the results of tools wielded by the creative hum an spirit, but by a soulless construct that steals from  the labor of others and m ashes
it together into an uninspired and unrequired waste of data processing. Im ages, writing and m usic generated by these program s should not
be protected by copyright. Not now, not ever.
