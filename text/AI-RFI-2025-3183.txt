General Comment
I oppose this action plan. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. I do not consent to m y data as an Am erican to be scraped and used
in an AI database, m y data and personal works are m y own and to scrape them  would be infringing on m y work hindering m y business
prospects. I also believe the utility of AI is overstated, especially in relation to the dam ages it will inflict upon United States citizens.
