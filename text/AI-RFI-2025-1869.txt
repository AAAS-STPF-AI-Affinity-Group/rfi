General Comment
Both as a creative and as a scientist, I oppose the developm ent of so-called "AI." It plagiarizes the work of others to create subpar work
while living creators struggle. Furtherm ore, the environm ental im pact could never be worth it. Support living people, protect the
environm ent we live in, don't allow corporations to profit from  plagiarism  at the expense of either.
