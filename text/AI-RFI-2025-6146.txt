General Comment
No m ore AI slop. Every day on m y way to work I pass by huge advertisem ents in the subway m ade with AI-generated art and it fills m e
with absolute rage and disgust. We have to want better for each other as hum an beings and not surrender our hearts and m inds to an
algorithm . We have to want to think. We have to want to dream . AI joined with the power of unregulated hypercapitalism  will rend our
souls from  us. Please don't let this com e to pass. Thanks!
