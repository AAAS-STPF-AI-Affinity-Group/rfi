General Comment
If this plan goes through and OpenAI is given full freedom  to steal from  whatever it wants, it will not only cripple the livelihoods of artists
and creators everywhere, but it will also result in a cultural landscape that is less unique, less creative, less rich, and less enjoyable. If
OpenAI becom es a dom inant force in the creative industries, the art and m edia we consum e will becom e hom ogenized until it ceases to
have all m eaning. 
People already com plain about the state of the film  industry, but im agine how m uch worse it will be if ChatGPT frankensteins every script
together into an incom prehensible m ess.
People have com plained about the idea of "bread and circuses," and how the current adm inistration doesn't even seem  interested in
allowing us to have those. The least they can do is not allow OpenAI to strangle the arts and m edia that we do have.
