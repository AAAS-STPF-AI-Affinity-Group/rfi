General Comment
To Whom  it m ay concern,
As a hum an being in the creative sector, m y incom e relies on copyright rem aining a strong tenant of the Am erican econom y. It is m y belief,
as I know it is for m ost in the industry, that allowing AI com panies to continue to freely steal our data and our creative outputs (an integral
sector of the econom y!), will do irreparable dam age not only to Am erica's standing as a global creative leader, but on an individual level,
to our incom es.
Independent contractors like m e already pay m uch higher taxes for the 'luxury' of doing our jobs. If our livelihoods are destroyed by giving
over all of our work to a handful of com panies, it would undercut the m iddle and lower incom e classes, leaving us even m ore unable to
keep up with inflation.
We're already drowning. Do not allow AI com panies to hold our heads under the water.
Thank you.
