General Comment
This is nothing but unchecked corruption. They seek im m unity because they know what they are doing is theft and would not fly in court.
Trum p is selling your data and livelihood to the highest bidder. Every industry that relies on IP and copyrighted works is gravely
threatened by this order. This isn't just about indie artists anym ore. Disney, Param ount, the entire film  and m usic industries will be greatly
dam aged. This order is not, and never will be, necessary for AI com panies or technologies. It has absolutely nothing to do with national
security. These are blatant lies and there was not even an attem pt to m ake them  look convincing in the slightest. That's how confident
Trum p is in his power. I urge you, especially those harm ed m ost by this order, to oppose it. Do not stand by while this illegal and im m oral
behavior happens. You have the power to stop it.
