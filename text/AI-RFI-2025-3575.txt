General Comment
Are y’all freaking serious? Can y’all stop letting corporat ions gut us for everything that makes us human? We S HOULD be protected  
from open AI and all its ilk, and we SHOULD have the right to force co mpanies to respect individuals’ intellectual propert y. This country 
is so goddamn embarrass ing. Do something in favor of your actual living breat hing citizens for once, you sp ineless co inpurses. J ust 
because you’ve given up your souls does n’t mean you have to force t he rest of us to do t he same. 
This technology does nothing but steal from real humans, blend it up, and deliver an unappet izing mush. It has no character, a nd it has 
been doc umented as making humans slower and dumber at t heir own cognitive tasks. This does n’t even touch the environmental harm that 
these tec hnologies leave in their wake. These tec hnologies’ act ive and existing cons outweigh their theoretical pros by an astro nomical 
amount. Allowing these corporat ions to run around unchecked will be vilified in history, if humans survive the extinction event that they’re 
driving, that is.
Buncha f&^% moronic vam pires.
