Any AI action plan should make it a priority to protect the intellectual property rights of artists
and creators. There is plenty of work to be done by AI that does not involve stealing andregurgitating the works of individual artists. Their work should not be stolen and ingested.
Instead AI should focus on such things as dynamic line ratings to improve the power grid, or
to improve the speed of materials science research. Even there AI should not be allowed tosteal copyrighted works and documents.
