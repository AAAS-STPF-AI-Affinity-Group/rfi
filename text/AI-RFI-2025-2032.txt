General Comment
I do not believe Generative AI has any benefit to the future of the United States of Am erica. If anything, I believe it will only serve to
hinder growth and learning abilities, as well as cause m assive power outages due to the absurd am ount of power generative AI requires to
work. Stricter rules and regulations need to be in place to safeguard the Am erican people from  the negative aspects of generative AI.
