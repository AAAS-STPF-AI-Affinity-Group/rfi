General Comment
As an author, I can say without a doubt that the "rights" of com panies owning AI technology DO NOT supersede the rights of creatives -
authors, artists, etc. AI should NOT have the "right" to be trained using copyrighted works without the express consent of the copyright
owner. No hum an being on this planet is exem pt from  these laws, and to suggest that a com puter program  - and those that own it - CAN
violate these sam e laws is not only laughable, but crim inal. DO NOT allow AI com panies to be above the law. DO NOT allow backdoor
access to free use of copyrighted m aterial. Presidential EO's are NOT the law, nor should som ething as inane as this becom e the law.
