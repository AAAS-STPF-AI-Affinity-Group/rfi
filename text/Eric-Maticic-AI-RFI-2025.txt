A humble request: Please ensure that every data element to fall under the scope of AI has a 
"Validated Formal Requirement" that can be traced to a current organizational doctrine.Too many 
times, system development gets rushed and the "How" is put before th e "What". The United States 
Marine Corps did well with this, Defining the Requirements always came first. Here at HUD we 
struggle because the Orders and Directives that drive our data is not as clearly standardized and 
defined. One Department can say "Prop erty" and the count will differ based on the inferred 
departmental meaning. Our information is limited to our interpretations when data is not clearly 
defined and standardized. This will exponentially worsen if AI algorythms are structured towards 
the same  ambiguity. Every Data Element must be traced to a formal validated requirement, that can 
be verified in a specific policy and data element dictionary style appendix. Once this process is 
standardized and consistent, and commonalities are made; AI can flou rish accurately.
