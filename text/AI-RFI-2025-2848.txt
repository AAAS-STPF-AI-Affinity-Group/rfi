General Comment
AI negatively affects m y friends' livelihoods as creatives and I do not see the value gained from  m any of the current things generative AI is
trying to do. Social m edia is flooded with false inform ation and m isinform ation that uses AI im ages. I do not think the USA has m uch use
for AI and I sincerely hope this does not pass. It would be disastrous, just like how AI already has been for this country. So m any people
do not know the difference between AI and real im ages already.
