General Comment
AI is a significant drain on local resources and rem oves jobs from  the m arket place. It is easily m anipulated by foreign entities and an
uncontrolled data pool leaves plenty of room  for poisonin of the outcom es. Many AI corporations also gave ties to foreign enem ies and
sell out data, which m akes us m ore vulnerable to cyber-terrorism . I do not consent on an action plan that helps only our enem ies.
