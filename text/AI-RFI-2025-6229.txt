General Comment
I refuse to condone this proposal. 
-I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
-AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
-AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public
There is no rational just world where the future of our country will be secured by giving these AI leaches free rein to plunder our work
without oversight. If this governm ent continues to sell itself into the hands of corporations who care for nothing but their own profits, then I
will take solace as an Am erican who stood against it.
