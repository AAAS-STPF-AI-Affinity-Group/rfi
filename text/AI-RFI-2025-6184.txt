General Comment
Generative AI com panies and m odels are based inherently on the theft of creative property and no nation that claim s to have a functioning
legal system  would condone carte blanche scraping of the entirety of the internet and all content therein to m ake a product. This
technology is incapable of operating without direct input of labor and productive output from  m illions of people who are not being
com pensated for such, and it should be banned from  use outside of datasets with proper licensing.
