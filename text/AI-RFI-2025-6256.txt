General Comment
We should not allow unaccountable com panies steal from  creators. Com panies that want to train their AI program s should com pensate
those whose data they use. They should allow creators to opt out of such use. 
Stop allowing com panies to force us to give them  all of our work, when we spent years honing our crafts, and a lot of m oney to get
trained and educated to produce. Technology like this is soulless and forcing hard-working Am ericans out of jobs. 
We own the product of our labors. Letting AI com panies run roughshod over our rights and copyrights, with no legal recourse or
com pensation, is just theft.
