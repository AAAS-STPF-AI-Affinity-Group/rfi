Set up social safety nets to protect all citizens by equally distributing the value provided by AI to 
everyone. What is the point of accelerating AI development if the vast majority of citizens will 
not be able to reap the benefits? In simpler terms, AI wi ll lead to a massive loss of jobs, and 
ideally free up a lot of time to pursue interests that are not rooted in economic interest. This is 
not necessarily a bad thing, as long as there are social programs in place to provide for those 
whose who have been d isplaced. As it currently stands, the only people that stand to benefit are 
CEOs/billionaires simply because America's strategy to ensure continued contributions to society 
at scale is to direct provision of basic necessities to corporations (retirement fu nds, healthcare, 
ability to pay rent/mortgages, etc). AI replaces workers. CEOs still profit from the work being 
done, without having to pay for said work. What happens to the workers? We have an 
unbelievable opportunity to permanently bridge the wealth ga p by decoupling human labor from 
technical knowledge, or permanently widen the chasm with no hope of building a bridge. 
America has always been founded upon the principle that anybody should be able to make a 
name for themselves, but if you take away the o pportunities for people to rely on their skillsets 
and knowledge, then a vast majority of citizens will be ruined because everything in America 
costs money, and that money has historically come from working a job. You can soften this blow 
by categorizing t he domain knowledge/roles/jobs that will never be replaced by AI, and 
rewarding those who excel at them to redistribute workforce specialization. I hope the federal 
government stands by its commitment to the populace to better us all by setting up an appro priate 
stage when AI is ready to be a drop -in replacement for the majority of jobs.
