General Comment
AI has no place in the future of the US. It openly steals the work of hard working Am ericans and steps on their lively hoods. Allowing
these com pany's to openly take what's not there's is like falling for the biggest grift im aginable. They take and give nothing back in return,
it's a fleeting industry and giving them  full im m unity to the law is insanity.
