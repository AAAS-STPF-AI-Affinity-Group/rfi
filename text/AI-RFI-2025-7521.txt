General Comment
I do not condone OpenAI or its use. I am  vehem ently against OpenAI. AI is dangerous. Allowing OpenAI to have unfettered access to
stealing (yes, STEALING) data to then “train” their m odel USING THE STOLEN DATA is a danger to the safety of individuals, the
public, the econom y, the governm ent, and the world. Allowing OpenAI to do as they please would result in the destruction of creativity,
critical thinking, privacy, originality, and so m uch m ore.
OpenAI will destroy the lives of m ore people than it will help.
Do not allow OpenAI to have any access or rights. It should not be allowed to run ram pant with everyone’s inform ation.
