General Comment
AI is detrim ental to artists, to consum ers, to the spirit of hum an creativity and innovation itself and it is critical that it be strictly regulated,
and scrutinized through the lens of ethics FAR m ore closely than it has been. It m akes absolutely no sense to m ake AI an exception to
copyright law, there is no m oral reason to do this. If precident is not set to protect hum an artists and to keep AI beholden to intellectual
property law, the detrim ental effect on society at all levels will be huge.
