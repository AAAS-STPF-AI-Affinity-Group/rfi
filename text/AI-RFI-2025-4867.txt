General Comment
I believe free and unrestricted use of AI is harm ful. AI had a place to help in niche fields, such as agriculture and construction, but letting
com panies. However the private sector only wants to hey private inform ation of the people and steal their livelihood. Please consider the
thoughts of the people before trying to do this
