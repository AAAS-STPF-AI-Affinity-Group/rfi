General Comment
To put it sim ply: What is currently called AI is only an algorithm  that takes m assive am ounts of com puting power and wastes too m uch
electricity. AI, especially when it com es to im age generation, can and should be considered copyright infringem ent on all whose works
went into the m odel for these AI algorithm s. It is m y opinion that im age and anim ation based AI be controlled by copyright at the least and
rem oved if at all possible.
As for text-based AI, I believe there is som e use to it, however, it should be m ore specific than an end-all-be-all chat bot like Chat GPT
tries to be. Uses like checking coding or sum m arizing large texts is valuable. However, proper creative writing easily escapes AI far too
often and t takes m ore than an algorithm  to create proper narrative, and so creative writing AI should be treated the sam e as im age AI:
controlled by copyright or rem oved.
