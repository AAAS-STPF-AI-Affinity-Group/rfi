General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to com pletely bypass copyright laws steals from  everyone who's ever worked hard for their m oney. How are
honest Am ericans who wish to better everyone's lives expected to continue that if these com panies can take their hard work and reap in
all of the rewards without a single cent going to the people who m ade them ? This is bad for the Am erican econom y at large- people won't
be able to earn m oney on their products, future generations will have no say on what happens to their work- everyone loses. For the love
of God, do not turn your back on the people for the sake of m aking one com pany rich, especially since it's in a bubble waiting to pop any
year now! We can't sustain an entire country on fads and novelties!
