General Comment
AI does not have a place in the growth of Am erica. It steals data from  those who have com piled or created it them selves, and regurgitates
it in a horribly put together m anner.
When it com es to m edia, AI actively harm s and steals from  individuals who have put tim e, m oney, resources, and skills into the things that
they have m arketed and created, therefore risking pulling thousands of jobs from  the people.
AI also poses huge safety concerns, both by the security of the data collected and the well being of the people using it. If you poke around
on Google AI sum m aries enough, you'll find that it will m ake suggestions that could be potentially life threatening.
AI is a fleeting ideal that has no place in the grander schem e of Am erica. It will only lead to m aking things worse.
