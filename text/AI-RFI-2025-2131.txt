General Comment
I do not believe that unregulated AI will do any good for the Am erican people. My livelihood, as well as m illions of others, has been under
direct threat by LLMs and their ilk. I can vouch for the use of general AI in every day spaces, but the creative realm  m ust not be m ade
into data that feeds a giant copy m achine. We m ust invest in innovative and original ideas, now m ore than ever.
