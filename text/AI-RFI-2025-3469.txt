General Comment
Unspeakable evil. AI has NEVER been profitable for any com pany that used it. It will only serve to consum e m assive am ounts of electric
power, steal copyrighted m aterial illegally and generally upset Am erican people. AI m odels have been drastic failures in every use case.
EVERY SINGLE ONE. You have the data. Do som e god dam n research before you im plem ent this useless technology anywhere. How
dare you even consider this.
