Hello, 
If AI developers want to use copyright material, they must pay for the rights.
It's absolutely insane to think they'd get some special exception.AI has no place in our government and no place in our future. It's sole purpose is to deskill
craftspeople and steal the arts from the people.
 
Please. 
Thank you,  
Kristin Ridgley
