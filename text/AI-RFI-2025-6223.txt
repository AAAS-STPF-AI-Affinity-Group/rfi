General Comment
This will essentially legalize theft and m ake copyright a thing of the past. Not only does this steal from  actual people's hard work to
produce a m uch worse im itation, but it is far from  being 'intelligent', and relies on what is already out there in order to produce its m uch
worse, often incorrect and som etim es dangerously so product. AI is a grift and AI com panies only contribute to the enshittification of the
internet, m aking it less reliable and usable day by day. This plan should not be put into place.
