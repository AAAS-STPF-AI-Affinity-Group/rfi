General Comment
i am  part of a few large com unitys of ppl who do artwork for side m oney, for fun, or to m ake a living. this includs writing drawing painting
and m ore. there in noone that i know who wants their works stolen by a soules em otionles unim aginative com puter to create a m im icry of
art. noone in any art com unity whos worth getting a com ission from  would ever want their work taken by AI, even if they where payed for
it.
