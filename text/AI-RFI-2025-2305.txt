General Comment
AI has no place in the future of the US, and should not be allowed special treatm ent when it com es to bypassing copyright. The previous
executive order was im portant to ensure that com panies can't take the work of regular citizens without paym ent and use them  for
com m ercial gain. The rem oval of Biden's order 14110 is an extrem ely hostile action towards artists in particular, whose jobs are
threatened by large com panies seeking to use AI as a free replacem ent for their work. I would argue m ore regulations on AI are
necessary, rather than fewer, as com panies are already getting away with unethically sourcing data without consent for such projects. This
attem pt will only m ake such action m ore aggressive.
