General Comment
Allowing OpenAI to train its m odels on copyrighted work will directly harm  Am erican artists, developers, and creatives. Under the guise
that it is a m atter of "national security," this action will harm  the citizens it is claim ing to protect by stealing their work, which is a direct
threat to their livelihoods.
Hum ans are intelligent and digest art, literature, and knowledge from  others and then use that to form  their own ideas and work. However,
we as hum ans discourage plagiarism  and direct copying without perm ission or attribution, and as such should do the sam e with generative
AI m odels, whose existence is contingent on stealing from  that which already exists.
