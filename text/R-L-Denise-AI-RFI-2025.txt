I would really advocate more for AI if it didn't steal peoples copyrighted works, or anyone's art work in general!
Artificial Intelligence isn't a living organism, and so it doesn't have the ability to learn in the same manner humansdo, no matter how much they are designed to echo that. It's not just artists, but other people with creative skills thatcan lose their jobs or living if AI were to take advantage of all of its abilities wholeheartedly. Please look for anotherway for AI to learn Art forms without directly stealing multiple people's ideas.
