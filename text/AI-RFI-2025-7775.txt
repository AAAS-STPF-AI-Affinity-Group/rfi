General Comment
The rem oval of guardrails for generative AI will devastate m any industries and in the long term  lim it hum an art and culture. It will do the
exact opposite of prom ote hum an flourishing and will incentivize huge com panies to lay off workers in favor of AI m odels. Although these
m odels m ay be able to output serviceable work at a low price, they ultim ately cannot innovate beyond what they are fed on and can never
achieve the full potential that hum an skill can. Overreliance on AI will not only hurt industries in the long run but also result in a culture of
m ediocrity where the cheapest option is chosen every single tim e.
