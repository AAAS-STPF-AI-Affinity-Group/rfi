General Comment
"GenAI" is not actually "artifical intelligence" but a prom pt/answer program  that wastes resources and can't even supply correct answers
when asked questions. People will use this com puterized Mad Lib and profit off it, not to m ention the creators of such dubious system s,
but where is the com pensation for the people whose work and inform ation has been stolen in order to do this?. I vehem ently reject this
and do not consent to these people using m y inform ation/data/creation in such a way, and I do not wish the governm ent to cosign on
som ething that violates people's rights and properties as such.
