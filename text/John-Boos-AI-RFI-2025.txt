To Whom It May Concern:
My name is John Boos. I am the Founder/ CEO of HendrenAI. We are a B2B SaaS
platform that supports health systems, managed care organizations andpharmaceutical companies with AI/ ML technology.
 HendrenAI is  an AI-driven
healthcare technology company committed to advancing America’s leadership inartificial intelligence. As the U.S. government continues to shape policies that willdetermine the trajectory of AI innovation, we want to share our perspective on thecritical policy actions needed to sustain and enhance America’s AI competitiveness—particularly in healthcare, where AI is poised to drive transformative improvementsin
 patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and cost containment.
Maintaining U.S. AI Leadership in Healthcare
The U.S. has long been a global leader in AI research and commercialization, but as
international competition intensifies, it is imperative that our regulatory environmentsupports innovation rather than stifling it.
 Healthcare AI is at a pivotal moment—it has
the potential to revolutionize drug pricing, market access modeling, caremanagement, and health system operations, yet regulatory uncertainty andoverburdensome compliance requirements risk slowing progress.
Priority Policy Actions for Sustained AI CompetitivenessTo ensure that the U.S. remains at the forefront of AI-driven healthcare innovation, we
urge consideration of the following:
1.Balanced AI Regulation
 – While patient safety and data privacy are paramount,
AI regulations should be  risk-based and outcome-driven  rather than
imposing  one-size-fits-all compliance burdens. Overly complex approval
processes could push AI innovation offshore, leaving the U.S. behind.
2.Encouraging Public-Private Collaboration  – The government should actively
engage  healthcare AI companies like HendrenAI  to develop policies that foster
responsible innovation without excessive barriers. Sandboxes and pilot
programs can help  accelerate AI deployment while maintaining oversight.
3.Supporting AI Infrastructure & Talent Development  – Sustained investment
in computing infrastructure, AI workforce training, and research partnerships  will
be essential to maintaining a competitive edge against China and the EU.
Streamlining AI Reimbursement Pathways  – The U.S. must modernize


4. 
reimbursement frameworks to  incentivize AI adoption in healthcare, ensuring
that Medicare, Medicaid, and private payers  recognize the value AI brings to
efficiency and patient care.
5.Preventing Regulatory Overreach that Stifles Innovation  – While ethical AI use
is critical, policies must be designed to  enable rapid iteration, testing, and
deployment  in healthcare without excessive red tape that delays real-world
impact.
HendrenAI is actively working with  payers, PBMs, health systems, and
pharmaceutical stakeholders  to deploy AI solutions that reduce costs, improve
access, and enhance patient outcomes. We believe that with  strategic policy support,
the U.S. can continue leading the world in AI-driven healthcare transformation.
We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues further and contribute to shaping
policies that keep the U.S. at the forefront of AI innovation. Please let us know aconvenient time for a discussion.
 
Sincerely,
John Boos, PharmD, MBA
