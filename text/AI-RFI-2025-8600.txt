General Comment
Governm ent should NOT be involved in Generative AI. It necessitates the stripping of Am erican education, intelligence, and creativity
and, based on the absolute vitriol with which the forcible shoving of AI into industry has been m et, it is not a boon to our econom y.MO
ONE WANTS THIS. And no one wants to spend our tax dollars to allow billionaires to rape our work and keep the profits. 
There is NO path forward in which governm ent facilitation of AI developm ent is useful, profitable, or helpful for Am ericans.
