General Comment
Giving a pardon of copyright to AI, like OpenAI, is going to break a lot of things!
Econom ically, it’s non profitable and, in fact, burns m oney and resources just to work. Even for personal training use, it will be high
m aintenance with only an idea that could be changed later. Creatively, it will allow so m any people’s copyright, big com panies included, to
be stolen and stripped of m eaning. People are proud and grateful that they get to share their work and the use of it in AI is going to m ake
sure they aren’t heard or paid when their art is being used by som eone else.
It is far too harm ful to all our futures and shouldn’t be given an excuse to steal!
