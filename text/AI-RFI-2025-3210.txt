General Comment
The gross m isuse of generative AI needs to stop. Millions of resources are being stolen, official or fanwork. Copyright violations also are
at risk of this being passed. The m isinform ation in using generated content has harm ed the political clim ate drastically in the past 3 years.
More regulations should be m ade to m inim ize dam age, not letting AI be above lawsuits
