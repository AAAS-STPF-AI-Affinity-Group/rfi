General Comment
I highly disapprove of any plans to bolster AI because it m eans that Am ericans' private data will be stolen and sold to com panies training
m achines that have been proven to be detrim ental to both the livelihood of Am erican citizens and the environm ent. I do not believe AI
holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood and profits off of theft. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the
Am erican public. No Am erican citizen truly wants AI in their lives. There are no benefits to AI; it is useless and detrim ental. As an
Am erican citizen it is m y duty to dem and that any federal order seeking to bolster AI is shut down.
