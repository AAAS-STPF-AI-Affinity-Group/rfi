General Comment
"Artificial Intelligence" is only a half truth - it is artificial, yes, but not intelligent. And it has abso lutely NO p lace within reach of act ual ART. 
*EVERY* single dataset for AI has been based upon S TOLEN work. And now it's be ing proposed to o ffer Ope nAI complete legal
immunity from cop yright law? After which EVERY OTHER AI thief will gleefully seize upon their own ransacking and cannibalism of t he
work of cou ntless others, who will see NO prof it, NO acknow ledgment, and NO recourse for such an abom inable decision .
To quote my late, great, ever-awesome Nana, a New Yorker throu gh and throu gh: "F&^% you and the horse you rode in."
AI holds NO p lace in any artistic forum, venue, or methodology. It is THEFT. And while thievery is currently 'en vogue' in our current 
administration by t he robber baro ns masquerading as government officials, SOM EONE has to draw a line.
Draw the godsda mned line HERE.
