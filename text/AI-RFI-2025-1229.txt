General Comment
It is this citizen’s opinion that AI is a frivolous technology that provides no m aterial benefit to the Am erican people. The rem oval of
“Unnecessary burdensom e requirem ents” am ounts to wholesale gutting of copyright protections for the sole benefit of a m assive
corporation that seeks only to gain m ore profit at the expense of all. Em powering these AI m odels will result in unprecedented
m isinform ation cam paigns and catastrophic decay in foundational skills of students for generations to com e. I wholeheartedly rebuke this
push to grant special privileges to a corporation.
