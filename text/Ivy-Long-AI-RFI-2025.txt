To whom it may concern, 
I am writing to express a stance firmly against the AI Action Plan outlined on Document Number 2025-02305. 
As a creative, artificial intelligence does not benefit myself, my peers, or the general public you represent as a
government agency. AI has directly profited off the work of my peers in a way that the federal government wouldnot allow for any other body or work or patent. It's only utility is absorbing and regurgitating visual/written inputwith no value to the consumer, the worker, or our society at large. Promoting AI in anyway is anti-American and adirect insult to the American dream. 
Please do not remove the protection hard-working creators have against our livelihoods being taken
away. 
Sincerely, 
Ivy Long
