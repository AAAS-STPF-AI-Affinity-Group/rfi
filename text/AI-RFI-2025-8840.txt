General Comment
AI developers should be held to the sam e standard as private citizens or academ ics. You need to pay to use copyrighted m aterial in your
work. Be if for research in a fan-fiction art piece, or a research paper, copyright needs to be protected. We have m eans to bypass
copyright which is called "fair use". Fair use is determ ined by the courts who's job it is to interpenetrate laws and the Constitution. Not by
the executive to m ake there own carve outs those they want to.
