Good evening, I am an artist, and content creator, and I urge our countries leaders to take a
stand against this plan. AI Training having access to copyrighted materials puts everydayAmerican citizens, such as myself, at risk of losing future work. And with the aggressivedevelopment of Generative AI, we have already begun to see a overwhelming impact on thecreative working class of the United States. Generative AI can, will, and already has put astrain on our economy. With its overwhelming power supply demand, and job loss, whichcauses less tax paying workers from helping fuel our economy. In both my community and myhome I have witnessed the impacts that uncontrolled Atrifical Intelligence training can have,in both income loss, and in well being due to that loss. I ask that you take real consideration toboth the short term, and long term consequences of unrestricted Artificial Intelligence trainingwill have on the American people. Thank you for your time.
