General Comment
Allowing AI to be trained on any sort of work that isnâ€™t first paid for or generated by the com pany crafting the AI would be disastrous for
creators and creatives everywhere. People deserve to be com pensated for their art, and the labor put into developing a style. Giving this
to incom petent tech billionaires just so they can create a hideous sim ulacrum  of hum an creativity is unconscionable.
