General Comment
It is im portant that AI technology, both its training and use, does not infringe upon the copyright of any individual or com pany. Individuals
and com panies need strong protections to prevent the m edia they create from  becom ing part of AI m odels without their consent or
authorization, and there needs to be a legal pathway to punish AI operators who break this protection. Without this protection, what
reason do any of us have to continue creating anything? Anything we create would just be stolen and regurgitated by AI m odels. Rather
than rem ove "unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents," we need m uch stronger ones so that we can all choose whether to participate in
this new technological frontier or not.
