General Comment
AI should be beholden to our copyright laws else it will be used as a loophole for infringem ent. Allowing AI to circum vent such
protections would destroy all creative fields within the US as, even now, creatives are being laid off in favor of AI generated alternatives
despite their poor reception. Allowing this to pass would kill creative careers. Why would creative talent work in the US if som eone is just
going to steal their content, rem ix it instantly, and sell it for profit? Why spend years honing a craft for som eone to type a prom pt and
m ake a quick buck? 
I hope you'll reconsider how terrible this would be for creatives, the econom y, and the environm ent.
