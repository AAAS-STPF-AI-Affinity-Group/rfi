General Comment
LLMs are a fad. They are not useful to consum ers, and any attem pts to shoehorn them  into workflows results in m ore errors and less
accountability for those errors.
However, in an attem pt to further develop these m odels (thus allowing for the creation of hype-building press releases), m any AI
com panies have dem anded the ability to scrape data from  the entire Internet, with com plete disregard for any form  of licensing or
copyright law. AI training bots already blatantly ignore robots.txt (a m anner to tag content as being inaccessible to bots), and giving them
an exem ption from  copyright will destroy the Am erican intellectual property system . 
Additionally, it is physically im possible to scale LLM m odels in a way that will m ake them  profitable -- they require too m uch data, too
m uch power, and too m uch hardware. OpenAI is bleeding m oney. Anthropic is bleeding m oney. These com panies are going to collapse
under their own weight, and if the governm ent puts too m uch m oney and political power into keeping them  afloat, it will be dragged down
with them .
In 20 years, do we want to be known as the nation that let an unsustainable business m odel collapse in on itself? Or do we want to be
known as the country that destroyed its copyright system  chasing a technology fad?
