General Comment
Hello there, 
I'm  a firm  believer that AI holds no singular place in the future of the United States. It should not be used in anything which replaces the
hum an creativity process or within alm ost all services that hum ans perform . AI steals from  those I deeply appreciate within the art scene
and steals from  their livelihood. These are not sim ple opinions or observations, it is a hard fact which these m achines rely on to create their
own rubbish 'art'. AI is also both overhyped with its usage and is overall fleecing in the eyes of m any within the Am erican public. This is a
terrible m ove to use even m ore AI.
