General Comment
As an American who grew up in the 90s, I' ve grown up surrounded by tec hnology, and have grown up alongside the growth of co mputers 
and all the incredible things they can do. To me, it is a wondrous thing to see a ll that tec hnology has beco me capab le of do ing. However, 
for all the good t hat tec hnology is able to do, it cannot be underest imated t he ill that it is, per haps, e ven more capab le of. And it is on t hat 
latter capac ity that I re mark upon r ight now.
Generative AI is a fun toy to p lay aro und with. I can understa nd why so many see it as a co mpelling are to p lay aro und with. However, it 
cannot be ignored t hat most generative AI models are b uilt upon re gurgitation. They absorb incredible amounts of data from ot her sources 
and then smush it together. They are, inherently, unable to create new ideas, a nd everything of value they prod uce is taken from human 
beings whose work they have absorbed. This is not a model t hat we, as Americans, should want to see s ucceed. And certa inly it is not 
something that we should *incentivize* by giving these mammoth co mpanies free re ign to violate the rights of ot her peop le to the proceeds  
of their works by using these often misunderstood AI models as an excuse. Exem ptions for Copyri ght in this realm is an absol ute 
mistake.  Whether the infringem ent is intentional by individuals within those compan ies, or obf uscated throu gh layers of AI &^%, 
they shou ld be subject to all of the laws we already have on the books.
