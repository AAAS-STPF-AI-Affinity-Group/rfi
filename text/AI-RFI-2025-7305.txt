General Comment
While I believe that the developm ent of AI could result in som e econom ically im portant application, I believe it is particularly im portant to
respect copyright law and ensure that copyrighted m aterial is used with perm ission and com pensation. If AI is truly going to be that
econom ically revolutionary, the developers of AI should easily be able to appropriately com pensate the people whose work m ade that AI
possible.
