General Comment
Ai cannot generate any content without scrapping existing content. It cannot process falsehoods from  truths. The proliferation of the use of
AI will only serve to hurt the average Am erican citizen as the select few who already have m ore m oney than sense, regurgitate the stolen
efforts of those they deem ed unworthy of protection, back and forth between them selves forever. Each wave of which will further distort
Truth into nonsense. Further erode the artistic endeavors of hum ankind into unrecognizable slop of pixels of no value. 
All at the significant cost of precious resources we need to live as a species. Stop boiling our water, stop burning the plants we need to
breath, just away to power a pathetic tangle of code som eone has convinced you is all powerful. This "AI" as it is presented to us is a
m ockery, a sham , for those with all the power in the world to further force the gap between them selves and the com m on m an.
Do not support the expansion of AI, if anything support the expansion of detecting the use of AI, it's falsehoods, and the protection of
Am erican citizens.
