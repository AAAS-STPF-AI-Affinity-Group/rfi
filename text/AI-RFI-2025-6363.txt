General Comment
To those it concerns,
I am  a US citizen and a 33 year old professional writer. Frankly, I am  appalled that this is even a discussion we are having, and yet here I
am  taking the tim e out of m y day to write a com m ent to voice m y strong opposition to any grace given to OpenAI. I am  firm ly and fully
against OpenAI having im m unity, protection, or any sort of special treatm ent regarding copyright violation. Their current activities am ount
to theft of intellectual properties owned by real artists, writers, and other IPs. If the governm ent em powers OpenAI to steal further data
with this proposed resolution and action by Sam  Alton and his com pany; then there will be no protection for -any- works of art, written or
otherwise.
Like other defining periods throughout our history, this too stands as a pivotal m om ent where we as a society need to take a firm  and
defiant stance and tell these big AI com panies no m ore. No m ore theft. Copyrights m atter. They cannot and should not be allowed to steal
content en m asse or at all. 
It is m y hope that whom ever reads this finds this com m ent and takes it to heart; that it be known that I, as a US tax paying, law abiding
citizen, am  firm ly and fully opposed to OpenAI and their continued banditry of the internet com e to a com plete and total end. Regulate
them  and stop it.
Thank you for your tim e,
Kris Roldan
