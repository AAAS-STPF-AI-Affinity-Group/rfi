Executive Order 14179 of January 23, 2025, "Removing Barriers to
American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence", reads as if it were
written by the owner of an AI company that is all too aware that the
bubble is about to burst, and the scam about to end, in much the same
way that the "Bored Ape Yacht Club" NFT scam recently collapsed.
And, to be fair, this concern is well-warranted. The development of
the high-parameter large language models has succeeded only in
producing streams of data that are statistically likely to sound like
plausible information, and as such are only slightly more useful than
a Donald Trump campaign speech. The output they generate is
essentially what a smart person sounds like to a stupid person. Their
value is therefore a tiny fraction of their cost, which is why AI
companies are lobbying the White House for what is essentially a
bailout.
For years, conservative politicians have assured us that the
government should not be in the business of picking winners and
losers, and even if reasonable people can disagree on this, we should
not be picking this particular loser.
