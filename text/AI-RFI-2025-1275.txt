General Comment
Nobody is buying the AI &^%. Nobody wants to see their labor, their copyri ghts, their IPs taken and exploited by hacks who 
don't want to pay the creati ve labor force. The only ones who want th is are those try ing desperately to recoup their millions of 
gam bled money just like nfts. 
If your businesses ca n't grow without exploitative, rampant disregard of trade laws it deser ves to lose money and shutdown.
And I have no faith in the current pres ident with a lifetime record of failed businesses a nd a rep utation of st iffing his employers and 
contractors be ing an ob vious puppet lackey to t he civilian billionaire who bought his way into the white house. That speaks volumes abo ut 
their character a nd businesnuts.
