RE: SHRM Response to Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan   
Dear  Acting Director Kratsios and Acting Director Dohne: 
On behalf of SHRM, thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts with The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on the Trump Administration’s Request for 
Information (RFI) regarding the development of a national Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-proprietary or confidential information. Document contents may be reused by the government in developing the AI Action Plan and associated documents without attribution. 
As the voice of all things work, workers, and the workplace, SHRM is the foremost expert, 
convener, and thought leader on issues impacting today’s evolving workplaces. With over 340,000 members in 180 countries, SHRM impacts the lives of more than 362 million workers and families globally.  
SHRM strongly believes that AI presents incredible opportunities for organizations to transform 
how work is done. SHRM recognizes that AI has the potential to significantly enhance workplace productivity, drive innovation, and contribute to the future of work, and welcomes the opportunity to provide input on priority policy actions for inclusion in the Administration's AI Action Plan.  
SHRM’s Stance on AI in the Workplace  
As SHRM President and CEO Johnny C. Taylor, Jr. has stated, “The opportunities AI presents 
are limitless. When combined with human ingenuity (HI), this synergy has the capacity to 
transform your organization while maximizing human potential. AI + HI = ROI.” SHRM’s philosophy is that AI should be viewed as a powerful tool that, when coupled with human 
intelligence, drives innovation, and maximizes results for organizations. Our approach supports the Administration's goal of maintaining America's position as "the leader in AI" through policies that ensure that AI will make our workers more productive. 
In our research, we found that 88% of HR leaders agree that AI should complement human 
capabilities rather than replace workers . The notion of human intelligence (HI) combined 
with AI is essential to the future of work. For example, 83% of HR leaders anticipate upskilling will be essential for workers to remain competitive in an AI -driven job market . 


This is particularly crucial as AI tools automate routine tasks, but human creativity, judgment, 
and emotional intelligence remain indispensable. 
SHRM's research further demonstrates that when AI and human ingenuity combine, they create 
transformative opportunities in the workplace. This supports the Administration's view that AI's success "isn't just a matter of smart people sitting in front of a c omputer screen" but depends on 
workers across all sectors becoming more productive through AI adoption.  
Building America’s AI -Ready Workforce Requires Investments in Upskilling and 
Reskilling  
SHRM supports the Administration's commitment to ensuring "America has the best- trained 
workforce in the world" where workers are well -prepared to "manage, supervise, and interact 
with AI -enabled tools," as Vice President Vance highlighted in his speech at the Artificial 
Intelligence Action Summit in Paris. SHRM strongly supports the Administration's worker- first 
approach to AI development, and believes that to maintain global leadership in AI, workforce 
preparedness must be a cornerstone of America's national AI strategy. 
SHRM supports the Administration's vision that AI will "make our workers more productive" 
rather than replace them. As Vice President Vance emphasized, "AI, we believe, is going to make us more productive, more prosperous, and more free."  
SHRM's research confirms that AI -driven workplace transformations will impact approximately 
19 million jobs  across various sectors —not through displacement, but by fundamentally 
enhancing how work is performed and creating new opportunities for American workers. 
SHRM’s research also shows that the AI skills gap is a  pressing issue that requires attention.  
SHRM’s 2024 AI in the Workplace research shows that 83% of HR leaders see upskilling as vital  in an AI-driven economy, and 76% of U.S. workers recognize the need for new skills .

This same research also shows that while AI holds tremendous potential to advance American 
leadership in global innovation, 43% of HR leaders have limited or no theoretical knowledge of AI , and 62% lack practical experience.  
As of  2024, only 50% of companies reported offering upskilling and reskilling opportunities  
for employees because of AI.  This skills gap represents a strategic challenge that must be 
addressed to fulfill the Administration's vision of maintaining America's position as "the leader 
in AI." To address these challenges  and align with the Administration's commitment to ensuring 
"America has the best -trained workforce in the world" SHRM recommends that the Action Plan 
include robust public- private partnerships with businesses and educational institutions to develop 
practical AI skills training programs that directly address the needs of workers and the workplace.  
As workplaces adopt AI, SHRM believes policies must balance innovation with workforce 
stability and  ensure access to upskilling and reskilling opportunities for all workers, particularly 
those most impacted by technological change, will help strike this balance. SHRM believes that 
partnerships focusing on upskilling and reskilling of American workers must first invest in and

emphasize fundamental AI literacy programs  that help workers adapt and thrive in an AI-
enhanced workplace.  
SHRM also believes that partnerships focusing on personalized learning approaches will be 
crucial to equip workers with the specific skills needed to unlock AI's full potential in their respective roles and industries, and that federal government efforts will be well -served through 
encouraging collaboration across multiple sectors, with businesses, educational institutions, and professional organizations like SHRM each contributing their unique expertise to help workers adapt, thrive, and drive long- term economic growth. 
To address potential workforce transitions driven by AI adoption, SHRM also supports federal policies that strengthen and expand the education- to-employment pipeline and skills-based hiring 
practices. These approaches are critical for ensuring that job can didates develop in-demand 
skills —many of which are increasingly AI- related —and that employers focus on capabilities 
rather than traditional credentials. SHRM recommends that the AI Action Plan includes 
provisions to support credential transparency, skills-based hiring frameworks, and closer collaboration between educational institutions and employers to ensure curriculum alignment with evolving workforce needs. 
Regulatory Clarity Supports AI Innovation and Workplace Excellence SHRM supports a balanced approach to AI regulation that prioritizes innovation while ensuring 
responsible deployment in the workplace. As Vice President Vance emphasized, excessive regulation "could kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off." SHRM believes that a fragmented regulatory landscape with inconsistent state and local AI regulations creates barriers to adoption and innovation., and potentially imposes significant compliance burdens on employers, particularly those operating across mul tiple jurisdictions, potentially threatening 
America's competitive edge in AI development and adoption. To address this concern, SHRM supports a uniform federal standard that provides clarity to employers regarding the steps they should take to prevent bias and to guide responsible AI use. 
SHRM believes that clear standards and guidelines are needed to build trust between employers 
and employees, facilitating a worker-first AI strategy. Clear standards can ensure accountability and prevent unintended bias in HR processes that use AI, allowing organizations to confidently implement these technologies. When workers trust that AI systems are fair and transparent, they more readily embrace these tools as partners in their professional development rather than viewing them as threats to their livelihoods. 
HR professionals are already leveraging AI to meet modern workplace demands, enhancing 
capabilities and addressing complex challenges. From streamlining recruitment processes to personalizing learning and development opportunities, AI is transforming how H R departments 
operate and deliver value to their organizations. This transformation allows HR professionals to focus on strategic initiatives that directly impact organizational success and employee well-being. 


Maintaining leadership in AI means ensuring American workers and businesses have the clarity 
and confidence to adopt these technologies. It means fostering an environment where innovation can flourish while establishing guardrails that prevent harm. By str iking a balance between risks 
and opportunities, and providing certainty and clarity to employers and HR professionals using or seeking to use AI , SHRM believes the administration can advance a worker -first approach that 
both strengthens America's competit ive position in the global AI marketplace and creates more 
productive, fulfilling workplaces where employees can thrive alongside AI-enhanced systems. 
Privacy and Cybersecurity Framework for Responsible AI  
SHRM recognizes that privacy and cybersecurity considerations are foundational to responsible 
AI adoption in the workplace. According to SHRM's research, 41% of HR leaders report increased concern over cyberattacks  due to AI integration in their organizations. As the 
holders of sensitive employee data, HR departments are particularly mindful of cybersecurity threats, making strong privacy and security frameworks essential components of any national AI strategy.  
This clarity and confidence are necessary to accelerate AI adoption in workplaces across America, ensuring that HR departments can fully realize AI's productivity-enhancing potential without compromising data security. Organizations that feel secure in their ability to implement AI tech nologies responsibly are more likely to invest in these tools and the associated training 
programs, advancing the Administration's goals of maintaining American leadership in AI innovation while creating more productive, competitive workplaces. Furthermore, addressing these cybersecurity concerns directly supports the worker-first approach by demonstrating that employee data protection remains a priority even as AI transforms workplace processes.  
Conclusion 
SHRM appreciates OSTP's commitment to developing an AI Action Plan that fosters innovation 
while avoiding overregulation. SHRM is committed to working alongside the Administration to ensure that AI’s integration into the workplace promotes innovation, economic growth, and opportunity for all workers. Through collaboration and thoughtful policymaking, we can build a future of work where AI and human ingenuity coexist to create better workplaces and a stronger economy. 
We look forward to continuing the conversation and collaborating with policymakers to develop 
AI strategies that benefit all workers.
