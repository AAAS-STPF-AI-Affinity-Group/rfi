General Comment
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
* AI cannot replace hum an ingenuity and creativity.
* The people pushing AI the hardest are the people who want to m ake a profit off it at the expense of the am erican taxpayer.
* I will never support a politician who votes to expand AI usage ever again, nor will I give them  any m oney no m atter how hard the DNC
begs m e.
