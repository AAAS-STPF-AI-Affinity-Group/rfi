General Comment
Do we want to be a nation of individuals, or a nation of AI?
I work in the video gam e industry, and AI has only been detrim ental to m y colleagues and their livelihoods.
Once real artists art out AI will only have itself to train off of regurgitating garbage, this will only m ake the arts becom e stagnant. 
AI's im pact on the environm ent should not be overlooked. With the rising clim ate crisis, it is obscene som ething as frivolous as AI is taking
precedent. 
I am  against giving AI the right to train off m y work. They do not have m y perm ission.
