General Comment
AI creations are built on stolen m aterial and if they can't function without that they shouldn't exist. I'm  an artist, AI is solely m eant to m ake
m y life and the life of those like m e a lot harder. AI seeks to m ake us obsolete and prevent us from  m aking a living with skills we have
spent countless tim e honing and perfecting to find "our voice." AI has no voice, it's a sim ulation built on the voices of others.
