General Comment
I am  your average Am erican who creates various artworks and crafts, ans shares them  with the world. I have worked hard for years to
develop the skills and knowledge.
The AI system s m ade by Big Tech com panies like OpenAI (Microsoft) and Google threaten to destroy thousands of Am erican sm all
businesses with their recent dem and to be exem pt from  copyright law.
AI system s can only be produced by first training on work m ade by people. My personal work, and the work of hundreds of thousands
of other everyday Am erican creators and businesses was taken and fed into these AI system s without our consent or any com pensation.
They ingest our work, reassem ble it, and then sell it back to our clients – directly com peting with us and cutting us out of the m arketplace.
Now these Big Tech com panies are asking this adm inistration to create exceptions and loopholes to m ake this practice of stealing
Am erican creators’ copyrighted work legal precedent. They are suggesting that if a m achine ingests and reproduces copyrighted work, it
is som ehow suddenly “fair use”.
They seem  to believe that anything and everything on the internet – regardless of who owns it – should be theirs for the taking. They claim
that if this adm inistration does not allow them  to rewrite the law in this way, it will stifle Am erican innovation.
Instead, it will have the opposite effect. The purpose of Am erican copyright law is to protect the incentive to create and innovate.
If we the Am erican people do not own our creations, and everything we put online will be stolen by Big Tech giants, what will be the
incentive to create? If everyday Am ericans create a new innovative piece of com puter code, a new visual design, or a new piece of m usic
only to have it im m ediately stolen by Google and Microsoft, why bother creating it in the first place? How will we possibly m ake a living
doing these things? It would be sim pler to not share at all, which will im pact AI technology when it runs out of artwork to take from .
Protect Am erican creators. Do not create new copyright exem ptions that allow Big Tech com panies to exploit and steal from  creators and
everyday Am ericans without perm ission, com pensation, or transparency.
This adm inistration’s AI Action Plan should focus not on giving away creator content to Big Tech com panies, but rather on ensuring a fair
m arketplace with com petition:
First, the governm ent should ensure that creators and everyday Am ericans give effective consent, so that we can decide when and where
our work is used by AI system s.
Second, the AI Action Plan should encourage a robust licensing m arketplace, so that the incentive to create for sm all businesses is
preserved.
Finally, the AI Action Plan should require transparency from  Big Tech com panies, requiring them  to disclose what m aterial is in their
training datasets, and label what content is AI generated.


I am  not anti-technology. It consistently im presses m e the capabilities of these AI system s, and find them  incredibly useful for m any things.
But it should not be used if it sacrifices the everyday m an.
