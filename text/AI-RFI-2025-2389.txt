General Comment
If Am erica decides to prioritize the use of unlicensed work as training data for these big AI tech firm s, it risks losing the very thing that
m akes it unique and profitable. If working artists are unable to contribute m eaningfully and m ake a living, there will no longer be incentive
for the creation of one of Am erica's biggest exports: entertainm ent of all kinds (m usic, m ovies, video gam es, books, etc.). Generative AI is
largely proving to be unprofitable and far too expensive to m aintain at the rate these com panies want. In the end, everyone loses out if
com panies are able to skirt that law and destroy other industries and livelihoods in the process. These big businesses are racing to the
bottom  for a technology that is largely useless to m ost people. They put on flashy displays, but in the last three years generative AI hasn't
really revolutionized any business. If anything, it has m uddied things for m any people, often m aking things m ore com plicated than need be
by adding an autom ated elem ent that doesn't work well and frustrates m ore than helps. 
If Am erica wants to keep its com petitive edge, it needs to uphold copyright so that working people can m aintain their livelihoods and
continue to contribute to society. Don't allow these tech firm s to con the public with im possible prom ises while CEOs line their pockets
with the m oney that should have gone to working people.
