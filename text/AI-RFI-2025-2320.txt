General Comment
AI is a blight on inform ation, research, art, and ethics. It is a grift for the 1% to have access to skill without putting in the tim e and effort,
paying only a fraction of the cost to com panies who own the datasets, while not having to pay the hum an creators whose work was used
for training without their consent. Funding would be better spent actually going towards the arts, education, and scientific research as well
as paying artists, writers, and program m ers m ore for their work.
