General Comment
While I am  not vehem ently opposed to certain progress and achievem ents m ade by further developm ent of artificial intelligence, I im plore
lawm akers to put what's best for the people first. That is, protecting people's intellectual property, their right to privacy, and even their
own identities. Too m any tim es has certain generative A.I. projects been used in bad faith, whether to obtain the creative works of others
to train m odels without their consent, certain "deep fakes" m ade to im itate, im personate, or otherwise exploit a person of ANY status or
class for injust reasons, or to use these system s to m ake life m ore difficult for the com m on Am erican. While innovation is a wonderful
thing, and we should encourage it, safeguards m ust be put in place, not to deter progress, but to m ake sure progress stays on the right
track for the good of ALL people, not just for those of a certain status. This is a powerful tool, increasing with power day by day. We
need to m ake sure it is used ethically, lest it let those in bad faith to continue working in bad faith.
