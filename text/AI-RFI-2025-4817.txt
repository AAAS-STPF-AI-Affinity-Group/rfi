General Comment
Artificial Intelligence, especially generative AI, has no place in the future of Am erican business. It steals work from  Am erican people,
especially creatives, and attem pts to replace it with a soulless facsim ile that cheapens the im age of any person or business that uses it. If
Am erican businesses heavily use AI, other countries will see us as thieves with no m orals, and too poor to pay hum an artists to create
works for us.
