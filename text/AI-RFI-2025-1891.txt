Subject: Achieving Artificial Intelligence Governance
Hi there!
Achieving national-level Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance can be realized through three core governance m odels: optim izing resource
utilization in AI, m itigating risks associated with AI production and application, and increasing organizational benefits and profits. Below, I
have outlined key considerations necessary for achieving these goals:
Optim izing Resource Utilization in AI Activities To accelerate the prevention of resource wastage in policym aking and execution, the
following steps are vital:
While adherence to standards is beneficial, contradictions am ong them  m ust be resolved. Otherwise, they risk becom ing the prim ary
source of resource wastage within com panies and governm ent sectors.
Many references are created by universities that have not engaged with practical applications, rendering them  less effective in addressing
real-world challenges.
All AI-related efforts m ust align with project m anagem ent principles, ensuring tangible results—be it profit or goal realization—within
specified tim efram es and budgets. It is no longer viable to fund research ventures in the guise of corporate projects without accountability.
The principles and m ethods of software service production m ust be utilized when creating services.
Funding for repetitive tasks should be m inim ized. Often, while a project’s title and problem  statem ent m ay differ, execution m ethods rely
on existing approaches, m aking it unnecessary to allocate full budgets. Instead, partial funding for enhancem ents suffices.
Integrating AI Risk Managem ent for AI Governance Effective AI governance necessitates the alignm ent of AI with risk m anagem ent. A
specialized system  can be designed to leverage these three critical elem ents, adding national value instead of inadvertently contributing to
resource waste. I have developed such a system .
A form al authority for validating AI's inherent risks m ust be established, enabling organizations to utilize it without expending resources on
identifying repetitive issues.
AI risk m anagem ent term inology should be continually updated by a com m ittee com prising universities and com panies. Current leading
universities in the United States often fail to distinguish adequately between issues, risks, and incidents in AI, and instead use these term s
interchangeably, as observed in their m ost prom inent articles and projects.
In sum m ary, by im plem enting these m easures, organizations and nations can ensure that AI governance not only drives efficiency and risk
m itigation but also yields substantial and sustainable benefits.
Sincerely, 


Mohsen
