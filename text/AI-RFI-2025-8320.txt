General Comment
So, don't allow this to happen.
This gives precedent to allow com panies to not only obtain data for use in their AI, but also allow them  to obtain data from  other AI as
well.
Think about what practical use is there for AI for a typical consum er?
There is none, especially for an average consum er.
This pushes away any hum anity we have left in Am erica. All for com panies to save less than 1 percent in profits.
Besides, all the energy spent is taxing our weak energy supply to power and store these AI databases, m ainfram es, and server farm s.
So, in short, AI is bad in com m ercial use.
Scientific, m edical, and governm ent use would be better suited, for specific assistance related tasks.
DO NOT EVER USE IT AS A MAIN SOURCE SUCH AS REPLACING HUMAN ELEMENTS. Assisting hum an elem ents should
be the m ain goal.
