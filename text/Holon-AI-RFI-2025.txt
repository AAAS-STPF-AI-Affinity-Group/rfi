Fairfax, VA 22031  Public Comment on the Development of a Comprehensive AI Action Plan  
To the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Networking and Information 
Technology Research and Development National Coordination Office: 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments regarding the development of a 
comprehensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. 
As an attorney actively engaged in complex federal and state regulatory matters involving 
emerging technologies—including artificial intelligence, intellectual property, healthcare, and 
highly regulated markets—I provide these recommendations to shape a forward-looking, 
innovative, and practical national AI strategy: 
1. Holonic and Decentralized Governance: Practical Frameworks
Adopting a holonic governance structure—a decentralized system of autonomous yet 
interconnected units ("holons")—can enhance AI governance significantly. While this model is 
still emerging, it parallels successful governance structures used in sectors such as supply chain 
management and internet governance, which rely on decentralization balanced by clear federal 
standards. In practice, this means designing AI policies that allow government agencies, 
businesses, and communities to innovate independently within national guidelines, fostering 
agility and responsiveness without sacrificing cohesive national oversight. 
2. Balanced Regulatory Framework to Encourage Responsible InnovationClear yet flexible regulation is essential. Policymakers should encourage experimentation and 
innovation within well-defined ethical and security boundaries. Regulatory "sandboxes"—
controlled environments already used in AI development by countries such as Singapore—
should be expanded in the U.S. to allow innovators to experiment confidently without creating 
undue regulatory burdens. Such frameworks should explicitly clarify expectations regarding 
privacy, cybersecurity, and ethical practices, protecting the public while empowering innovation. 


3. Strengthening American AI Leadership and Global Competitiveness
The United States must maintain leadership in AI by actively fostering strategic partnerships that 
expand American innovation, market access, and geopolitical influence. Initiatives should 
emphasize collaboration between U.S. technology leaders and key international markets, 
particularly in strategic regions such as Africa and Asia. These partnerships will open new 
economic opportunities, secure essential supply chains, and reinforce America’s competitive 
edge. This approach aligns with existing national AI strategies, like the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), and ensures continued American economic resilience and national security. 
4. Resilient and Sustainable AI Infrastructure
Strategic investment in sustainable AI infrastructure is critical. This includes promoting 
renewable-powered data centers—already proven effective by companies such as Google, which 
leveraged AI to reduce data center cooling energy use by approximately 40%—alongside 
decentralized computing solutions and AI-integrated urban planning. Cities leveraging AI for 
traffic management, energy efficiency, and infrastructure maintenance demonstrate that such 
approaches are already practical, beneficial, and scalable. Integrating sustainability with 
infrastructure investment ensures future-proof growth in AI capabilities. 
5. AI and Effective, Responsive Government
AI presents substantial opportunities to improve government efficiency, responsiveness, and 
transparency. Real-world applications, including AI-driven chatbots for rapid citizen service responses (as successfully implemented in various U.S. states) and predictive analytics for 
efficient resource allocation, already illustrate AI's transformative potential in governance. 
Moreover, AI-powered transparency initiatives—such as algorithmic transparency standards and 
automated data analysis to detect anomalies in public spending—will significantly enhance 
public trust and accountability. Governmental AI should continue emphasizing explainability, 
transparency, and responsible data practices. 
6. Economic Empowerment and Inclusive Innovation
The AI Action Plan must ensure economic benefits extend to businesses of all sizes, particularly 
small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures. Supporting early-stage companies through 
targeted funding, simplified regulations, and public-private partnerships is crucial for broad-
based innovation. This approach will catalyze job creation, encourage entrepreneurial 
innovation, and establish a dynamic, diverse AI economy. 
7. Cross-Industry Innovation and Technology TransferPolicies should encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and the transfer of technologies 
between industries to multiply AI's economic and societal benefits. A notable real-world 
example includes Harman International’s acquisition of Caaresys, an automotive AI company 
developing radar sensing technology to monitor driver vital signs. Initially designed for 
automotive safety, such sensor technology is actively being explored for potential emergency 


healthcare applications, demonstrating how cross-industry innovation drives economic growth 
and societal advancement. 
8. AI-Enhanced Transportation Ecosystem
Transportation infrastructure presents a significant opportunity for AI-driven transformation. 
Policies should prioritize integrating AI into roads, highways, transportation management 
systems, automated trucking with dedicated lanes, and AI-integrated smart urban planning. 
Practical examples such as AI-managed traffic systems and predictive maintenance solutions 
already deployed in cities underscore the feasibility and substantial benefits of AI integration, delivering enhanced safety, economic productivity, and sustainable urban development. 
9. Strategic Intellectual Property (IP) Policies
Given ongoing legal developments regarding AI-generated innovations, the Action Plan should 
clearly articulate updated IP guidelines. While current U.S. law requires human inventorship and 
authorship for IP rights, global discussions led by bodies such as the World Intellectual Property 
Organization (WIPO) signal the necessity for policy evolution. The Action Plan should 
proactively address these challenges by encouraging IP frameworks that clarify ownership of AI-
generated outputs, balance incentives for innovation with public access, and leverage AI itself to 
improve IP management processes. 
10. Transparency, Explainability, and Public Trust
AI implementations across government and industry require robust transparency and 
accountability. Clear explanations of AI-driven decision-making processes, independent auditing 
protocols, and mechanisms for public feedback and dispute resolution are critical to maintaining 
public confidence. Real-world initiatives such as the UK's Algorithmic Transparency Recording 
Standard serve as practical examples, underscoring the necessity for similar policies in the 
United States. 
11. Strategic AI Talent Development
Developing a diverse, adaptable AI workforce through targeted education and workforce 
programs is crucial. Initiatives should integrate multiple cognitive approaches—linear, nonlinear, 
decentralized, systemic, and intuitive—to equip professionals comprehensively. While AI 
education and workforce strategies exist broadly, explicitly combining these cognitive 
approaches provides an innovative, comprehensive educational foundation essential for 
addressing complex AI challenges and maintaining competitive national advantage. 


Thank you again for the opportunity to contribute to this important process. The above 
recommendations, grounded in current practice, legal realities, and innovative thinking, will 
position the United States as a global leader in responsible, sustainable, and transformative AI 
innovation.
