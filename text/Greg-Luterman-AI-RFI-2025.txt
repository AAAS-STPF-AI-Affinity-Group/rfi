My name is Gregory Luterman, and I'm a registered voter in Madison, AL 35758.Please do not change the copyright laws. AI is bad technology that the general public doesn't
want. Companies are just looking for a way to steal our hard work so they can lay us off. AI isa waste of electricity, and the companies creating it have broken the law in stealingcopyrighted material to train it. They need to be jailed, not permitted to continue.
