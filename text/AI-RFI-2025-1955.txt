General Comment
I'm  strongly opposed to giving AI com panies any additional latitude. Generative AI is a dead-end technology and it com es at the costs of
artists and writers and developers, all the people who actually build this country and m ake our culture great. Generative AI as espoused
by google and openAI are only good for wealth transfer, and I'm  vehem ently opposed to it.
