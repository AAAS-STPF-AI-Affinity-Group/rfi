General Comment
AI actively steals from  hard working creators without perm ission, including big nam e com panies stealing from  sm aller groups. Not only
does this create an unethical and anti-creative bankruptcy, but the output of m aterial by OpenAI is incorrect at best and catastrophically
dangerous at worst. Letting OpenAI do what it wants gives scam m ers, con-artists (both literal and figurative), and num erous governm ent
actors to release dangerous and potentially illegal m aterial, without any repercussions. Not to m ention how it would kill econom ic
creativity in a way no one would have ever im agined.
Making this plan is absurd and a slap to the m illions of people who are at risk of having their likeness, their inform ation, as well as those
around them , used without perm ission for who knows what?
This cannot go into effect, period.
