General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft of m y labor. ART is Labor!
AI is wasteful and doesn't do anything we can't already do better and m ore accurately. 
It's lazy and wasting resources.
I find it ethically and m orally wrong to train a com puter to steal from  hum an artists.
It's also unethical to give AI the opportunity to m ake decisions that only hum ans should m ake, such as life-saving m edical decisions. It is
anti-dem ocratic and will lead to fascist policies because we will be unable to train hum an bias out of the AI, and once the com puter is
m aking these decisions there will be no hum an that can be held accountable, giving com panies free reign to treat the populace however it
likes, as long as a com puter has done it and not a hum an.
