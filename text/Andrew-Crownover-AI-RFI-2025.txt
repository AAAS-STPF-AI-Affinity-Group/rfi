Andrew Crownover, 
Tech com panies should have to pay to license the data they train on. They have the means 
and the money t o do so. A number of companies have already struck deals so the proposal 
that it’s too expensive an option is false. They essentially are afraid of being inconvenienced 
not disadvantaged. Let’s not let the these companies get lazy and destroy entire economic 
ecosystems on promises they may not even be able to fulﬁll. Keep in mind, people like Sam 
Altman don’t have to live with their mistakes. The rest of us do. Don’t let Silicon Valley 
determine what other people’s property should be used for.
