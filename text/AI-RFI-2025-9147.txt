General Comment
The proliferation of generative AI technology has raises critical ethical and legal concerns—particularly regarding the unauthorized use of
copyrighted im ages and data. Copyright law exists to protect the intellectual property rights of creators, ensuring their work is respected,
acknowledged, and fairly com pensated. When generative AI system s are trained on or use such m aterial without proper consent or
licensing, it underm ines the value of creative labor and com prom ises the principles of fair use. It also m akes creators afraid to create
anym ore. 
Moreover, generative AI has the potential to be weaponized in disinform ation cam paigns. For instance, m anipulated content—like
fabricated videos of public figures in com prom ising or false scenarios—can spread rapidly, eroding trust and fueling m isinform ation. A
notable exam ple is the digitally altered video of Elon Musk kissing Donald Trum p, which highlights how such technology can distort reality
and m islead audiences.
