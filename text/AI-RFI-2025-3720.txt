General Comment
I do not believe generative AI is the future for Am erica or the world. I believe it is a fleeting fad sim ilar to NFTs or the Metaverse. The
guardrails on AI should rem ain to prevent the theft of copyrighted m aterial by AI com panies and to protect artists, writers, etc. working
both independently and for larger com panies.
