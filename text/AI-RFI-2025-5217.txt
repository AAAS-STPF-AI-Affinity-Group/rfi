General Comment
This is the wrong way to use "AI" and this is only theft of the entire world's people, including in the United States. I don't believe this "AI"
and this m ethod of gaining data is the future of the world. Allowing "AI" to gain access to copyrights and restricted data is also a m atter of
national security. This needs to stop now! Do not allow AI to train off data and works from  others who did not consent to it.
