General Comment
As a software engineer, I've seen tech leap without looking m ore often than I'd like. Allowing AI to build on (and often outright steal)
original content without the consent of the creators has been (and could get even m ore) disastrous and ethically wrong. Those creators
whose ideas and work were stolen deserve the right to a day in court.
