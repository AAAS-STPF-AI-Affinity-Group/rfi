I would urge the administration; in crafting it's action plans, to not overlook the importance of 
requiring the inclusion of ethical and moral controls in any new AI that is created. Artificial 
intelligence can and will be a great help to mankind. We just need to ensure that we create 
safeguards to protect us from the drawbacks of turning over tasks to a non -biological 
consciousness.
