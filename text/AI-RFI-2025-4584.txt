General Comment
the developm ent of AI does nothing to prom ote hum an flourishing or national security. It will in fact do the opposite. Use of AI is having a
negative im pact on our environm ent and there is no way for it to function without doing so. AI steals and regurgitates inform ation, it does
not learn and it does not think. That is what hum ans do.
