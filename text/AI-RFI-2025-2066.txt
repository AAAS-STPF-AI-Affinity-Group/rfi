General Comment
The use of generative AI has never been useful to anyone. It is inaccurate, it loses m oney, it dam ages the environm ent, and it steals the
work of real hum an beings. People lose their jobs to AI program s that do not work while the people that rem ain em ployed are forced to
do m ore work to com pensate. Using AI dim inishes one's critical thinking skills. The m ore we us AI, the dum ber we get. AI weakens
Am erica as a nation. If the United States m ust lead the developm ent of AI in any way, it should be in regulating it out of existence.
