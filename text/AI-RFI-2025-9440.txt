General Comment
Allowing AI to steal hum an creations without com pensation or the protections copyrights provide is going to kill creativity and innovation
in this country.
We are pouring m illions of dollars and destroying our legal protections for a tech oligarch boondoggle that m any tim es have turned out to
be scam s using overseas hum an labor to create a faux experience of AI, and it will be as m uch of a pointless waste as investing in
cryptocurrency.
Waste of effort, waste of water and power, waste of m oney, waste of breath trying to m ake this insane dream  a nightm arish reality.
Also with the CHIPS act being axed by the adm inistration, it will cost ten tim es m ore to try and m eet this dem and for physical tech
infrastructure and data centers when we cant m ake our own m icrochips and have to beg China and Taiwan to let us buy them  at inflated
trade-war rates now.
Take that AI m oney and put it back into CHIPS factories, and we will be ten tim es stronger with real physical m anufacturing rather than
another useless AI program  for people's phones.
