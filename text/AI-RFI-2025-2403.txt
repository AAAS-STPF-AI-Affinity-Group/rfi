General Comment
Leading AI experts, such as Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton and Turing Award winner Yoshua Bengio, estim ate a 20-50% chance
that continued AI developm ent will lead to the extinction of hum anity, as AI m odels far sm arter than hum ans pursue their own goals and
view hum an interference as an obstacle to those goals. This is an unacceptable risk, vastly higher than the risk of hum an extinction from
nuclear war or any other cause. Therefore, please prioritize preventing hum an extinction over all other priorities. Thank you.
