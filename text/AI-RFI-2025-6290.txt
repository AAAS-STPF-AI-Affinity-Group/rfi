General Comment
Allowing any AI com pany to use the work of artists and writers no m atter what is stealing from  those artists and writers. End of story. It is
as if som eone walked into a store and took som ething off the shelf without paying and walking off with it, because they decided they were
owed it. AI learning from  works without the artist's express perm ission every single tim e is theft. Do not let this becom e a reality in
Am erica.
