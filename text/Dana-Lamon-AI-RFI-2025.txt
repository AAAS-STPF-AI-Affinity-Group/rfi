The belief that artificial intelligence as it exists now, largely as algorithmic duplication of the
works of others, is the future of technology is erroneous.
The benefits of AI are fabricated and our increasing technological and economic use of it do
severe harm to industry, the economy and the American people.  
We do not need fewer "guardrails," around AI, we need more. Indeed, we need outrightbarriers against AI and the theft of the artistic works of true human ingenuity AI requires tofuel it's unsustainable algorithmic duplication. Copyright and Trademark laws are just one wayto protect us from the technological dead end that AI represents. Do not weaken these laws;strengthen them.
Thank you.
