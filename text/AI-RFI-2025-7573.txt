General Comment
The idea of infringing on not only personal but corporate copyright will have long lasting and devastating im pact on com m ercial, individual,
and intellectual rights for decades to com e all without any path of recourse or regulation for these com panies and individuals. Not even to
m ention the effects on the environm ent with how m any resources AI itself burns through at a frankly alarm ing rate. Please reconsider
allowing this blatant spit in the face of our rights to be passed with no fight or plan of action.
