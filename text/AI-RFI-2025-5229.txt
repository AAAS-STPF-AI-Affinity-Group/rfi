General Comment
Words cannot express how dangerous it is to allow AI m odels to train unrestrained and unregulated — AI already has a public reputation
for being inefficient, inaccurate, and an overall untrustworthy and unwanted sector of tech “innovation” that disrupts not only people’s
livelihoods, but also our lim ited natural resources and assets. I can assure you that not only will this push to deregulate AI result in a
degradation of the entertainm ent industry that serves as such a cornerstone of the Am erican econom y and cultural output (both dom estic
and abroad), but will also establish a dangerous precedent in the country encouraging an overreliance on AI — one only needs to study
how ChatGPT has dam aged our schools and student populations already to understand where this kind of technology will lead us
culturally and intellectually. For the good of our country and those who call it hom e, don’t let AI run ram pant. There are better ways to
m aintain national security than handing it to private AI barons.
