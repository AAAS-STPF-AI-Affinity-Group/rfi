General Comment
Quite sim ply, if you cannot do som ething without breaking the law, then that act is by definition a CRIME. These AI com panies are
explicitly and knowingly com m uting countless crim inal acts each and every day.
If a citizen or sm all Buisness downloaded every single Disney m ovie, then sold those m ovie on a m ass scale, would they not face serious
legal repercussions? 
Even if they slapped random  filters or used every asset of these film s in a random  assortm ent of clips and audio lines, would they not still
be taken to court for piracy and illegal reselling of copyrighted m aterial? 
We cannot allow one law for regurgitated slop churned out by resource depleting, soulless m achines whilst talented artists, writers, and
creators are left uncom pensated for work done and forced out of these industries.
The death of creation is the death of the hum an soul.
