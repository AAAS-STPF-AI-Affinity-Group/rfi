General Comment
As a burgeoning artist developing her skills, I do not believe generative AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica:
Even if it has any short term  benefits, the long term  consequences on the artist econom y, environm ental risks, and m any other factors that
AI is connected to.. The loss would be far m ore than any m anner of gains one m ight pose as a executive of a com pany developing this
technology.
The loss of m orale on part of m any people who would lose access to hum an m ade art, and have to constantly discern through what is
hum an m ade and what is m ade through AI, as well as the endless schlock that would be toothless in term s of content, the elem ent that we
have prided ourselves on for centuries would be gone.
I doubt you would adm it that is your m otivation, but I will say this anyway: Your support of this technology conveys that your goal is
undoubtedly the dem oralization and hopelessness of hum ankind, so that other goals you wish to achieve will be achieved faster, at the
behest and degradation of everything hum anity holds dear.
Do the right thing, and kill the weed known as generative AI technology with prejudice.
