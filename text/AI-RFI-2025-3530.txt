General Comment
The existence of large language m odels and Generative Ai in their current state rely solely on theft of artists, writers, and any person who
has posted or had anything about them  posted to the internet. Their business practices tram ple all established copyright law. Rich tech
com panies steal our words, im ages, and lives to build an ineffective product to peddle the public to further enrich them selves. This cannot
be allowed to stand.
