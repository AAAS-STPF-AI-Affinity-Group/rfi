General Comment
Do NOT under ANY circum stances let AI program s freely screen copyrighted m aterial! Do NOT give free access to AI program s to
steal from  genuine works by people, ESPECIALLY when said m aterial is copyright protected. AI openly steals from  artists and pushes
out content that is worse in quality. Not only that, AI program s steal away work and jobs from  hardworking Am ericans! ANY use of
Artificial Intelligence to generate content is PLAGIARISM and THEFT! Any developm ent of AI program s will threaten the livelihoods of
an untold num ber of hardworking Am erican workers, and will be the death of hum an innovation, intelligence, and creativity. DO NOT
DEVELOP OR USE AI FOR ANY REASON!
