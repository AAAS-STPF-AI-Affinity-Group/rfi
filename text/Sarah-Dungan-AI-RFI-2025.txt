Generative AI is labor theft. In the supplementary  information the phrase 'promote
human flourishing’ is used; Generative AI is the opposite of human flourishing. It is
specifically trying to replace human creativity and labor with derivative  computer
generated copies of the stolen human labor that was used to create it. To removecopyright impediments to encourage AI development would be both harmful to mypersonal livelihood and to the ability of corporations to police their own trademarksand copyrights.
Beyond that, AI isn’t truly helpful in a huge number of the applications in which 
 it’s
currently being used. It  regularly ‘hallucinates’ incorrect information. It’s well known
that the AI summary on the Google search screen can and often does contain
incorrect information (something reported by Google’s own internal research). I do notbelieve AI holds a place in the future of the US. It is an overhyped tool being taughtby venture capitalists who want to make a fast payout by convincing everyone that itis the ’next big thing’ - rebranding machine learning and large language models‘artificial intelligence’ to sell the idea.
Sincerely,
