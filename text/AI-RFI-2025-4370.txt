General Comment
As a person working in a creative field, lifting another person’s work wholesale with no perm ission or credit would be wholly
inappropriate (and wholly illegal). Why is it any different if a com puter is doing it? Generative AI is an incredibly dangerous thing for our
entire cultural output & can very well destroy entire industries and livelihoods. Reducing som eone’s blood, sweat, & tears to a series of
zeroes & ones and leaving it an em otionless shell is anathem a to any understanding of hum an cultural exchange as well as sim ply absurd.
One of the things that m akes us hum an is our ability to pour our lives, experiences, em otions, and souls into these artistic vessels as an
indelible m essage to the universe that “I am  here!” A com puter will never experience nor understand and cannot experience nor
understand the breadth, depth, and em otional content of the hum an condition. To even pretend otherwise is obscene and an affront to
every hum an that lived before you and will live after you.
Thank you for your consideration.
