To Whom It May Concern:
To the extent that this public comment solicitation is not a joke, I am writing to give my
opinion as a citizen of this country. “But I’m going to do something really cool with it” is nota reason to allow theft. The rights of a creator to profit from their own work is surely intrinsicto the statement - it is their own work. I know that tech billionaires have already purchasedthis morally bankrupt change in law, and that this and all other comments you receive that areagainst it will be used as so much toilet paper, but Might does not make Right. If AI cannot betrained without such blatant corruption, AI should not be trained.
