General Comment
Al com panies should be held to the rules of the land and not get a special carve out for harm ing Am ericans and their works. AI should not
allow com panies to be able to bypass copyright restrictions by “studying” other people’s work/content. AI has no place in the future of
the U.S. All it has brought us is pain, suffering, m isinform ation, and ignorance.
