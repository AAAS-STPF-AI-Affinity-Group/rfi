General Comment
By going through with this you will kill what little is left of hum an creativity. 
I beg of you to think of the artists, writers, m akers who create their work by pulling inspiration from  the depths of their soul. A way of life
that has persevered for thousands of years, even now, in this era of soul sucking consum erist capitalist system . If this passes, then
everything beautiful m ade by m an will be replaced by m achine, so that those m en will have no other choice but to work to death whilst the
creators of AI live perfect lives built on the blood of m illions. 
DO NOT LET THIS PASS. 
PLEASE.
