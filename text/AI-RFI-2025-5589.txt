General Comment
No thank you. This isn't AI, it's a theft engine. Everyone should be able to receive com pensation for the wholesale theft of hum an m ade art
and writings. 
OpenAI in particular should receive no special status and there should be m ore guardrails to protect data these com panies steal.
