General Comment
AI is nothing but a detrim ent to hum an society and would wholly harm  national security as well as the daily lives of ordinary US citizens if it
is used for governm ental purposes. It is trained off of stolen works protected by the Copyright Act of 1976 and further such laws
protecting original works, and these works are stolen indiscrim inately, leading to incorrect inform ation and im perfect results, which would
seriously harm  national security. For exam ple, if AI was used to detect a nuclear strike with even a slight error rate, the US m ay
inadvertently plunge the world into World War III. In addition, the usage of AI artwork, m usic, or text by the Federal Governm ent of the
United States would be - and is - seen as utterly unprofessional, by both Am erican citizens and the international stage alike. The usage of
AI by any governm ental agency should be strictly banned, and AI should not be allowed to train on copyright protected works.
