General Comment
If the "action plan" is not to protect ALL COPYRIGHT from  unauthorized usage in training artificial intelligence and learning m odels, then
it should be illegal. Period. Am erica doesn't have an "AI dom inance," Am erica has an illegal use of copyrighted and tradem arked
m aterials.
