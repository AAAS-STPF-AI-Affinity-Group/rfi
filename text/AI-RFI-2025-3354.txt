General Comment
Can't tell if m y first com m ent got saved (because the m eans to view other com m ents on this site is, frankly, unintuitive and feels broken
that m ultiple keywords yielded no com m ents at all), but I'll leave another again: generative AI like that which OpenAI and its founder, Sam
Altm an, espouse, have no place in Am erica's future; far from  it; they leech off of other options for Am erica's future growth and steal a
future away from  countless creatives by exploiting their work for corporate gain.
Public dom ain & copyright have a com plicated relationship, but there's nothing "com plicated" about what Altm an's desires. OpenAI sees
copyright as an obstacle, an im pedim ent to their ability to steal whatever m edia they want to replicate through a m achine, devaluing not
only the creative process but the hundreds of thousands of artists, m usicians, film m akers, actors & others who create the pillars OpenAI
stands on through their theft. They lie to the Am erican public about a potential it has not lived up to, overhype their results and dem and
m ore resources than they ever give back to people through their system s, and they have no right to ask for MORE when the results
they've gotten from  AI thus far barely justify what they've already (non-consensually) stolen to use it. Am erica does not need intelligence
like OpenAI to becom e great, it never did, and it never WILL.
