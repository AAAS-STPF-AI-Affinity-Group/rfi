General Comment
Generative AI provides zero value to the entertainm ent and com m unication industries. The "art" it produces is plagiarized at worst, and
soulless at best. The very usage of LLMs is actively eroding the intellectual and creative abilities of the hum an race, and allowing open
training of these m odels on copyrighted m aterial will only serve to further reduce the ability of the United States to produce citizens that
can advance society or com pete on the world stage.
What OpenAI and other LLM com panies are selling is hype, with no capability or intention of ever producing a real product. Do not
allow them  to rob m ore value from  the Am erican people in order to line their pockets with investor m oney.
