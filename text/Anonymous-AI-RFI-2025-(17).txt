Generative  Large Language models ar e an e mbarassing  garbage technology, peddle d by 
deranged little conmen. While there are a few uses for this technology in some scientific fields, 
it is, for the most part, a hilariously costly bull %^&* machine that runs on a massive amount of 
theft. Even ignoring the damage it causes to the US power grid, the environmental and energy 
costs, the mountains of copyrighted material that is plagiarised, and the studies that show that 
consistant use of  this technology  is harmful for  people's c ritical thinking  skills, there i s yet to be 
any evidence that this technology can be sustainably profitable. Generative Large Language 
models are not scary or impressive , they're just trash that has been hype d up by marketers and a 
tech m edia that i s far to credulous of companies that ar e obviously tryi ng to scam society. I 
cannot stress enough that this technology does not have a sustainable future, Generative Large 
Language models require constant a ccess of  up to da te human m ade dat a in order to occasionally 
hallucinat e useful  summaries, how ever the flood of generated hallucinations will devalue and 
economically choke out the humans who would create the very data that Large Language models 
require to functi on. I do not unde rstand how so much of societ y is so completely enraptured by 
this very scam. The AI bubbl e is going to do a great deal of damage when it pops , and that 
damage will be even more serious if the US gove rnment is foolish enough to further invest in 
Large Language model technologies. I would very strongl y ask the gove rnment to not only 
disinves t from this tr ash te chnology,  but also to w ork to regulate it for  its plagiaris m and energy  
costs. T hanks.
