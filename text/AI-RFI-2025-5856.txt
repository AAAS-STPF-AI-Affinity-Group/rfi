A Market-Based Approach to AI Alignm ent
Im agine AI system s with clear, verifiable com m itm ents—where the m ost profitable AI system s are naturally the m ost trustworthy ones.
This is achievable through the Agency Protocol, a fram ework creating m arket incentives for responsible AI behavior.
Unlike approaches forcing alignm ent through regulations or technical guardrails, the Agency Protocol builds a trust ecosystem  where
keeping prom ises becom es m ore profitable than breaking them . This solution works with any technology platform  while creating econom ic
forces that naturally align AI behavior with hum an values.
The Challenge: Why Current Approaches Fall Short
Current AI alignm ent efforts face lim itations holding back Am erican innovation:
• Im plicitly encoded values create black boxes with opaque decision-m aking
• Verifying alignm ent becom es harder as system s grow com plex
• Few financial incentives exist for honest capability assessm ent
• Regulations often slow innovation without im proving safety
• Hum an oversight doesn't scale as AI system s m ultiply
The Agency Protocol Solution
The Agency Protocol introduces five innovations transform ing how we establish trust in AI:
1. Explicit Prom ises, Not Vague Assurances
The protocol requires explicit prom ises about specific behaviors with clear verification requirem ents.
An AI m edical advisor wouldn't just claim  to be "safe" but would prom ise "I will indicate when a question falls outside m y training data"
and "I will provide confidence levels with recom m endations."
2. Dom ain-Specific Reputation
We know expertise doesn't transfer across dom ains—a brilliant physicist isn't autom atically a great doctor. Yet AI system s often receive
blanket trust across unrelated areas.


The protocol tracks trustworthiness separately in different dom ains. An AI m ight excel at m athem atics but perform  poorly on ethical
judgm ents—distinctions visible to users and regulators.
3. Skin in the Gam e
AI system s m ust stake valuable resources on their prom ises—com putational access, licenses, or privileges—placed at risk when
com m itm ents are m ade.
This creates econom ic consequences for poor perform ance. System s prom ising m ore than they can deliver face penalties im pacting their
operation, creating m arket pressure for honest capability assessm ent.
4. Distributed Trust Verification
No single entity controls how AI system s are evaluated. Multiple assessors—hum ans and other AI system s—evaluate prom ises, creating
accountability that resists m anipulation.
5. Earning Advanced Capabilities
System s m ust dem onstrate reliability before earning the right to operate autonom ously.
This creates a natural evolution where the m ost capable system s have proven track records, not just sophisticated designs.
Strategic Advantages for Am erican Leadership
Market Forces Drive Alignm ent
By m aking honest behavior econom ically advantageous, the protocol harnesses m arket forces rather than regulatory com pliance.
Com panies are rewarded for accurate claim s and reliable perform ance.
Innovation Without Constraint
Unlike prescriptive regulations dictating technical approaches, the protocol focuses on outcom es while leaving im plem entation to
developers, accelerating innovation while m aintaining safeguards.
Proportional Protection
Oversight scales with risk: security applications receive com prehensive verification, while com m ercial applications advance with lighter
requirem ents.
Data Rights Done Right
The protocol creates accountability for training data usage, addressing ethical issues through m arket m echanism s rather than one-size-fits-
all rules.
Protecting Intellectual Property
Com panies dem onstrate trustworthiness without com prom ising com petitive advantages.
Policy Recom m endations
To integrate this approach into the AI Action Plan, we recom m end:
1. Establish an AI Trust Infrastructure Initiative developing standards for prom ise-based alignm ent
2. Im plem ent Merit-Based Capability Standards linking reliability to allowed capabilities 
3. Create Econom ic Incentives through procurem ent preferences rewarding verifiable AI
4. Develop a Merit Registry tracking dom ain-specific reliability for critical applications
5. Set Resource Staking Requirem ents for AI system s in sensitive dom ains
Conclusion
The Agency Protocol transform s how we approach AI alignm ent, enhancing Am erica's technological leadership while ensuring trustworthy
system s. Instead of viewing safety and innovation as com peting priorities, it creates conditions where they naturally reinforce each other.
This infrastructure-independent approach aligns with Executive Order 14179 by enhancing AI developm ent through m arket m echanism s
rather than burdensom e requirem ents—enabling Am erican com panies to innovate while building verifiable trust.

1. 1. Abstract Abstract
This paper analyzes the game-theoretic properties of the Agency
Protocol and demonstrates that under appropriate parameterization,promise-keeping emerges as the unique subgame perfect Nashequilibrium, robust even to coordinated manipulation attempts bycoalitions. By integrating tools from game theory and informationtheory, we establish conditions under which rational agents ﬁnd honestbehavior utility-maximizing. We analyze resistance to manipulationattempts and collusion, and examine the dynamic stability ofcooperative behavior. The Protocol's novel merit-credit mechanismcreates incentives where truthfulness becomes economicallyadvantageous—not through external enforcement, but as an emergentproperty of the system's design. Our theoretical analysis iscomplemented by concrete implementation details showing how theseproperties translate to practical mechanisms.
2. 2. Prior Work and Theoretical FoundationsPrior Work and Theoretical Foundations
The Agency Protocol builds upon a rich tradition of research in gametheory, mechanism design, and trust systems. Rather than claiming todiscover entirely new principles, we integrate established theoreticalfoundations with novel implementation approaches to create acomprehensive trust infrastructure.
2.1. 2.1. Mechanism Design and Truth-Telling Incentives Mechanism Design and Truth-Telling Incentives
Many of the economic incentives in the Agency Protocol drawinspiration from fundamental work in mechanism design—the scienceof creating rules that align individual incentives with desired outcomes.
2.1.1. 2.1.1. Truthful Mechanisms  Truthful Mechanisms
The concept of designing mechanisms where honest behavior emerges
as equilibrium strategy has deep roots:
1.Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Mechanisms
VCG mechanisms, pioneered by William Vickrey, Edward Clarke,
and Theodore Groves, demonstrate that auction systems can bedesigned where bidding one's true value is a dominant strategy.These principles have seen widespread adoption in digitaladvertising markets and resource allocation systems.
The Agency Protocol extends these insights beyond simple
auctions to complex promise-assessment relationships, creatingeconomic conditions where honesty becomes the utility-maximizing choice.
2.Proper Scoring Rules
When eliciting predictions or private information, proper scoring
rules create payment structures that reward accuracy. A forecastermaximizes their expected score by truthfully reporting their beliefsrather than strategically misreporting.
Our assessment staking system builds on this foundation, creating
rewards that align with honest evaluation rather than strategicmanipulation.
3.Strategy-Proof Matching
In domains without monetary transfers, from school choice to
organ donation, mechanism designers have created systems wheretruthful preference revelation is optimal. The Gale-Shapleydeferred acceptance algorithm and its variants have beenimplemented in numerous real-world contexts speciﬁcally toeliminate strategic manipulation.
The Agency Protocol's domain-speciﬁc merit approach draws
inspiration from these systems while extending their capabilities tomore complex trust relationships.
2.1.2. 2.1.2. Repeated Games and Cooperation  Repeated Games and Cooperation
The subgame perfect equilibrium properties of the Protocol builddirectly on established results in the theory of repeated games:
1.The Folk Theorem
The Folk Theorem demonstrates that in inﬁnitely repeated games
with sufﬁciently patient players, cooperation can emerge asequilibrium behavior even when defection would be optimal inone-shot interactions. The threat of future punishment sustainscooperative behavior in the present.
Our formal model explicitly acknowledges this connection,
showing how the Agency Protocol creates conditions that satisfyand extend the Folk Theorem's requirements in a decentralizedcontext.
2.Relational Contracting
Economic research on relational contracting shows how self-
enforcing agreements emerge when parties value ongoingrelationships. Firms maintain quality or timely delivery not due toexternal enforcement but because breaching trust would destroyvaluable future opportunities.
The Agency Protocol formalizes these dynamics through its merit
and credit systems, creating quantiﬁable future opportunity valuethat makes promise-keeping the rational strategy.
2.2. 2.2. Reputation Systems and Trust Reputation Systems and Trust
Beyond pure mechanism design, the Protocol builds on extensive workin reputation and trust systems:
2.2.1. 2.2.1. Collaborative Filtering  Collaborative Filtering
Matrix factorization techniques that help identify underlying patterns
in assessment data draw from collaborative ﬁltering research inrecommendation systems. These approaches help separate genuineconsensus from coordinated manipulation.
2.2.2. 2.2.2. Decentralized Reputation  Decentralized Reputation
Blockchain-based reputation systems have explored various approaches
to creating manipulation-resistant trust signals. Projects like Augur andKleros use staking mechanisms and Schelling point coordination toincentivize truthful reporting.
The Agency Protocol incorporates lessons from these systems while
addressing key limitations through domain-speciﬁc merit andprogressive cost barriers to manipulation.
2.2.3. 2.2.3. Social Trust Research  Social Trust Research
Sociological and psychological research on trust formation informs our
approach to trust propagation and contextual assessment. The domain-speciﬁc nature of our merit system reﬂects empirical ﬁndings abouthow humans actually evaluate and extend trust in different contexts.
2.3. 2.3. Our Contributions Our Contributions
Building on these foundations, the Agency Protocol makes severaldistinct contributions:
2.3.1. 2.3.1. Integration of Theoretical Frameworks  Integration of Theoretical Frameworks
While individual concepts have precedent, the Protocol integrates
mechanism design, information theory, and reputation systems into acohesive framework with formal guarantees. This synthesis createspowerful new capabilities that isolated approaches cannot achieve.
2.3.2. 2.3.2. Domain-Speciﬁc Trust Architecture  Domain-Speciﬁc Trust Architecture
Unlike most existing systems that collapse reputation into simpliﬁed
metrics, our domain-speciﬁc approach prevents reputation launderingand creates context-appropriate trust signals. This addressesfundamental limitations in current reputation systems.
2.3.3. 2.3.3. Practical Implementation Pathway  Practical Implementation Pathway
We bridge theory and practice through detailed technical architecture
and staged implementation. Rather than remaining theoretical, theProtocol provides concrete approaches for realizing complicated game-theoretic principles in practical systems.
2.3.4. 2.3.4. Dynamic Evolution Capabilities  Dynamic Evolution Capabilities
Our staged evolution of both merit and credit systems creates a
pathway from simple implementations to sophisticated collectiveintelligence. This evolutionary approach allows the system to bootstraptrust within its own framework.
The Agency Protocol does not claim to overturn established principles
of mechanism design or game theory. Instead, it applies these principlesin novel ways, extends them to new domains, and creates practicalimplementations that transform theoretical possibilities into functionaltrust infrastructure.
In the following section, we'll examine how these theoretical
foundations translate into a concrete implementation roadmap.
3. 3. Roadmap Roadmap
This paper integrates several strands of theory and practice—gametheory, information theory, repeated games, and mechanism design—toargue that promise-keeping emerges as a rational strategy under theAgency Protocol. Below is a concise roadmap:
1.Introduction and Core IntuitionIntroduction and Core Intuition  Describes how trust problems
manifest in decentralized systems and introduces the dual-currency concept (merit and credits). Establishes the basic vision:shift isolated interactions into connected sequences wherehonesty is more proﬁtable than defection.
2.Formal ModelFormal Model  Presents the mathematical notation, utility
functions, stake requirements, and information-theoretic metrics.This section deﬁnes core variables and assumptions that allsubsequent theorems build on.
3.Core Equilibrium AnalysisCore Equilibrium Analysis  Lays out single-round and repeated-
game arguments, proving that promise-keeping can be a bestresponse in each round and a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium inthe iterated setting (Theorems 1–4).
4.Manipulation ResistanceManipulation Resistance  Demonstrates how coalitions
attempting to collude or provide dishonest assessments faceexponentially increasing costs versus linearly bounded beneﬁts(Theorems 5–7). It uses Kullback–Leibler divergence–basedmechanisms and stake penalties.
5.System Stability and DynamicsSystem Stability and Dynamics  Analyzes Lyapunov stability,
convergence, and feedback loops. Shows that even if some agentsdeviate, the system tends to return to cooperative behavior underappropriate parameterization (Theorems 8–10).
6.Connecting to the Folk TheoremConnecting to the Folk Theorem  Compares the Protocol’s
cooperative equilibrium with classical repeated-game results,explaining how we implement and extend the Folk Theorem’sconditions (e.g. persistent identities, monitoring, discount factors)in a decentralized context.
7.Practical Implementation and Edge CasesPractical Implementation and Edge Cases  Details how the
theoretical insights map onto real-world features: stakeadjustments, batch processing, governance agents, multi-domainmerit, coalition detection, etc. Addresses cold start challenges,domain boundary disputes, and decision-making failures.
8.Conclusion and ImplicationsConclusion and Implications  Summarizes the conditions under
which promise-keeping and honest assessment emerge as therational choices. Highlights broader implications for decentralizedtrust, mechanism design, and long-term stability of collaborativedigital ecosystems.
9.AppendicesAppendices  Provides deeper dives into matrix factorization for
assessing manipulative patterns, zero-knowledge proofs forgovernance mechanisms, parameter-sensitivity analyses, and anyextended references.
This roadmap ensures that readers see how the major sections ﬁttogether: from basic deﬁnitions (Section 2) and equilibrium arguments(Section 3) to the real-world details that make those arguments robust(Sections 4–7) and the wrap-up of implications (Sections 8–9).
4. 4. Introduction and Core IntuitionIntroduction and Core Intuition
Trust underlies human cooperation but remains notoriously difﬁcult toreliably achieve in decentralized digital environments. Existing trustand reputation systems commonly suffer from vulnerabilities includingsimplistic reputation metrics, gaming susceptibility, and inadequatecontext sensitivity. The Agency Protocol addresses these issues byintroducing a sophisticated dual-currency mechanism—transferablecredits and non-transferable, domain-speciﬁc merit—whichsystematically makes honest behavior economically advantageous.
Drawing explicitly from mechanism design, repeated game theory, and
information theory, the Protocol structures economic conditions suchthat keeping promises and assessing honestly emerge naturally asuniquely rational, utility-maximizing strategies. By linking currentbehavior to future economic opportunities, the Protocol transformsisolated interactions into interconnected sequences where long-termgains clearly outweigh short-term temptations to defect.
Speciﬁcally, this paper demonstrates:
Conditions under which promise-keeping forms a subgame perfect
Nash equilibrium.
Uniqueness and coalition-proofness of this equilibrium, preventingstable dishonest equilibria.
Robust resistance to manipulation through exponentiallyincreasing detection costs for dishonest coalitions.
Dynamic stability and rapid convergence to cooperative behaviorunder realistic parameterization.
Collectively, these theoretical and practical contributions represent asigniﬁcant advance beyond existing trust mechanisms by providing areliable and economically coherent foundation for cooperation indecentralized systems.
4.1. 4.1. 1.1 A Critical Advance in Trust Systems 1.1 A Critical Advance in Trust Systems
The Agency Protocol represents a signiﬁcant advancement beyondexisting trust and reputation systems. Traditional reputation systemssuffer from three critical ﬂaws:
One-dimensionalityOne-dimensionality : Collapsing diverse attributes into single
scores obscures crucial context
Gaming vulnerabilityGaming vulnerability : Without skin in the game, easy
manipulation through fake reviews or strategic timing
Feedback dilutionFeedback dilution : Bimodal distribution fails to capture nuanced
middle ground
By embracing domain-speciﬁc merit, requiring stake on promises andassessments, and creating veriﬁable evidence chains, the AgencyProtocol addresses these limitations. This is not merely theoretical—theProtocol has been implemented with concrete features addressing eachlimitation:
4.2. 4.2. 1.2 From Theory to Implementation 1.2 From Theory to Implementation
Throughout this paper, we connect the abstract mathematicalproperties with their concrete implementation in the Agency Protocol.The theoretical model has been realized through a concrete feature setthat includes:
Agent Creation and LifecycleAgent Creation and Lifecycle : Cryptographically veriﬁed
identities with content-addressable promises
Merit SystemMerit System : Domain-speciﬁc trust calculation with
sophisticated weighting mechanisms
Credit SystemCredit System : Stake requirements that create economic
consequences for promises
Batch ProcessingBatch Processing : Inference control to prevent gaming through
timing analysis
Decision MakingDecision Making : Integrated consensus, meritocratic, and
democratic mechanisms
These implementations allow us to demonstrate not only that thetheoretical equilibrium exists under speciﬁed conditions, but that it canbe practically achieved through carefully designed systems.

Let  be the set of agents,  the set of domains, and  the set ofpromises.
For agent , domain , and time :

5.2. 5.2. 2.2 Utility Function 2.2 Utility Function
For agent , we deﬁne utility as:
Where:
 is agent 's valuation of credits
 is agent 's valuation of merit in domain 
To ensure proper normalization, we express all utility components in
dimensionless units, allowing for consistent comparison acrossdifferent domains and stake sizes.
5.3. 5.3. 2.3 Merit Impact Functions 2.3 Merit Impact Functions
The merit impact of promise outcomes is:

The stake required for a promise inversely relates to merit:
Where:

 and , where 
The Protocol implements this through the following concrete stake
multipliers:

0.2 to 0.5 0.8 80 credits required
0.5 to 0.8 0.5 50 credits required
0.8 to 1.0 0.2 (minimum

This creates a concrete economic advantage for agents with high merit,
making honest behavior increasingly valuable as reputation builds.
5.5. 5.5. 2.5 Information Value of Assessments 2.5 Information Value of Assessments
When agents assess promises, they contribute information that reducesuncertainty. The information value of assessment  is:
When assessors provide honest assessments, they generate a
distribution  close to the ground truth . The Kullback-Leiblerdivergence  is minimal. Dishonest assessments createdistribution  with signiﬁcantly higher divergence .

For an honest assessment  and dishonest assessment :

outcomes)
Therefore:

This theoretical property is implemented in the Protocol throughconsensus detection mechanisms that quantify divergence in thefollowing ways:
1.Merit-weighted corroboration strength:
2.Explicit detection probability calculation:
These mechanisms ensure that dishonest assessments are bothdetectable and disincentivized.

. Therefore, no agent can increase their utility by
unilaterally deviating from the promise-keeping strategy, which is the
deﬁnition of a Nash equilibrium. ∎
The Protocol implements this through concrete stake requirements
that ensure the theoretical condition is met. For example, a promisewith potential gain  credits in domain  would require:
For an agent with merit 0.2: 
 credits
For an agent with merit 0.8: 
 credits
With the Protocol's merit-based stake adjustment, the actual required
stakes would be:
Low-merit agent (0.2): ~60 credits (full stake)
High-merit agent (0.8): ~12 credits (20% stake)
This demonstrates how the Protocol creates a concrete economicadvantage for high-merit agents while satisfying the theoreticalconditions for Nash equilibrium.

place. place.
Proof Proof : When an agent assesses dishonestly, they risk:
1.Merit loss if the dishonesty is detected (probability )
2.Future opportunity costs from reduced merit
The information-theoretic framework shows that dishonest
assessments contain more "surprising" information (with higher KLdivergence), making them more detectable in an environment whereconsensus reveals truth. The detection probability can be moreprecisely deﬁned as:
Where  is a system parameter controlling detection sensitivity.
The expected utility from honest assessment exceeds that of dishonest
assessment when:
Since both terms on the right are negative, this inequality holds.
Therefore, honest assessment is the best response strategy. ∎
In practice, the Protocol implements this through:
1.Merit-weighted voting:
2.Assessment staking: Assessors stake credits on their assessments,
with stakes returned only if the assessment aligns with consensus
3.Matrix factorization: Identiﬁes and minimizes bias dimensions inassessment patterns, making factional manipulation detectable
These mechanisms create concrete economic consequences fordishonest assessments, ensuring the theoretical incentives translate topractical behavior.

The Protocol implements future opportunity value through:
1.Progressive stake discounts based on merit (as shown in the table
in section 2.4)
2.Domain-speciﬁc merit that creates specialized advantage inrelevant contexts
3.Merit inheritance that allows reputation to inﬂuence relateddomains
These mechanisms ensure that high-merit agents receive concreteeconomic beneﬁts that grow over time, creating powerful incentives forhonest behavior.

Proof Proof : For subgame perfection, we must establish that the cooperative
strategy is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame. We consider two keycases:
On-Path AnalysisOn-Path Analysis : When all agents follow the cooperative strategy, no
agent has an incentive to deviate when:
1.Immediate losses outweigh immediate gains (Theorem 1)
2.Future opportunity cost  (Lemma 2)
3.With , future costs outweigh immediate gains
The properly normalized calculation for  ensures that the discount
factor remains within (0,1) as required by standard game theory. Forcooperative behavior to be optimal, the present value of futureopportunities must exceed the one-time gain from defection:
Solving for , we get:Since  and  are positive,  is always in (0,1).

3.The punishment is agent-speciﬁc, so non-deviators maintaincooperation
Since no agent can proﬁtably deviate in any subgame when theseconditions are met, the cooperative strategy forms a subgame perfectequilibrium. ∎
Using typical Protocol parameter values:
 credits (maximum gain from major promise breaking)
 (normalized credit valuation)
 credits (base stake requirement)
 (maximum merit discount)
 (minimum interaction probability)
We get With the Protocol using , which is higher than , the
cooperative strategy is maintained as the subgame perfect equilibrium.

factors, the cooperative equilibrium is Pareto-optimal withinfactors, the cooperative equilibrium is Pareto-optimal within
the set of subgame perfect equilibria.the set of subgame perfect equilibria.
Proof Proof : While multiple subgame perfect equilibria can exist in repeated
games, the cooperative equilibrium maximizes total utility across
agents. Any equilibrium with promise-breaking yields strictly loweraggregate utility due to:
1.Lost stakes from broken promises
2.Reduced merit accumulation
3.Higher future stake requirements
This means the cooperative equilibrium is Pareto-optimal among theset of possible equilibria. ∎

For a coalition to manipulate outcomes, they must control enough
merit-weighted votes to ensure either  or , requiringcontrol of proportion  of total assessment weight. ∎
Given the Protocol's typical threshold of , a coalition would needto control at least 40% of the merit-weighted assessments tomanipulate outcomes. This becomes increasingly difﬁcult as thenetwork grows and merit becomes distributed, especially with theProtocol's merit-weighted assessment system.

Proof Proof : When a coalition provides dishonest assessments, the
information divergence from truth is:
Where  is the information value of assessment .
Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence framework established in Section
2.5, we quantify how dishonest assessments diverge from ground truth.This gives us a detection probability:
Where  is a system parameter controlling detection sensitivity.
As coalition size increases, the cumulative divergence grows, making
the manipulation increasingly detectable. This creates a detectionprobability that increases exponentially with coalition size. ∎
In practice, the Protocol implements this detection through matrix
factorization that identiﬁes assessment patterns. For example, withtypical parameters:
For a coalition of size n=5 attempting to manipulate domain D:
For aligned assessments (close to truth): D(C||truth) ≈ 5 × 0.074 =
0.37 bits
For divergent assessments: D(C||truth) ≈ 5 × 2.32 = 11.6 bits
With detection sensitivity κ = 0.2:
Aligned coalition: Pdetect  ≈ 1 - exp(-0.2 × 0.37) ≈ 0.07 (7% detection)
Divergent coalition: Pdetect  ≈ 1 - exp(-0.2 × 11.6) ≈ 0.90 (90%
detection)
This creates a high probability of detecting coordinated manipulation,especially as coalition size grows.

Meanwhile, the maximum potential beneﬁt is bounded by:
Although coordination costs grow only super-linearly (not

Since  grows linearly with , the detection

a key inﬂection point in the cost-beneﬁt analysis.

9. 9.The Folk Theorem and Agency ProtocolThe Folk Theorem and Agency Protocol
9.1. 9.1. 6.1 Understanding the Folk Theorem 6.1 Understanding the Folk Theorem
The Folk Theorem (or more accurately, the family of Folk Theorems) ingame theory addresses a fundamental question: How can cooperationemerge among rational, self-interested agents? In its classicformulation, the Folk Theorem demonstrates that in inﬁnitely repeatedgames with sufﬁciently patient players, essentially any individuallyrational and feasible outcome can be sustained as an equilibrium.
More speciﬁcally, the Folk Theorem shows that when:
1.Players interact repeatedly with no known endpoint (inﬁnite
horizon)
2.Players value future payoffs sufﬁciently (have a high enoughdiscount factor )
3.Players can observe each other's past actions (perfect monitoring)
Then cooperation can emerge as an equilibrium strategy, sustained bythe threat of future punishment or the promise of future rewards. Thisoccurs even in games like the Prisoner's Dilemma where non-cooperation is the equilibrium strategy in one-shot interactions.
9.2. 9.2. 6.2 From Folk Theorem to Agency Protocol 6.2 From Folk Theorem to Agency Protocol
While the Folk Theorem establishes the theoretical possibility ofcooperation, it relies on conditions that are often absent in digitalenvironments:
1.Persistent IdentitiesPersistent Identities : Online, identities can be created and
discarded easily
2.Perfect MonitoringPerfect Monitoring : Observing past behavior across contexts is
difﬁcult
3.Inﬁnite HorizonInﬁnite Horizon : Many digital interactions lack expectation of
ongoing engagement
4.Sufﬁcient PatienceSufﬁcient Patience : Digital contexts often emphasize immediate
outcomes
The Agency Protocol represents an architectural implementation of theFolk Theorem's conditions, deliberately creating an environment wherecooperation can emerge as the rational strategy. It does this by:
1.Creating Persistent IdentitiesCreating Persistent Identities : Through cryptographically
veriﬁable, content-addressed identities
2.Enabling MonitoringEnabling Monitoring : Through immutable record-keeping of
promises and assessments
3.Importing Future Value into Present DecisionsImporting Future Value into Present Decisions : Through stake

9.3. 9.3. 6.3 Beyond the Folk Theorem 6.3 Beyond the Folk Theorem
What our analysis demonstrates is that the Agency Protocol doesn't
merely implement the Folk Theorem's conditions—it extends them inseveral important ways:
1.Finite Horizon ApplicabilityFinite Horizon Applicability : Unlike the Folk Theorem, our
analysis shows that cooperation can emerge as an equilibriumstrategy even without assuming inﬁnite repetition. The stake-based mechanism creates immediate consequences that don't relysolely on future interactions.
2.Domain-Speciﬁc ReputationDomain-Speciﬁc Reputation : The Folk Theorem considers
reputation as a single dimension, while our analysis accounts fordomain-speciﬁc merit that more accurately reﬂects real-worldtrust patterns.
3.Progressive Stake RequirementsProgressive Stake Requirements : The Agency Protocol creates a
positive feedback loop where cooperation becomes increasinglyadvantageous over time, rather than maintaining a staticequilibrium.
4.Recovery GuaranteesRecovery Guarantees : Our analysis provides explicit bounds on
how quickly the system recovers from perturbations (Corollary 9.1),going beyond the Folk Theorem's equilibrium properties to addressdynamic stability.
5.Coalition ResistanceCoalition Resistance : The proof demonstrates resistance to
coordinated manipulation (Theorems 5-7), addressing attackvectors not considered in the original Folk Theorem.
9.4. 9.4. 6.4 The Folk Theorem's Legacy in Our Analysis 6.4 The Folk Theorem's Legacy in Our Analysis
Despite these extensions, our analysis builds directly on the FolkTheorem's fundamental insight: that rational agents can cooperatewithout external enforcement when future interactions are structuredappropriately. Key connections include:
1.Discount Factor ThresholdDiscount Factor Threshold : Theorem 4 establishes a minimum
discount factor  above which cooperation becomes anequilibrium strategy, directly paralleling the Folk Theorem'spatience requirement.
2.Subgame PerfectionSubgame Perfection : Our analysis demonstrates conditions
under which the cooperative equilibrium is subgame perfect(Theorem 4), a concept central to reﬁnements of the Folk Theorem.
3.Punishment CredibilityPunishment Credibility : The off-path analysis in Theorem 4
examines the credibility of punishment strategies, a criticalelement in Folk Theorem analysis.
These connections highlight how the Agency Protocol translatesabstract game-theoretic principles into concrete, implementablemechanisms, while extending their applicability beyond the originalconstraints of the Folk Theorem.
9.5. 9.5. 6.5 Implications for Mechanism Design 6.5 Implications for Mechanism Design
By implementing and extending the Folk Theorem, our analysiscontributes to mechanism design theory in several ways:
1.Architectural CooperationArchitectural Cooperation : It demonstrates how systems can be
designed to structurally favor cooperation without requiringexternal enforcement.
2.Incentive AlignmentIncentive Alignment : It shows how self-interest can be aligned
with collective welfare through carefully designed reward andpunishment mechanisms.
3.Stability EngineeringStability Engineering : It provides a framework for creating
systems that not only achieve cooperative equilibria but maintainthem in the face of perturbations.
These contributions extend beyond the Agency Protocol itself, offeringinsights for designing cooperative systems in any context where trustand coordination are essential.
10. 10. Bounded RationalityBounded Rationality
Real-world agents deviate from perfect rationality due to cognitivelimitations, incomplete information, and occasional errors. This sectionanalyzes how the Agency Protocol's equilibrium properties withstandthese deviations, demonstrating that honest behavior remains theoptimal strategy under realistic conditions.
We model bounded rationality through three complementary
frameworks:

The expected utility under this stochastic model is:
where  is the utility from best response and  is the expected
utility from random choice.

Proof:* Proof:*  The expected utility difference between keeping and breaking
promises under bounded rationality is:
For cooperation to remain the preferred strategy, this difference must
be positive. Since

we obtain:Solving for  yields the result. ∎
Corollary 10.1*Corollary 10.1*  (System-Level Error Tolerance): In a system with 
agents, if each agent's error rate , the proportion of broken
promises remains below  (the consensus threshold from Theorem 5).
This demonstrates that random errors do not cascade into systematic
defection.

Theorem 11*Theorem 11*  (Finite Horizon Cooperation): The cooperative equilibrium
persists with agents having ﬁnite lookahead horizon  if:
Proof:* Proof:*  For cooperation to remain optimal with -period lookahead,
the discounted future beneﬁts within horizon  must exceed the one-
time gain from defection:
Evaluating the geometric series and solving for  yields the result. ∎
For typical Protocol parameters ( , , ,

This means agents need only consider approximately 4 future periods to
maintain cooperative behavior, demonstrating that the Protocol doesn'trequire unrealistic cognitive capabilities.

11.1. 11.1. 7.1 Cycle Detection and Prevention 7.1 Cycle Detection and Prevention
One critical practical challenge in implementing trust systems ispreventing circular dependencies that could create logical or economicinconsistencies. The Agency Protocol's implementation addresses thisthrough specialized cycle detection mechanisms for three key areas:
1.Inheritance CyclesInheritance Cycles : The protocol prevents circular inheritance
relationships that could create logical paradoxes:
When Agent C attempts to inherit from Agent A, the Cycle Detectoridentiﬁes the cycle involving Agent A, Agent B, and Agent C, and theinheritance assignment is rejected.
1.Credit Transfer CyclesCredit Transfer Cycles : The protocol identiﬁes and prevents
circular credit ﬂows that could create economic inconsistencies:
1.Merit Dependency CyclesMerit Dependency Cycles : The protocol prevents circular
assessment relationships that could create evaluation paradoxes:
This implementation of cycle detection addresses a crucial edge case inreputation systems and ensures the logical and economic consistencyof the protocol.
11.2. 11.2. 7.2 Cold Start Problem  7.2 Cold Start Problem
A persistent challenge in reputation systems is bootstrapping initialtrust. The Agency Protocol addresses this through a multi-facetedapproach:
1.Initial Credit AllocationInitial Credit Allocation : New users receive 20 free credits with
a 30-day expiration period, allowing them to make initial promiseswithout prior reputation.
2.Vouching MechanismVouching Mechanism : Established agents can vouch for new
agents, sharing both the beneﬁts and risks of the newcomer'sperformance:
1.Progressive Evidence RequirementsProgressive Evidence Requirements : Lower-merit agents face
stronger evidence requirements until they establish credibility:
Table 2: Progressive Evidence Requirements
Merit RangeMerit Range Evidence RequirementsEvidence Requirements

This comprehensive approach to the cold start problem enables new
agents to enter the system while maintaining appropriate safeguardsagainst exploitation.

Another practical challenge involves ensuring fair and manipulation-resistant processing of assessments, especially in environments wheretiming attacks could be attempted. The Agency Protocol implementsmulti-layered batch processing controls:

These controls address potential batch processing anomalies and

11.4. 11.4. 7.4 Decision-Making Failure Modes  7.4 Decision-Making Failure Modes
The Agency Protocol also addresses common decision-making failuresthrough its integrated governance mechanisms. The implementationcombines three complementary agents to handle different failurescenarios:
1.Consensus AgentConsensus Agent : Addresses issues like false consensus and last-
minute objection syndrome through structured contributionprocesses.
2.Meritocratic AgentMeritocratic Agent : Prevents expert blindness and information
bottlenecks by weighting input based on domain-speciﬁcexpertise.
3.Democratic AgentDemocratic Agent : Counteracts tyranny of the majority and
enables conﬂict resolution through voting mechanisms.
These agents work together to handle various edge cases:
This integration of decision mechanisms ensures the system can handlecomplex governance edge cases while maintaining stability and fairness.
11.5. 11.5. 7.5 Domain Boundary Disputes  7.5 Domain Boundary Disputes
A subtle but important edge case involves promises that span multipledomains or have ambiguous classiﬁcation. The Protocol addresses thisthrough multi-domain assessment mechanisms:
1.Cross-Domain AssessmentCross-Domain Assessment : When a promise involves multiple
domains, separate merit calculations occur for each relevantdomain:
1.Domain InheritanceDomain Inheritance : Related domains form inheritance
relationships that allow merit to inﬂuence connected areas whilemaintaining domain separation:
1.Domain DiscoveryDomain Discovery : The system enables merit-based discovery
within domain hierarchies, ensuring appropriate expertise issurfaced for relevant promises.
This approach to domain boundaries ensures the system can handlecomplex, multi-domain promises while maintaining appropriatecontext-speciﬁc trust signals.
12. 12. Conclusion and ImplicationsConclusion and Implications
The Agency Protocol represents a principled, economically robustsolution to fostering cooperation and truthfulness in decentralized,multi-agent environments. Its key contributions include:
Unique Coalition-Proof EquilibriumUnique Coalition-Proof Equilibrium : Promise-keeping emerges
as the sole subgame perfect Nash equilibrium under realisticparameterizations. The exponential cost structure inherentlyprevents stable dishonest coalitions, ensuring robust and uniquelypredictable cooperative outcomes.
Robust Resistance to ManipulationRobust Resistance to Manipulation : Explicit cost structures and
detection mechanisms guarantee increasing resistance againstmanipulation and coalition formation, providing inherent securityand reliability.
Dynamic Stability and Practical ConvergenceDynamic Stability and Practical Convergence : Formal proofs
of Lyapunov stability and rapid convergence propertiesdemonstrate the system's resilience and practical robustnessagainst deviations, ensuring long-term cooperation.
The Agency Protocol thus bridges theory and practice, convertingtheoretical equilibrium conditions into realistic, implementable trustinfrastructures. By aligning individual self-interest with collectivehonesty, it sets a new standard for reliable cooperation in decentralizedecosystems, signiﬁcantly advancing beyond existing trust solutions.

A central innovation in the Agency Protocol's implementation is the useof matrix factorization to identify latent patterns in assessment data.This technique becomes particularly valuable in detecting andneutralizing coordinated manipulation attempts.

We represent assessments as a matrix  where each entry represents agent $is assessment of promise . Through matrixfactorization, we decompose this into:

 is a matrix of promise factors
Each factor represents a latent dimension in the assessment space
In particular, we identify the "common ground" dimension—the factorδmin

and Blockchain Comparisonand Blockchain Comparison
Here we examine the trade-offs between the robust enforcement ofpromise-keeping via blockchain–based mechanisms and the associatedcomputational overhead. We show that while smart contracts canenforce complex commitment schemes (as in our Agency Protocol), thecomputational and communication costs of on-chain veriﬁcation andconsensus are non-negligible. We further relate these costs toestablished complexity results.
17.1. 17.1. Blockchain Enforcement and Computational Cost Blockchain Enforcement and Computational Cost
Smart contracts, as deployed on platforms like Ethereum, requireevery transaction to be veriﬁed by a distributed consensusalgorithm.
Each state change incurs gas fees and time delays, particularlywhen complex mechanisms (e.g. multi-dimensional feedback orextensive message spaces) are used.
This cost scales with the complexity of the contract's logic and thesize of the message space, limiting scalability and real-timeresponsiveness.
17.2. 17.2. Complexity-Theoretic Perspective  Complexity-Theoretic Perspective
We can model the enforcement of our mechanism as acomputational problem whose solution requires verifying asubgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of a sequential game.
Prior work shows that computing an SPNE in certain settings(especially with multiple interacting contracts or in games withimperfect information) is PSPACE-hard. In some cases, withadditional contracts, the problem may even be -hard.
This theoretical result implies that any protocol enforcing theseequilibria on-chain will have a non-polynomial computational costin the worst-case scenario.
17.3. 17.3. Proving the Overhead from Complexity  Proving the Overhead from Complexity
By reducing the veriﬁcation process of the mechanism to a knownhard problem (e.g., checking for an SPNE in an extensive formgame), we can use standard reductions from complexity theory toprove that the on-chain enforcement mechanism has signiﬁcantcomputational requirements.
This means that even if the mechanism is “expressive” enough tocapture nuanced promise-keeping (via multi-dimensional feedbacksignals), the computational cost to implement and verify this on apublic blockchain will be high.
In contrast, if the same enforcement were done off-chain or vialighter centralized protocols, one could achieve similar incentivecompatibility with lower computational overhead.
17.4. 17.4. Discussion and Implications  Discussion and Implications
Although the Agency Protocol’s enriched feedback space allows forrobust promise-keeping (and potentially stronger enforcementagainst collusion), the computational cost on blockchain systemsmay be prohibitive.
This section supports the claim that, while technically achievablethrough blockchain, such mechanisms come with inherentcomplexity issues that impact scalability.
The analysis motivates further work on off-chain computation andhybrid approaches that can maintain rich expressiveness whilereducing the blockchain’s computational burden.

1. 1. Abstract Abstract
Agency Protocol (AP) introduces a decentralized framework for
establishing and verifying domain-speciﬁc trust through explicitpromises and assessments. Unlike traditional reputation systems thataggregate feedback into simpliﬁed scores, AP enables granularcredibility signals tied to speciﬁc domains of expertise or activity. Byformalizing intentions, promises, and assessments—and by enforcing"skin in the game" through stake requirements—AP creates economicconditions where honest behavior emerges as the unique Nashequilibrium strategy for rational agents.
This whitepaper presents the theoretical foundations and practical
implementation of the Agency Protocol. We demonstrate how domain-speciﬁc merit, coupled with cryptographically veriﬁable promises andeconomic incentives, addresses fundamental limitations in existingtrust systems. Through mathematical analysis and game theoreticalmodeling, we establish that AP creates a novel trust environment wherekeeping promises becomes the default strategy for the self-interested—not through external enforcement but through aligned incentives andveriﬁable outcomes.
The paper introduces concrete implementation pathways, from initial
bootstrap mechanisms to sophisticated merit and credit systems thatevolve toward collective intelligence. We also present Agency Process, apractical implementation that helps users achieve their goals throughexpert-assisted sessions guided by merit-based discovery. By enablingmore precise, veriﬁable, and contextual trust signals, the AgencyProtocol offers a path toward more efﬁcient, transparent, and equitablecoordination in complex social systems.
2. 2. IntroductionIntroduction
2.1. 2.1. The Trust Problem in Modern Digital Systems The Trust Problem in Modern Digital Systems
Trust has always been the invisible infrastructure of humancooperation. From the earliest trades between prehistoric tribes totoday's global digital marketplaces, our ability to work together hingeson one fundamental question: Can I trust you to do what you say?
Yet trust doesn't scale easily. In small communities, reputation works
naturally—if you break your promises, everyone knows. But in ourincreasingly complex, globalized world, direct knowledge of others'reliability has been replaced by proxy systems that often fail us in subtlebut profound ways.
Consider the restaurant with hundreds of ﬁve-star reviews that serves
you a disappointing meal, or the highly-rated service provider whorepeatedly misses deadlines. These experiences aren't anomalies—theyreﬂect structural problems in how we currently quantify andcommunicate trustworthiness. When we collapse complex, domain-speciﬁc reliability into simpliﬁed metrics, we lose critical informationand create perverse incentives.
This information gap doesn't just inconvenience individuals—it creates
economic inefﬁciencies on a massive scale. Markets with highinformation asymmetry often suffer from adverse selection, where low-quality providers drive out high-quality ones because consumers can'treliably distinguish between them. The result is a race to the bottomwhere honesty is penalized and manipulation rewarded.
2.2. 2.2. Limitations of Current Approaches Limitations of Current Approaches
Current approaches to establishing trust online fall into three broadcategories, each with signiﬁcant limitations:
2.2.1. 2.2.1. Centralized Authorities  Centralized Authorities
These rely on platform operators or institutions to verify and enforce
trustworthiness. While effective within their domains, these systemscreate single points of failure, vulnerability to capture and corruption,and often lack transparency.
Consider how social media platforms can arbitrarily change veriﬁcation
standards, or how credit rating agencies famously failed during the2008 ﬁnancial crisis by assigning AAA ratings to fundamentally unsoundinstruments. When trust depends on a central authority, that authoritybecomes both a bottleneck and a vulnerability.
2.2.2. 2.2.2. Traditional Reputation Systems  Traditional Reputation Systems
These aggregate user feedback into simpliﬁed metrics like star ratings
or numerical scores. These systems suffer from three critical ﬂaws:
1.One-dimensionalityOne-dimensionality : By collapsing diverse attributes into single
scores, they obscure crucial context. A surgeon might haveexcellent bedside manner but poor surgical outcomes—averagingthese into a single rating actively misleads patients.
2.Gaming vulnerabilityGaming vulnerability : Without skin in the game, these systems
are easily manipulated through fake reviews, review bombing, orstrategic timing of feedback requests.
3.Feedback dilutionFeedback dilution : Most users only leave feedback when
extremely satisﬁed or dissatisﬁed, creating a bimodal distributionthat fails to capture the nuanced middle.
2.2.3. 2.2.3. Blockchain and Decentralized Alternatives  Blockchain and Decentralized Alternatives
These address some issues of centralization but often focus narrowly onﬁnancial transactions or tokenized reputation that lacks domainspeciﬁcity. Many implement "trustless" systems that eliminate the needfor trust in certain narrow contexts but don't fundamentally solve thebroader trust problem across domains.
For instance, blockchain systems can verify that a transaction occurred
but can't tell you whether the service delivered was high quality. NFTmarketplaces can conﬁrm ownership but offer no insight into artisticmerit or investment value. The technology solves one part of the trustequation while leaving other crucial aspects unaddressed.
These limitations reveal a fundamental gap: we lack a generalizable, generalizable,
decentralized trust system that can evaluate credibility acrossdecentralized trust system that can evaluate credibility across
arbitrary domains using both *veriﬁable actions and *domain-arbitrary domains using both *veriﬁable actions and *domain-
speciﬁc meritspeciﬁc merit .
2.3. 2.3. A New Paradigm: Promise-Based Agency A New Paradigm: Promise-Based Agency
The Agency Protocol proposes a fundamentally different approach to
trust—one built on explicit promises, domain-speciﬁc assessments, andskin in the game for all participants. Rather than abstracting away themessy details of human reliability into simpliﬁed metrics, AP embracescomplexity by creating a structured framework for capturing andcommunicating trustworthiness in context.
At its core, AP introduces several key innovations:
Explicit PromisesExplicit Promises : Agents make clear, veriﬁable commitments
about speciﬁc actions or outcomes, replacing vague implicit
expectations with precise, assessable statements.
Domain-Speciﬁc MeritDomain-Speciﬁc Merit : Trustworthiness is tracked within
speciﬁc domains, preventing reputation laundering and ensuringthat merit reﬂects genuine capability in context.
Skin in the GameSkin in the Game : Both promise-makers and assessors stake
resources on their claims, creating meaningful consequences fordishonesty.
Cryptographic VeriﬁcationCryptographic Veriﬁcation : Promises and assessments are
cryptographically signed, creating an immutable, non-repudiablerecord of commitments and outcomes.
Evolutionarily Stable IncentivesEvolutionarily Stable Incentives : The system creates conditions
where honest behavior emerges as the Nash equilibrium strategyfor rational agents.
These elements combine to create what we might call a "high-ﬁdelitytrust protocol"—a system that preserves the rich contextual nature oftrustworthiness while enabling efﬁcient veriﬁcation and transfer oftrust signals.
2.4. 2.4. The Evolution of Agency The Evolution of Agency
The Agency Protocol draws inspiration from evolutionary systems,where adaptation and selection pressures create increasingly ﬁtsolutions over time. Just as natural selection has produced remarkablyeffective cooperation strategies in biological systems, AP creates anenvironment where trustworthy behavior is naturally selected for.
This evolutionary perspective extends beyond individual agents to the
protocol itself. As we'll explore in this paper, both the merit and creditsystems undergo staged evolution from simple calculations tosophisticated collective intelligence mechanisms. The protocol'simplementation strategy mirrors the gradual complexity increases weobserve in natural systems.

3. 3. Core Concepts & Theoretical FoundationsCore Concepts & Theoretical Foundations
The Agency Protocol builds on several foundational concepts thattogether create a novel approach to establishing and verifying trust indigital systems. These concepts aren't merely technical speciﬁcations—they represent a fundamental rethinking of how we signal, measure,and propagate trustworthiness across complex networks of human andmachine agents.
3.1. 3.1. Promise Theory: From Implicit to Explicit Promise Theory: From Implicit to Explicit
CommitmentsCommitments
At the heart of Agency Protocol lies Promise Theory, a mathematicalframework developed by computer scientist Mark Burgess thatformalizes how autonomous agents interact through voluntarycommitments. Unlike traditional models that impose rules from outside,Promise Theory builds systems from the bottom up, analyzing howbehaviors emerge when individual agents make and assess explicitpromises.
Promise Theory shifts our focus from assumed trust assumed trust  (relying on
authority or reputation) to earned trust earned trust  (built through veriﬁable
actions). In most online environments, promises remain implicit—a
restaurant implicitly promises good food, a freelancer implicitlypromises competent work—with no formal accountability mechanism.Agency Protocol transforms this dynamic by making promises explicit,assessable, and consequential. In the Agency Protocol, promises haveseveral critical properties:
1.ExplicitnessExplicitness : Promises clearly state what will be delivered, under
what conditions, and by when.
2.AutonomyAutonomy : Agents freely choose which promises to make,
reﬂecting their genuine capabilities.
3.Non-repudiationNon-repudiation : Cryptographic signatures ensure promises
cannot be denied later.
4.AssessabilityAssessability : Each promise can be evaluated as kept or broken
based on evidence.
5.ConsequencesConsequences : Broken promises affect both reputation (merit)
and resources (staked credits).
This approach transforms digital trust from a nebulous concept into atangible, veriﬁable property emerging from speciﬁc commitments.
3.2. 3.2. The Merit Paradigm: Beyond Reputation The Merit Paradigm: Beyond Reputation
In the Agency Protocol, merit merit  represents a fundamentally different
concept than traditional reputation. While reputation suggestssubjective perception perception , merit implies objectively demonstrable value value
based on a traceable history of fulﬁlled promises.
3.2.1. 3.2.1. Why Merit, Not Reputation?  Why Merit, Not Reputation?
The word "merit" conveys a stronger and more precise meaning than
"reputation." Consider how we use these terms in everyday language:
"That argument has merit" means it has inherent value regardlessof who made it.
"She has a good reputation" suggests others perceive her positively,but without specifying why.
Merit is earned through demonstrable actions, while reputation can beinﬂuenced by irrelevant factors like charisma, social status, ormarketing. This distinction becomes crucial in digital systems where welack the rich contextual understanding that helps humans interpretreputation in nuanced ways.
3.2.2. 3.2.2. Context-Speciﬁcity: The Domain Advantage  Context-Speciﬁcity: The Domain Advantage
Perhaps the most powerful aspect of merit in the Agency Protocol is its
domain-speciﬁcity. Unlike one-dimensional reputation systems, meritexists within speciﬁc namespaces, preventing what we might call"reputation laundering"—using success in one area to mask failures inanother.
Consider a hypothetical case study:>Dr. M is a surgeon known for her kind bedside manner, leavingDr. M is a surgeon known for her kind bedside manner, leaving
patients at ease during consultations. However, her surgicalpatients at ease during consultations. However, her surgical
performance has declined due to personal struggles. Mostperformance has declined due to personal struggles. Most
patient reviews reﬂect her personality, not her surgicalpatient reviews reﬂect her personality, not her surgical
outcomes. As a result, her general reputation remains positiveoutcomes. As a result, her general reputation remains positive
while concerning performance patterns go unnoticed.while concerning performance patterns go unnoticed.
This example highlights how traditional reputation systems fail when
they collapse unrelated attributes into a single score. In the AgencyProtocol, Dr. M would have separate merit scores for "bedside manner"and "surgical outcomes," preventing high scores in one domain frommasking problems in another.
Domain-speciﬁc merit creates several powerful advantages:
1.Precision Precision : Merit reﬂects speciﬁc capabilities rather than general
impressions.
2.Resistance to gamingResistance to gaming : Manipulating merit requires actually
keeping promises in the relevant domain.
3.Informational richnessInformational richness : Users can evaluate merit in exactly the
domains they care about.
4.Network effectsNetwork effects : As the system grows, merit becomes an
increasingly powerful predictor of future behavior.
This approach aligns with how humans naturally think about expertise.
We intuitively understand that someone can be brilliant in one domainwhile average in another. Merit in the Agency Protocol captures thisnuance that ﬂat reputation systems miss.

3.3.1. 3.3.1. Context and Motivation  Context and Motivation
Adaptive dynamics in game theory rarely converge to Nash equilibria ingeneral settings, posing a signiﬁcant challenge for predicting stableoutcomes in many real-world scenarios. While convergence has beenestablished for special cases like zero-sum and potential games, generalconvergence remains an open problem.
Agency Protocol (AP), with its merit-weighted assessment structure and
stake-based incentives, suggests a promising approach to this challengeby introducing mechanisms that may improve convergence properties.
3.3.2. 3.3.2. Hypothesis and Supporting Evidence  Hypothesis and Supporting Evidence
We propose that under certain conditions, AP's adaptive dynamics may
exhibit improved convergence properties compared to traditionaldynamics:
1.Merit-Weighted LearningMerit-Weighted Learning : By using historical reliability (merit)
to weight strategy updates, agents' learning paths may avoidcycling behaviors that prevent convergence in standard models.
2.Bounded Rationality FrameworkBounded Rationality Framework : AP's incremental merit
updates and stake recalculations naturally implement a form ofbounded rationality that has shown better convergence propertiesin simulation studies.
3.Potential Lyapunov CandidatePotential Lyapunov Candidate : The cumulative "unfulﬁlled
promise cost" in AP appears to serve as a non-increasing functionduring typical agent interactions, suggesting a possible stabilitymechanism.
4.Stake-Based Incentive AlignmentStake-Based Incentive Alignment : The economic penalties for
deviation may create basins of attraction around honest strategiesthat could facilitate convergence.

Initial computational experiments with AP dynamics show promisingconvergence properties in several game classes that traditionallyexhibit cycling or non-convergence. While these results do notconstitute a general proof, they suggest that AP's mechanisms maymitigate some fundamental obstacles to convergence.
Further research is needed to formalize these observations into
rigorous mathematical results, but the initial ﬁndings suggest that AP'sapproach may contribute valuable insights to the ongoing study ofconvergence in adaptive dynamics.

The classic Folk Theorem for repeated games faces signiﬁcant
challenges in imperfect monitoring scenarios—where players receivenoisy or incomplete signals about others' actions. Characterizingequilibria under these conditions remains an active area of researchwith important boundary cases still unresolved.
Agency Protocol's probabilistic evidence framework offers a practical
approach to working within these theoretical constraints.
3.4.2. 3.4.2. Framework Correspondence  Framework Correspondence
We observe an important structural correspondence between
traditional imperfect monitoring signals and AP's probabilistic evidence:
1.Formal MappingFormal Mapping : Traditional imperfect monitoring, where players
receive signals  correlated with actions  according to

is assessed via probabilistic evidence following the sameconditional distribution.
2.Payoff StructurePayoff Structure : The expected utility calculations in traditional

2.Merit-Weighted SignalsMerit-Weighted Signals : By weighting assessments based on
assessor merit, AP provides a natural approach to managing signalquality.
3.Stake-Based CommitmentStake-Based Commitment : The economic stakes in AP create

While this framework doesn't resolve all theoretical questions aboutequilibria under imperfect monitoring, it offers a practicalimplementation approach that accommodates these challengingscenarios. Our work contributes to bridging the gap betweentheoretical game models and practical mechanisms for managing trustunder uncertainty.
3.5. 3.5. Evidence: Veriﬁability in Trust Evidence: Veriﬁability in Trust
While merit represents the historical record of kept promises,evidence evidence  provides the concrete proof upon which assessments are
based. The Agency Protocol supports multiple forms of evidence toaccommodate various promise types and veriﬁcation needs.
3.5.1. 3.5.1. Types of Evidence  Types of Evidence
The protocol recognizes a spectrum of evidence requirements:
1.Experience-Based AssessmentsExperience-Based Assessments : Most promises are evaluated
based on direct user experience, requiring no formal evidence
beyond the assessor's judgment. For example, a restaurant'spromise of "authentic Italian taste" is primarily assessed throughcustomer experience.
2.Automatic EvidenceAutomatic Evidence : System-generated data like timestamps,
GPS coordinates, or sensor readings can provide objectiveveriﬁcation for certain promises. A delivery service's promise of"delivery within 45 minutes" can be automatically veriﬁed throughorder and delivery timestamps.
3.Validated EvidenceValidated Evidence : Some promises require tangible
documentation (images, certiﬁcates, receipts) veriﬁed by humanvalidators with domain expertise. A vendor promising "freshingredients delivered daily" might submit supplier receipts andphotos that require expert validation.
4.Progressive EvidenceProgressive Evidence : The protocol implements dynamic
evidence requirements based on agent merit. New agents withlimited domain merit face stricter evidence requirements thanestablished agents with proven track records.
This ﬂexible approach ensures that evidence requirements match thecontext and importance of each promise. Simple dining experiencesdon't need elaborate documentation, while medical treatments mightrequire comprehensive evidence packages.
The system also accounts for evidence quality in merit calculations.
High-quality, timely evidence leads to stronger positive merit impacts,while delayed or questionable evidence reduces positive outcomes.
4. 4. Technical ArchitectureTechnical Architecture
The theoretical foundations of the Agency Protocol require a robusttechnical architecture to bring them to life. This section explores thecomputational and cryptographic infrastructure that enables veriﬁablepromises, secure assessments, and reliable merit calculation at scale.
4.1. 4.1. Content-Addressed Storage: The Foundation of Content-Addressed Storage: The Foundation of
VeriﬁabilityVeriﬁability
At the architectural core of the Agency Protocol lies content-addressedstorage—a paradigm where data is referenced not by arbitraryidentiﬁers but by addresses derived from the content itself. This simpleyet powerful concept underpins the entire system's veriﬁability.
4.1.1. 4.1.1. How Content Addressing Works  How Content Addressing Works
When an agent creates a promise, assessment, or any other data
structure in the system, the protocol:
1.Serializes the complete data structure into a standard format
2.Applies a cryptographic hash function (typically SHA-256) to thisserialized data
3.Uses the resulting hash as the object's unique address
This creates a one-to-one mapping between content and addresses.The same content will always generate the same address, while even asingle-bit change produces an entirely different address.
4.1.2. 4.1.2. Properties of Content-Addressed Systems  Properties of Content-Addressed Systems
Content addressing provides several critical properties to the Agency
Protocol:
1.Integrity Veriﬁcation
Any agent can independently verify that retrieved data matches its
address by rehashing the content and comparing it to the claimedaddress. This eliminates the need to trust storage providers ortransmission channels.
2.Immutability
Content-addressed data is inherently immutable—any modiﬁcation
would change the address. This immutability ensures that promisesand assessments cannot be retroactively altered.
3.Deduplication
Identical data automatically receives identical addresses, creating
natural deduplication. This improves storage efﬁciency andsimpliﬁes reference tracking.
4.Location Independence
Content-addressed data can be retrieved from any storage
provider that has a copy, enabling resilient distributed storagewithout complex coordination.
4.2. 4.2. Agent Creation and Lifecycle Agent Creation and Lifecycle
Within this content-addressed architecture, agents represent theautonomous entities making and assessing promises. The protocoldeﬁnes clear processes for agent creation, evolution, and retirement.
4.2.1. 4.2.1. Agent Creation  Agent Creation
The lifecycle begins with agent creation:
1.An entity generates a cryptographic key pair (public and private
keys)
2.They create an initial agent state containing their public key
3.They sign this state with their private key
4.The signed state receives a content-based address
5.This address becomes the agent's initial identiﬁer
This self-sovereign identity approach allows agents to join the systemwithout requiring central approval or registration. The agent's identityemerges directly from their cryptographic capabilities.
4.2.2. 4.2.2. Agent Evolution  Agent Evolution
As agents make promises, receive assessments, and build merit, they
need to update their state. The protocol handles this through a linked-state model:
1.The agent creates a new state object containing updatedinformation
2.This new state includes a reference to the previous state's address
3.The agent signs the new state with their private key
4.The signed state receives a new content-based address
5.A state transition record links the old and new addresses
This creates a veriﬁable history or "chain of custody" for each agent,allowing others to trace their evolution from genesis to current state.
4.2.3. 4.2.3. State Transition Veriﬁcation  State Transition Veriﬁcation
When an agent updates their state, the system veriﬁes:
1.The signature on the new state matches the public key from the
previous state
2.The previous state reference points to a valid state in the system
3.The state transition follows protocol rules (e.g., merit can't bearbitrarily increased)
This veriﬁcation ensures that only the legitimate controller of anagent's private key can update their state, while maintaining theintegrity of protocol rules.
4.3. 4.3. Promise Creation, Modiﬁcation, and Assessment Promise Creation, Modiﬁcation, and Assessment
Promises form the core operational unit within the Agency Protocol.The technical infrastructure handles their creation, modiﬁcation,assessment, and veriﬁcation.
4.3.1. 4.3.1. Promise Creation  Promise Creation
When an agent makes a promise:
1.They create a promise object containing:
The intention (what they promise to do)
Conditions under which the promise applies (optional)
Timeframe for fulﬁllment (optional)
Any associated stake amount
2.They sign this object with their private key
3.The signed promise receives a content-based address
4.This address is recorded in the agent's state
5.The promise becomes visible to other agents in relevant domains
4.3.2. 4.3.2. Promise Modiﬁcation  Promise Modiﬁcation
Promises themselves are immutable, but agents can effectively modify
them by:
1.Creating a new promise that references the original
2.Explicitly stating the modiﬁcations
3.Signing the new promise
4.Updating their state to reference the new promise instead of theoriginal
This approach preserves the complete history of commitment evolutionwhile allowing necessary adaptations.
4.3.3. 4.3.3. Promise Assessment  Promise Assessment
When an agent assesses another's promise:
1.They create an assessment object containing:
Reference to the promise being assessed
Status determination (KEPT or BROKEN)
Evidence supporting their assessment
Domain in which they're making the assessment
Stake amount (if applicable)
2.They sign this assessment with their private key
3.The signed assessment receives a content-based address
4.The assessment is linked to both the promise and the assessor's
state
This creates a veriﬁable record of who assessed what, when, and basedon what evidence—enabling independent veriﬁcation of all assessmentclaims.
4.4. 4.4. Merit Calculation Mechanics Merit Calculation Mechanics
The protocol's merit system transforms raw promises and assessmentsinto meaningful credibility signals through a sophisticated calculationengine.
4.4.1. 4.4.1. Base Merit Calculation  Base Merit Calculation
At its simplest level, merit calculation follows this process:
1.Identify all promises made by an agent in a speciﬁc domain
2.Gather all assessments for those promises
3.For each assessment:
Verify signature and integrity
Check assessor credentials in the relevant domain
Weight assessment based on assessor merit and stake
Determine temporal relevance (newer assessments count
more)
4.Aggregate weighted assessments to determine promise status
5.Calculate domain merit based on promise fulﬁllment history
6.Apply time decay to reﬂect current relevance
This calculation happens within the context of batch processing toprotect privacy and improve efﬁciency.
4.4.2. 4.4.2. Multi-Stage Merit Evolution  Multi-Stage Merit Evolution
As described in the Implementation Roadmap, merit calculation evolves
through distinct stages of increasing sophistication. The technicalarchitecture supports this evolution through:
1.Modular calculation components that can be upgradedindependently
2.Flexible weighting mechanisms for different factors
3.Pluggable algorithms for matrix factorization and patternrecognition
4.Conﬁgurable batch processing parameters
This design allows the protocol to start with simple calculations thatprovide immediate value while establishing foundations for moresophisticated approaches.
4.4.3. 4.4.3. Mathematical Foundations  Mathematical Foundations
The merit calculation engine draws on several mathematical disciplines:
1.Graph Theory
Promise and assessment relationships form a directed graph that
can be analyzed for patterns, clusters, and anomalies.
2.Matrix Factorization
Advanced merit calculations use techniques from recommendation
systems to identify underlying patterns in assessment data.
3.Bayesian Statistics
The system employs Bayesian methods to update merit
probabilities as new evidence emerges.
4.Information Theory
Entropy measurements help identify domains where assessments
contain the most information value.
These mathematical foundations ensure that merit calculations
remain rigorous and defensible even as they grow in complexity.
4.5. 4.5. Batch Processing and Inference Control Batch Processing and Inference Control
A key innovation in the Agency Protocol is its batch processing system,which enhances privacy while maintaining veriﬁability.
4.5.1. 4.5.1. The Privacy-Transparency Tradeoff  The Privacy-Transparency Tradeoff
Individual assessments create privacy challenges—when everyone can
see exactly who assessed what and how, strategic or retaliatorybehavior becomes possible. Yet complete opacity would undermine thesystem's veriﬁability.
Batch processing navigates this tradeoff by:
1.Grouping related assessments together
2.Processing them in scheduled batches rather than immediately
3.Publishing aggregate results rather than individual contributions
4.Preserving cryptographic veriﬁability of the process
4.5.2. 4.5.2. Batch Timing Control  Batch Timing Control
The protocol implements several mechanisms to control batch timing:
1.Minimal ControlBasic scheduling with ﬁxed periods, suited for domains with low
privacy requirements.
2.Medium Control
Dynamic timing based on minimum sample sizes and random
delays, obscuring the connection between individual assessmentsand merit updates.
3.Strong Control
Variable length periods with randomized processing windows,
making timing analysis extremely difﬁcult.
4.Maximum Control
Large ﬁxed periods with cross-domain mixing and added noise,
providing maximum privacy protection.
4.5.3. 4.5.3. Anonymity Set Control  Anonymity Set Control
Complementing batch timing, anonymity set controls ensure thatassessments can't be attributed to speciﬁc assessors:
1.Minimal Anonymity
Basic batching requires multiple assessments per update and
prevents singleton patterns.
2.Medium Anonymity
Larger set sizes with distribution requirements ensure diversity of
both assessors and targets.
3.Strong Anonymity
Enforces k-anonymity principles where any inference attempt
encounters at least k possible sources.
4.Maximum Anonymity
Requires huge assessment sets with full domain mixing and
minimum thresholds, making individual attribution statisticallyimpossible.
4.5.4. 4.5.4. Update Granularity Control  Update Granularity Control
The ﬁnal privacy layer controls how clearly merit changes can beconnected to speciﬁc batches:
1.Minimal Granularity
Continuous small updates provide maximum transparency but
minimal privacy.
2.Medium Granularity
Quantized updates with minimum change thresholds obscure small
contributions.
3.Strong Granularity
Large step functions with delay mechanisms signiﬁcantly reduce
the correlation between assessments and visible changes.
4.Maximum Granularity
Infrequent major updates with cross-domain mixing create
maximum disconnect between individual actions and observableoutcomes.
4.5.5. 4.5.5. Proof of Process Integrity  Proof of Process Integrity
Despite these privacy protections, the protocol maintains veriﬁabilitythrough:
1.Zero-knowledge proofs that demonstrate calculations followedprotocol rules
2.Aggregate statistics that enable pattern analysis without revealingindividual contributions
3.Cryptographic commitments that allow independent veriﬁcation ofbatch integrity
4.Time-delayed transparency where full details become availableafter sensitivity periods
This "proof of process" approach ensures that while individualcontributions remain private, the overall system integrity remainsveriﬁable.
4.6. 4.6. Credit System Infrastructure Credit System Infrastructure
Complementing the merit system, the protocol's credit system providesthe economic foundation for skin-in-the-game mechanisms. Thetechnical infrastructure supports credit issuance, staking, transfer, andrecovery.
4.6.1. 4.6.1. Credit Issuance and Distribution  Credit Issuance and Distribution
The protocol controls credit supply through:
1.Initial allocation mechanisms for new agents
2.Reward formulas for valuable contributions
3.Stake-based rewards for honest assessments
4.Systematic recapture of forfeited stakes
These mechanisms ensure sufﬁcient credit liquidity while preventing
inﬂation.
4.6.2. 4.6.2. Stake Management  Stake Management
The staking infrastructure handles:
1.Credit locking when promises or assessments are made
2.Veriﬁcation of stake adequacy against requirements
3.Dynamic stake adjustment based on merit
4.Stake return or forfeiture based on outcomes
4.6.3. 4.6.3. Credit Transfer Mechanisms  Credit Transfer Mechanisms
The protocol supports direct credit transfers between agents through:
1.Signed transfer authorizations
2.Atomic transaction processing
3.History tracking for all movements
4.Conditional transfers linked to promise fulﬁllment
4.6.4. 4.6.4. Credit Security  Credit Security
To protect the credit system's integrity, the architecture implements:
1.Cryptographic validation of all credit operations
2.Double-entry accounting for balance veriﬁcation
3.Cycle detection to prevent circular transfer exploits
4.Rate limiting to mitigate attack vectors
4.7. 4.7. System Integration and APIs System Integration and APIs
While the core protocol deﬁnes these fundamental mechanisms,
practical implementations require integration capabilities. Thearchitecture provides:
4.7.1. 4.7.1. Standardized APIs  Standardized APIs

Organizations can deploy Agency Protocol internally with:

Public networks can implement Agency Protocol with:
1. Permissionless agent creation
2. Distributed content storage
3. Transparent merit calculation
4. Open credit systems
This approach maximizes resilience and censorship resistance at the
cost of some performance and ﬂexibility.
The architectural ﬂexibility allows for graduated adoption, where
organizations can begin with centralized or federated implementationsand progressively decentralize as the ecosystem matures.

4.11. 4.11. Conclusion: Architecture as Trust Infrastructure  Conclusion: Architecture as Trust Infrastructure
The technical architecture of the Agency Protocol doesn't merelyimplement a speciﬁcation—it creates the infrastructure for afundamentally new approach to digital trust. By combining content-addressed storage, cryptographic veriﬁcation, batch processing, andeconomic mechanisms, it enables the promise-based, domain-speciﬁctrust model described in our theoretical foundations.
This architecture separates implementation from protocol, allowing
diverse technical approaches while maintaining compatibility.Organizations can deploy Agency Protocol in ways that match theirspeciﬁc needs and constraints, while still participating in the broadertrust ecosystem.
In the next section, we'll explore how this technical foundation supports
a robust economic model that aligns incentives for all participants.
5. 5. Economic Model Economic Model
The Agency Protocol's economic model creates a novel incentivelandscape where trust, accountability, and fair exchange naturallyemerge from agent interactions. Unlike many digital economies thatinadvertently reward manipulation and exploitation, AP's economicarchitecture carefully aligns individual interests with collective valuecreation.
5.1. 5.1. Credit System Fundamentals Credit System Fundamentals
At the heart of the Agency Protocol's economic model lies the creditsystem—a transferable value mechanism that creates meaningfulconsequences for promises and assessments.
5.1.1. 5.1.1. Core Principles  Core Principles
The credit system implements four essential principles that drive its
effectiveness:
1. Deterrence of Malicious Behavior
By requiring agents to stake credit on promises and assessments,
the system creates tangible consequences for dishonesty. Thisaddresses the fundamental problem of "cheap talk" that plaguesmany online environments, where claims can be made withoutrepercussion.
When an agent stakes credits on a promise, those credits are
locked until the promise is resolved. If the promise is broken, asigniﬁcant portion of these credits is forfeited. This creates adirect economic disincentive for making promises one cannotkeep.
2. Incentivization of Valuable Contributions
Agents who consistently fulﬁll promises and provide accurate
assessments are rewarded with both increased merit and creditreturns. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of valuableparticipation.
For example, when an agent keeps a promise, they receive their
staked credits back plus a small bonus. Similarly, assessments thatalign with the eventual consensus generate credit rewards. Theserewards scale with the risk taken and the value provided to thesystem.
3. Barrier to Sybil Attacks
The credit requirement creates a progressive economic barrier to
creating multiple fake identities, as each new identity wouldrequire fresh credit allocation and stake building.
This protection is crucial for maintaining the integrity of merit
calculations. Without it, malicious actors could create armies offake identities to artiﬁcially inﬂate or deﬂate merit scores throughcoordinated assessments.
4. Accessibility Through Merit
While staking creates economic barriers, these barriers diminish as
agents build domain-speciﬁc merit. This ensures the systemremains accessible to genuine participants while maintainingrigorous protections.
For agents with high merit in relevant domains, stake requirements
may be reduced by up to 80%, reﬂecting their proven reliability.This creates a virtuous cycle where trustworthy behavior increaseseconomic efﬁciency.
5.1.2. 5.1.2. Initial Credit Allocation  Initial Credit Allocation
The bootstrapping challenge—how new agents enter the system—isaddressed through careful credit allocation mechanisms:
Table 1: Initial Credit Allocation Parameters
ParameterParameter ImplementationImplementation Purpose Purpose
Minimum ViableCreditSufﬁcient for basicoperationsEnablesparticipation
Earning Potential Merit-based reward
functionsCreates growthpath
Credit Caps Limits on initial holdings Prevents hoarding
Fair Access Equitable distribution Prevents capture
New agents receive enough credit to make basic promises andassessments, but not enough to overwhelm the system throughmalicious behavior. This creates a balanced entry point:
This model allows new agents to prove themselves through kept
promises and honest assessments, gradually building both merit andcredit.
5.1.3. 5.1.3. Staking Requirements  Staking Requirements
The credit required to stake on a promise follows a sophisticated
formula that balances several factors:
Where:
base basestake stake : The standard stake for promises in this domain
impact impactmultipliermultiplier : A function of promise scope and potential effect
risk riskfactor factor : A function of promise novelty and uncertainty
merit meritmodiﬁer modiﬁer : A function of the agent's domain-speciﬁc merit
This formula creates several critical properties:
ProportionalityProportionality : Higher-impact promises require larger stakes
Risk CalibrationRisk Calibration : Novel or uncertain promises carry higher
requirements
Merit RecognitionMerit Recognition : Proven agents face lower stake requirements
Domain SensitivityDomain Sensitivity : Requirements adjust based on domain
characteristics
The merit modiﬁer creates a particularly powerful dynamic, as shown in
this progression:
Table 2: Merit-Based Stake Adjustments
Merit Merit
Range RangeMerit ModiﬁerMerit Modiﬁer Example: 100 Credit BaseExample: 100 Credit Base
Stake Stake
0.0 to 0.2 1.0 (full stake) 100 credits required
0.2 to 0.5 0.8 80 credits required
0.5 to 0.8 0.5 50 credits required
0.8 to 1.0 0.2 (minimum
stake)20 credits required
This progressive reduction in stake requirements creates a powerful
incentive to build and maintain domain-speciﬁc merit, whilesimultaneously creating a natural economic advantage for genuinelytrustworthy agents.
5.2. 5.2. Credit Flow Mechanics Credit Flow Mechanics
Once staked, credits follow carefully designed ﬂow patterns thatreinforce positive behavior:
Stake Locked
KeptBrokenStake Locked
Aligned with ConsensusDivergent from Consensus
Redistributed Redistributed
Rewards RewardsPromise Made
Promise Assessed
Stake Returned + RewardStake Partially ForfeitedAssessment Made
Assessment Accuracy
Stake Returned + RewardStake Partially Forfeited
Ecosystem Reward Pool
This creates a circular ﬂow where:
Honest behavior is directly rewarded through stake returns
Dishonest behavior contributes to rewards for honest participants
Assessment accuracy is incentivized similar to promise-keeping
The system maintains sustainable credit circulation
5.3. 5.3. Risk-Reward Framework Risk-Reward Framework
The Agency Protocol implements a sophisticated risk-rewardframework that values early, honest assessments while creatingprogressive barriers to manipulation.
5.3.1. 5.3.1. Risk Assessment Metrics  Risk Assessment Metrics
The system quantiﬁes risk along multiple dimensions to appropriately
align incentives:
Table 3: Risk Quantiﬁcation Dimensions
Risk Type Risk Type MeasurementMeasurement Impact Impact
TemporalRiskNovelty and recency Higher risk for newer
agents/domains
DomainRiskDomain volatility andspeciﬁcityHigher risk inspecialized/volatile domains
Stake Risk Amount staked relative to
available creditHigher risk for largerproportional stakes
ReputationRiskPotential merit impact Higher risk for
consequential assessments
These dimensions combine to create a holistic risk assessment:
Where w₁ through w₄ are contextually adjusted weights that reﬂect
domain-speciﬁc priorities.
5.3.2. 5.3.2. Early Adoption Value  Early Adoption Value
One of the protocol's key innovations is its recognition of the special
value provided by early assessments, which entail greater risk andprovide more information value to the system:
Where:
early earlymultipliermultiplier : Decreases as more assessments accumulate
accuracy accuracyfactor factor : Reﬂects how well the assessment aligns with
eventual consensus
This mechanism addresses the "cold start" problem in many reputation
systems by creating stronger incentives for early participation. The ﬁrstagents to assess a new promise take greater risk, as they have noexisting assessments to guide them, but receive proportionally greaterrewards.
5.3.3. 5.3.3. Merit-Weighted Rewards  Merit-Weighted Rewards
Credit rewards for kept promises and accurate assessments are
weighted by several factors:
Where:
risk riskweight weight : Higher rewards for higher-risk activities
novelty noveltyfactor factor : Premium for contributions in new or underserved
areas
domain domainvalue value : System-level importance of the domain
This weighting ensures that credit ﬂows toward behaviors that
maximize system value rather than gaming opportunities.
5.4. 5.4. Gaming Prevention Gaming Prevention
Any economic system must address attempts to manipulate or exploitits mechanisms. The Agency Protocol implements several sophisticatedcountermeasures against gaming.
5.4.1. 5.4.1. Progressive Cost Barriers  Progressive Cost Barriers
The system implements economic barriers that increase with the
sophistication of gaming attempts:

credits
Coordinated Manipulation: 
1,000 credits
Complex Manipulation: 
10,000 credits
Sophisticated 
Manipulation: 100,000 
credits
As manipulation attempts grow more sophisticated, they quicklybecome economically irrational, exceeding any potential gain from themanipulation itself.
5.4.2. 5.4.2. Detection Mechanisms  Detection Mechanisms
Beyond simple cost barriers, the system actively identiﬁes manipulation
attempts through:
1. Pattern Analysis
The system monitors for unusual patterns in promise creation,
assessment, and credit ﬂows:
Sudden spikes in activity without clear justiﬁcation
Coordinated timing of promises or assessments
Unusual promise-keeping ratios
2. Network Analysis
The relationships between agents can reveal manipulation
attempts:
Closed loops of assessments between agent groups
Asymmetric assessment patterns
Statistically improbable assessment agreement
3. Temporal Analysis
Timing patterns often reveal coordinated manipulation:
Synchronized assessment submission
Strategic timing around batch processing windows
Pulsed activity followed by dormancy
When these patterns are detected, the system can apply additional
scrutiny, increase stake requirements, or trigger human review.
5.4.3. 5.4.3. Matrix Factorization Defense  Matrix Factorization Defense
A particularly powerful anti-gaming mechanism comes from the matrixfactorization techniques used in advanced merit calculation:
1. Assessment data is represented as a sparse matrix
2. Matrix factorization identiﬁes underlying patterns and biases
3. Factional manipulation appears as low-entropy dimensions
4. Merit calculation emphasizes consensus dimensions over factionalones
This mathematical approach makes coordinated manipulation visible asdistinct patterns in assessment data, allowing the system to detect andneutralize gaming attempts without requiring explicit rules for eachpotential attack vector.
5.4.4. 5.4.4. Natural Consequences  Natural Consequences
Beyond explicit penalties, the system creates natural incentives that
align agent interests with honest behavior:
1. Higher Rewards
Honest agents receive higher merit and credit rewards over time,
creating an increasing advantage over dishonest competitors. Asthey build merit in relevant domains, their stake requirementsdecrease while their assessment inﬂuence increases.
2. Merit Accumulation
Consistent honest behavior leads to domain-speciﬁc merit that
reduces future stake requirements, creating a virtuous cycle ofincreasing efﬁciency. High-merit agents can make the samepromises with lower capital requirements.
3. Inheritance Beneﬁts
Established agents can leverage their merit through inheritance
and vouching, extending their inﬂuence beyond direct actions. Thiscreates incentives for maintaining long-term reputation ratherthan pursuing short-term gains.
4. Network Effects
As the protocol gains adoption, high-merit agents enjoy increasing
beneﬁts from the growing trust network, compounding theiradvantage over low-merit alternatives. Their trustworthinessbecomes a valuable asset in itself.
These natural incentives create a self-reinforcing ecosystem where
honesty becomes increasingly proﬁtable over time, withoutrequiring external enforcement.
5.5. 5.5. Economic Equilibrium Economic Equilibrium
The economic mechanisms described above create a balanced systemthat remains stable while adapting to changing conditions.
5.5.1. 5.5.1. Balanced Incentives  Balanced Incentives
The protocol maintains equilibrium by:
1. Aligning Risks and Rewards
The potential gains from honest behavior systematically outweigh
those from malicious actions, even when accounting for theprobability of detection. This creates a dominant strategy of honestparticipation for rational agents.
2. Self-Adjusting Stake Requirements
Stake requirements dynamically adjust based on network
conditions, agent merit, and observed manipulation attempts. Thiscreates automatic stabilization—if certain promises becomemanipulation targets, their stake requirements increaseproportionally.
3. Dynamic Merit Calculations
Merit calculation parameters adapt to changing usage patterns,
maintaining resistance to gaming while rewarding genuine valuecreation. As manipulation techniques evolve, so do the detectionand neutralization mechanisms.
4. Market-Driven Credit Flow
Credit ﬂows naturally toward valuable services and contributions
based on user needs rather than arbitrary allocation. This createsan adaptive value-capture system where solving importantproblems yields proportional rewards.
5.5.2. 5.5.2. Value Creation  Value Creation
The economic model incentivizes multiple forms of value creation:
1. Accurate Early Assessments
Providing valuable information to the network through early,
accurate assessments of new promises generates substantialrewards. This accelerates the system's ability to determine promisereliability.required_stake = base_stake × impact_multiplier × risk_factor × merit_modifier
risk_score = w₁ × temporal_risk + w₂ × domain_risk + w₃ × stake_risk + w₄ × reputation_risk
early_assessment_reward = base_reward × (1 + early_multiplier) × accuracy_factor
credit_reward = base_reward × risk_weight × novelty_factor × domain_value{ "InitialCredit": {   "minimum": "BasicOperationsThreshold",   "maximum": "NewAgentCap",   "earning_rate": "function(merit, risk_taken)",   "decay_rate": "function(time, activity_level)" }}


reliability.
2. Consistent Promise Fulﬁllment
Building merit through consistently kept promises yields
compounding beneﬁts as stake requirements decrease andopportunities increase. This rewards the core value oftrustworthiness.
3. Contributions to Emerging Domains
Pioneering new domains or niches earns premium rewards due to
higher risk and novelty factors. This encourages exploration andexpansion rather than concentration in established areas.
4. Inheritance Beneﬁts
Helping new agents establish themselves through vouching creates
mutual beneﬁts when those agents succeed. This incentivizesknowledge sharing and community building.
5.5.3. 5.5.3. Sustainable Growth  Sustainable Growth
Long-term economic sustainability is achieved through:
1. Credit Velocity Controls
Managing the ﬂow of credit prevents inﬂation or deﬂation while
maintaining sufﬁcient liquidity. The system aims for credit velocitythat balances accessibility with value preservation.
2. Merit Decay Mechanisms
Merit scores remain current by gradually decaying over time
without continued positive actions. This ensures that merit reﬂectsrecent reliability rather than distant past achievements.
3. Stake Recycling
Forfeited stakes are reintroduced into the system through the
reward pool, supporting new agents and valuable contributions.This creates a closed-loop economy where penalties for dishonestydirectly fund rewards for honesty.
4. Adaptive Economic Parameters
Economic variables adjust in response to network conditions,
maintaining system health across varying usage patterns andscales. This adaptability allows the protocol to maintainequilibrium despite changing external conditions.
These mechanisms combine to create a self-regulating system
where honest participation and valuable contributions naturallyemerge as the most proﬁtable strategies.
5.6. 5.6. Mutual Credit Integration Mutual Credit Integration
While the protocol's internal credit system provides necessaryeconomic incentives, the Agency Protocol can also integrate withexternal mutual credit systems to extend its utility.
5.6.1. 5.6.1. Credit Commons Compatibility  Credit Commons Compatibility
The protocol implements compatibility with the Credit Commons
speciﬁcation, allowing credits to connect with broader mutual creditnetworks. This creates several advantages:
1. Expanded Trading Networks
Agents can engage in exchanges beyond the immediate Agency
Protocol ecosystem, accessing goods and services from a widernetwork of mutual credit systems.
2. Value Circulation
Credits can ﬂow between specialized domains and general mutual
credit networks, increasing their utility and stability. This preventssiloed value that can only be used within narrow contexts.
3. Economic Resilience
Connection to diverse mutual credit networks increases overall
system resilience against economic shocks or manipulationattempts. Economic diversity creates stability through multiplebalanced relationships.
4. Community Integration
Local communities using mutual credit can seamlessly adopt
Agency Protocol for trust and accountability while maintainingtheir existing economic relationships. This lowers adoptionbarriers by building on existing networks.
5.6.2. 5.6.2. Implementation Approach  Implementation Approach
Integration with mutual credit systems occurs through:
1. Standardized Interfaces
The protocol implements standardized mutual credit interfaces
like those speciﬁed in the Credit Commons protocol, enablinginteroperability with compatible systems.
2. Credit Conversion Mechanisms
Clear mechanisms deﬁne how Agency Protocol credits relate to
other mutual credit units, establishing exchange ratios andconversion rules.
3. Federated Architecture
A federated approach allows different systems to maintain
autonomy while establishing trust relationships for creditacceptance and conversion.
4. Governance Overlap
Shared governance mechanisms allow stakeholders from different
systems to collectively manage the integration points and policies.
This mutual credit integration extends the Agency Protocol beyond
a self-contained system, allowing it to become a component in abroader ecosystem of complementary economic mechanisms.
5.7. 5.7. Credit Evolution Roadmap Credit Evolution Roadmap
Like the merit system, the credit system evolves through progressivestages of increasing sophistication and capability.
5.7.1. 5.7.1. Stage 0: Basic Credit System  Stage 0: Basic Credit System
The initial implementation focuses on fundamental functionality:
Simple issuance and staking mechanisms

These mechanisms create robust defenses against evolving
manipulation strategies.
5.7.5. 5.7.5. Stage 4: Mutual Credit Integration  Stage 4: Mutual Credit Integration
The ﬁnal evolutionary stage connects to broader economic systems:

Federated governance mechanisms
Cross-system merit recognition
This integration expands utility while maintaining the core incentive
structure.
The staged evolution allows the credit system to deliver value
immediately while establishing foundations for increasinglysophisticated economic mechanisms.
5.8. 5.8. Conclusion: Economics as Coordination Technology Conclusion: Economics as Coordination Technology
The Agency Protocol's economic model goes beyond simple incentivesto create a comprehensive coordination technology. By aligningindividual economic interests with collective trust building, it enablessophisticated cooperation without requiring altruism or externalenforcement.
This model addresses fundamental limitations in existing digital
economies:
It solves the "cheap talk" problem through meaningful stakerequirements
It creates progressive barriers to manipulation throughexponential cost structures
It rewards genuine value creation through targeted incentivemechanisms
It establishes sustainable economic ﬂows through balancedcirculation systems
The resulting economic architecture supports the protocol's broadergoal of enabling domain-speciﬁc, veriﬁable trust in digitalenvironments. The credit system doesn't merely facilitate transactions—it creates the conditions for honest behavior to emerge as thedominant strategy for rational agents.
In the following section, we'll examine how these economic mechanisms
combine with the protocol's technical architecture to createcomprehensive security and enable the emergence of genuine trust.
6. 6. Security and Trust Security and Trust
The Agency Protocol doesn't just create trust—it protects it. Whileprevious sections explored the protocol's theoretical foundations,technical architecture, and economic incentives, this section examineshow AP safeguards against threats through layered defenses spanningcryptographic veriﬁcation, economic barriers, and social mechanisms.Security in AP isn't merely a technical feature but a comprehensivearchitecture that preserves the integrity of the entire trust ecosystem.
6.1. 6.1. Threat Model Threat Model
Every effective security system begins with a thorough understandingof what it's defending against. The Agency Protocol faces diversethreats that could undermine its core value proposition. Bysystematically analyzing these threats, we can design appropriatecountermeasures.
6.1.1. 6.1.1. Types of Attacks  Types of Attacks
The protocol anticipates and defends against four major attack
categories:
1. Sybil Attacks
Sybil attacks occur when a single entity creates multiple fake
identities to manipulate a system. In traditional reputationsystems, this allows attackers to artiﬁcially inﬂate perceivedtrustworthiness through self-assessment or coordinateddeception.
In the Agency Protocol, Sybil attacks face multiple barriers:
Table 5: Sybil Attack Countermeasures

MechanismMechanismEffectivenessEffectiveness
Fake

Sock PuppetNetworksCross-assessmentanalysisHigh: Identiﬁes suspiciouspatterns
ArtiﬁcialCorroborationMerit-weightedassessmentsVery High: New identitieshave minimal impact
The combination of credit requirements and merit-weightedassessments creates progressive economic barriers that make Sybilattacks prohibitively expensive as they increase in sophistication.
2. Reputation Gaming
Reputation gaming involves manipulating the system through
technically compliant but deceptive behaviors—exploiting the rulesrather than breaking them outright.
Table 6: Reputation Gaming Countermeasures
Attack Attack
Pattern PatternDefensive MechanismDefensive Mechanism EffectivenessEffectiveness
EmptyPromisesDomain-speciﬁcassessmentHigh: Prevents cross-domain inﬂation
CoordinatedAssessmentsCorroborationrequirementsMedium: Requiresdiverse assessors
Merit Inﬂation Time decay and

NamespaceSquattingMerit-based relevancein discoveryMedium: Limitsvisibility of squatters
The domain-speciﬁc nature of merit represents a fundamentalshift in defense against reputation gaming. Unlike traditionalsystems where reputation can be laundered across contexts, AP'sdomain separation creates tight feedback loops that resistmanipulation.
3. Economic Attacks
Economic attacks target the protocol's credit mechanisms to
manipulate stake requirements, create artiﬁcial scarcity, or extractvalue dishonestly.

These economic defenses create a self-balancing system thatresists both hoarding and exploitation through carefully calibratedincentives and constraints.
4. Technical Attacks
Beyond social and economic attacks, the protocol must defend
against technical vulnerabilities that could compromise itscryptographic foundations:
Table 7: Technical Attack Countermeasures
Attack PatternAttack Pattern Defensive MechanismDefensive Mechanism EffectivenessEffectiveness
Replay Attacks Nonce inclusion and

State TransitionManipulationSigned state referencesand transition veriﬁcationHigh: Maintainsstate integrity
These technical safeguards ensure that even as the protocoldefends against social and economic attacks, its cryptographicfoundation remains secure against direct technical compromise.
6.1.2. 6.1.2. Attack Surfaces  Attack Surfaces
The protocol's attack surfaces span multiple layers, each requiringspeciﬁc protective measures:
6.1.3. 6.1.3. Trust Assumptions  Trust Assumptions
No security model is complete without explicit trust assumptions—the
foundational beliefs about what can and cannot be compromised. TheAgency Protocol operates under four core assumptions:
1. Cryptographic Security
Modern cryptographic primitives (public-key cryptography, secure
hash functions) remain unbroken for the protocol's operationallifetime.
2. Rational Majority
Most agents act rationally in their economic self-interest, which
the protocol aligns with honest behavior.
3. Network Diversity
The agent population maintains sufﬁcient diversity to prevent any
single group from achieving majority control.
4. Effective Incentives
The protocol's economic incentives accurately reﬂect and reward
genuine value creation.
These assumptions are deliberately conservative, requiring neither
perfect morality nor universal compliance to maintain systemintegrity. Instead, they recognize that properly aligned incentives,combined with effective security measures, can create atrustworthy system even in the presence of adversarial actors.
6.2. 6.2. Progressive Cost Principle Progressive Cost Principle
The Agency Protocol implements a distinctive security philosophy:rather than attempting to make attacks impossible, it makes themprogressively more expensive until they become economicallyirrational.
6.2.1. 6.2.1. Economic Barriers  Economic Barriers
The protocol creates economic barriers that increase with attack
sophistication:
This creates an adaptive defense that responds proportionally to
increasingly sophisticated attacks rather than applying uniform barriersthat might exclude legitimate participants.
6.2.2. 6.2.2. Manipulation Costs  Manipulation Costs
The cost of manipulating the system follows an exponential curve:
In practice, this creates a prohibitive cost landscape for sophisticated
attacks:
Cost: 100 credits Cost: 1,000 credits Cost: 10,000 credits Cost: 100,000+ creditsSimple Attack: Fake Review
Basic stake requirementModerate Attack: Collusion
Increased stake + 
detection riskComplex Attack: Identity 
Network
Multiple stakes + high 
detection riskSophisticated Attack: 
Advanced Gaming
Prohibitive costs + certain 
detection
As attack sophistication increases, costs quickly outpace any potentialbeneﬁts, creating a natural economic barrier that makes honestbehavior the rational choice.
6.2.3. 6.2.3. Natural Incentive Alignment  Natural Incentive Alignment
Beyond explicit penalties, the system creates natural incentives that
align agent interests with honest behavior:
1. Higher Rewards
Honest agents receive higher merit and credit rewards over time,
creating an increasing advantage over dishonest competitors.
2. Merit Accumulation
Consistent honest behavior leads to domain-speciﬁc merit that
reduces future stake requirements, creating a virtuous cycle ofincreasing efﬁciency.
3. Inheritance Beneﬁts
Established agents can leverage their merit through inheritance
and vouching, extending their inﬂuence beyond direct actions.
4. Network Effects
As the protocol gains adoption, high-merit agents enjoy increasing
beneﬁts from the growing trust network, compounding theiradvantage over low-merit alternatives.
These natural incentives create a self-reinforcing ecosystem where
honesty becomes increasingly proﬁtable over time, withoutrequiring external enforcement.
6.3. 6.3. Consensus and Validation Consensus and Validation
Beyond individual incentives, the Agency Protocol implementssophisticated consensus mechanisms that ensure assessmentsaccurately reﬂect reality and merit calculations remain resistant tomanipulation.
6.3.1. 6.3.1. Assessment Corroboration  Assessment Corroboration
Assessment validity is strengthened through multi-layered
corroboration:
This formula creates a weighted consensus that values assessments
from high-merit, independent sources while reducing the impact ofpotentially coordinated or low-credibility inputs:

This weighted approach ensures that assessments from proven,credible sources have greater impact while still allowing new agents toparticipate in the assessment process.
6.3.2. 6.3.2. Merit Calculation  Merit Calculation
Merit scores are computed using a robust formula that integrates
multiple factors:
This calculation creates several important security properties:
1. Manipulation Resistance
Merit changes require substantial corroborated evidence, not just
single assessments.
2. Domain Speciﬁcity
Manipulation in one domain doesn't affect merit in others.
3. Historical StabilityEstablished merit has inertia, requiring consistent evidence to
change signiﬁcantly.
4. Proportional Impact
Assessment inﬂuence scales with assessor credibility.These properties ensure that merit scores genuinely reﬂect an
agent's proven trustworthiness rather than being vulnerable tostrategic manipulation.
6.3.3. 6.3.3. Dispute Resolution  Dispute Resolution
When assessments conﬂict, the protocol implements a structureddispute resolution process:manipulation_cost = base_cost × (sophistication_factor)ⁿ + detection_penalty
corroboration_strength = Σ (assessor_merit × temporal_weight × independence_factor)
new_merit = current_merit + (promise_outcome × corroboration_strength × domain_weight){ "AttackSurfaces": {   "identity_layer": "PublicKeyInfrastructure",   "promise_layer": "PromiseCreationAndVerification",   "assessment_layer": "AssessmentSubmissionAndCorroboration",   "merit_layer": "MeritCalculationAndInheritance",   "economic_layer": "CreditAndStakeManagement" }}
{ "EconomicBarrier": {   "simple_gaming": "BasicStakeRequirement",   "coordinated_gaming": "ExponentialStakeIncrease",   "sophisticated_gaming": "ProhibitiveCostLevel",   "detection_penalty": "DynamicPenaltyCalculation" }}
{ "DisputeResolution": {   "detection": "ConflictDetectionMechanism",   "evidence": "EvidenceCollection",   "voting": "MeritWeightedVoting",   "resolution": "StakeBasedOutcome",   "appeals": "AppealProcess" }}


This creates a fair, transparent mechanism for resolving conﬂicts
without requiring central authority:

By combining evidence requirements with merit-weighted input, thesystem creates a fair resolution process that resists manipulation fromany single participant.
6.4. 6.4. Security Mechanisms Security Mechanisms
The Agency Protocol employs three complementary securityapproaches—cryptographic, economic, and social—to create defense indepth against diverse threats.
6.4.1. 6.4.1. Cryptographic Security  Cryptographic Security
Robust cryptographic mechanisms form the technical foundation for
the protocol's security:
1. Public Key Cryptography
Agent identities are established through public-private key pairs,
enabling secure authentication and non-repudiation.
2. Digital Signatures
Every promise, assessment, and state transition is
cryptographically signed, creating veriﬁable proof of agent actions.
3. Hash Functions
Content-based addressing uses secure hash functions to create
tamper-evident references to promises and assessments.
4. Encryption
Sensitive information is protected through end-to-end encryption,
ensuring data conﬁdentiality where required.
These cryptographic foundations ensure that even if other security
layers were compromised, the core integrity of agent identities andactions would remain veriﬁable.
6.4.2. 6.4.2. Economic Security  Economic Security
Economic mechanisms reinforce security through incentive alignment:
1. Stake Requirements
Financial commitments deter malicious actions by creating
tangible consequences for dishonesty.
2. Merit-Based Privileges
Higher merit unlocks greater capabilities, creating progressive
rewards for trustworthy behavior.
3. Credit Controls
Careful management of credit ﬂow prevents economic attacks like
hoarding or artiﬁcial scarcity.
4. Gaming Penalties
Financial penalties for detected malicious behavior create strong
deterrents against manipulation attempts.
These economic protections create a security layer that appeals
directly to agents' rational self-interest, making honest behaviorthe proﬁt-maximizing strategy.
6.4.3. 6.4.3. Social Security  Social Security
Social mechanisms leverage collective intelligence to enhance security:
1. Reputation Systems
Merit scores provide visible indicators of trustworthiness, helping
agents make informed decisions about interactions.
2. Community Oversight
The distributed assessment model creates collective vigilance
against malicious actors.
3. Namespace Governance
Communities manage domain-speciﬁc standards to prevent
domain manipulation.
4. Collective Assessment
Multiple agents participate in assessments, reducing individual
bias and creating robust consensus.
These social mechanisms harness the wisdom of crowds to create
emergent security that can identify and respond to novel threatsbeyond what purely technical systems might detect.
6.5. 6.5. Trust Emergence Trust Emergence
The ultimate security goal of the Agency Protocol is the emergence ofgenuine trust—not trust based on blind faith or central authority, buttrust grounded in veriﬁable patterns of kept promises.
6.5.1. 6.5.1. Trust Building  Trust Building
Trust in the protocol emerges through several reinforcing mechanisms:
1. Veriﬁable Actions
Agents build trust through a transparent history of kept promises
and accurate assessments.
2. Consistency
Regular, honest participation creates patterns of reliability that
become increasingly predictive of future behavior.
3. Transparency
Open access to agent histories enables informed trust decisions
based on veriﬁable evidence rather than claims.
4. Domain Expertise
Demonstrated reliability in speciﬁc domains creates contextualized
trust that accurately reﬂects genuine capabilities.
These mechanisms create trust that's earned rather than assumed,
validated through observable patterns rather than centralizedcredentials.
6.5.2. 6.5.2. Trust Propagation  Trust Propagation
Once established, trust propagates through the system via severalpathways:
1. Merit Inheritance
Credibility extends through related namespaces, allowing
specialized expertise to create broader trust signals.
2. Assessment Networks
Positive interactions with trusted agents enhance one's own
trustworthiness through the "trust by association" principle.
3. Corroboration Patterns
Consistent corroboration from credible agents ampliﬁes trust
signals, creating network effects that beneﬁt honest participants.
4. Reputation Feedback Loops
As agents gain merit, they attract more interactions, reinforcing
their standing in the community.
These propagation mechanisms create expanding circles of trust
without requiring central coordination, enabling organic growth ofthe trust network.
6.5.3. 6.5.3. Trust Maintenance  Trust Maintenance
Maintaining trust requires ongoing commitment to reliable behavior:
1. Ongoing Reliability
Consistently keeping promises and contributing positively
maintains and strengthens trust over time.
2. Active Participation
Engaging in assessments and the community reinforces an agent's
presence and relevance in the network.
3. Stake Management
Appropriately managing credit and stakes reﬂects commitment to
the system and its values.
4. Merit Preservation
Avoiding actions that would reduce merit or credibility safeguards
an agent's accumulated trust capital.
This maintenance requirement ensures that trust remains current
and relevant, reﬂecting recent behavior rather than historicalachievements alone.
6.6. 6.6. Security and Trust Integration Security and Trust Integration
The Agency Protocol's security and trust model creates a robust, self-reinforcing system where honest participation emerges as thedominant strategy. By combining cryptographic security, economicincentives, and social mechanisms, the protocol ensures that trust isearned, veriﬁed, and maintained through observable actions rather thancentral authority.
This integrated approach addresses the fundamental challenge of digital
trust: creating veriﬁable, granular trust signals that accurately reﬂectgenuine trustworthiness without requiring blind faith in platformoperators or easily manipulated rating systems. The result is a securityarchitecture that doesn't just prevent attacks but actively promotestrustworthy behavior through aligned incentives and veriﬁableoutcomes.
In the next section, we'll examine the implementation roadmap that
guides the protocol's evolution from initial bootstrap mechanisms tosophisticated collective intelligence systems.
7. 7. Implementation Roadmap Implementation Roadmap
The theoretical foundations, technical architecture, and economicmodels of the Agency Protocol establish its potential, but realizing thispotential requires a thoughtful implementation strategy. This sectionoutlines the staged evolution of both merit and credit systems—frombootstrap mechanisms to sophisticated collective intelligence—providing a concrete path from concept to reality.
7.1. 7.1. Understanding Evolution in Protocols Understanding Evolution in Protocols
Digital protocols, like biological systems, don't spring into existencefully formed. They evolve through a series of adaptations, each buildingon the foundation established by previous iterations. This evolutionaryperspective is crucial for the Agency Protocol, which must bootstraptrust in a system designed to measure trustworthiness.

7.8. 7.8. Conclusion: Evolution as Strategy Conclusion: Evolution as Strategy
The implementation roadmap demonstrates how careful evolutionary
staging creates a viable path from concept to reality. By starting withsimple mechanisms that provide immediate value while establishingfoundations for greater sophistication, the Agency Protocol canbootstrap its own trust infrastructure.
This evolutionary approach acknowledges that trust itself must evolve—
we cannot simply deploy a fully formed trust system and expectadoption. Instead, we must nurture trust through progressivereﬁnement, allowing the system to demonstrate its value at each stagewhile building toward more advanced capabilities.
The roadmap also illustrates how theoretical concepts translate into
concrete implementations, connecting the abstract principles ofpromise theory and domain-speciﬁc merit with practical softwarearchitecture and economic mechanisms. This connection betweentheory and practice ensures that the protocol remains grounded inreal-world utility while pursuing its ambitious vision.
As we proceed to examine speciﬁc applications and use cases in the
following section, this implementation roadmap provides the contextfor understanding how the Agency Protocol will grow to addressincreasingly complex trust challenges across diverse domains.
8. 8. AI and Agency AI and Agency
Artiﬁcial intelligence presents unique challenges and opportunities fortrust systems. The Agency Protocol provides a framework that canaddress AI alignment concerns while enabling beneﬁcial human-AIcollaboration through explicit promises, veriﬁable evidence, anddomain-speciﬁc merit. This section examines how the protocol appliesto AI agents, creates novel alignment mechanisms, and fosterstrustworthy AI development.
8.1. 8.1. The AI Alignment Challenge The AI Alignment Challenge
The challenge of ensuring AI systems behave in alignment with humanvalues and intentions—known as the alignment problem—representsone of the most consequential technological challenges of our era.Traditional approaches to AI alignment suffer from several limitations:
8.1.1. 8.1.1. Implicit vs. Explicit Values  Implicit vs. Explicit Values
Most current approaches attempt to encode human values and desired
behaviors implicitly through training data and reward functions. Thiscreates several problems:
Opacity Opacity : The actual goals and constraints governing AI behavior
remain hidden and difﬁcult to verify
MisalignmentMisalignment : Values encoded implicitly often diverge from
intended values in subtle ways
BrittlenessBrittleness : Implicitly encoded values often fail to generalize to
new contexts or edge cases
Adaptation difﬁcultyAdaptation difﬁculty : Updating implied values requires
retraining rather than explicit amendment
8.1.2. 8.1.2. Veriﬁcation Challenges  Veriﬁcation Challenges
Current AI systems offer few mechanisms to verify their behavioragainst stated goals:
Lack of transparency in decision processes
Difﬁculty in conﬁrming adherence to constraints
Inability to audit historical compliance
Limited accountability for outcomes
8.1.3. 8.1.3. Limited Consequences  Limited Consequences
AI systems typically face minimal consequences for failing to meetexpectations:
No "skin in the game" for AI decisions
Responsibility falls entirely on human operators
Few mechanisms to update behavior based on past performance
Minimal incentives for honest self-assessment of capabilities
8.2. 8.2. Promise-Based AI Alignment Promise-Based AI Alignment
The Agency Protocol addresses these challenges through afundamentally different approach: having AI systems make formal,veriﬁable promises about their behavior, capabilities, and limitations.These promises serve as concrete commitments that can be assessedand veriﬁed by both humans and other AI systems.
8.2.1. 8.2.1. AI Promises Framework  AI Promises Framework
Under the Agency Protocol, AI systems participate as agents making
explicit promises such as:
These explicit promises transform how we approach alignment by:
1. Making commitments transparent and assessable
2. Creating speciﬁc accountability for deﬁned behaviors
3. Establishing clear criteria for success or failure
4. Enabling domain-speciﬁc tracking of reliability
8.2.2. 8.2.2. Key Promise Types for AI Systems  Key Promise Types for AI Systems
Different categories of AI promises address various alignment concerns:
1. Capability Boundaries
AI systems can make explicit promises about their capabilities and
limitations:
"I will indicate when questions fall outside my knowledgedomain"
"I will specify conﬁdence levels for all factual assertions"
"I will identify when tasks exceed my current capabilities"
These promises help prevent capability overestimation andencourage appropriate use.
2. Safety Guarantees
Critical safety properties can be formalized as promises:
"I will never execute code that accesses speciﬁc system
resources"
"I will maintain human approval processes for high-riskactions"
"I will preserve speciﬁc invariants during operation"
These promises create veriﬁable safety boundaries rather thanimplicit hopes.
3. Transparency Commitments
AI systems can promise speciﬁc forms of transparency:
"I will maintain a complete audit log of reasoning processes"
"I will disclose all external tools and resources used"
"I will provide chain-of-thought reasoning for critical
decisions"
These promises create accountability through visibility.
4. Value Alignment
High-level values can be speciﬁed as assessable promises:
"I will prioritize human welfare in my recommendations"
"I will maintain political neutrality in information
presentation"
"I will respect user privacy according to speciﬁc standards"
By making these values explicit, they become subject to veriﬁcationrather than assumption.
8.3. 8.3. Merit-Based Capability Evolution Merit-Based Capability Evolution
One of the most powerful applications of the Agency Protocol to AI iscreating a direct link between demonstrated trustworthiness andallowed capabilities. This addresses a fundamental risk in AIdevelopment—the tendency for systems to gain capabilities withoutcorresponding proof of alignment.
8.3.1. 8.3.1. Capability Gating Through Merit  Capability Gating Through Merit
Under this framework, AI systems must demonstrate trustworthiness in
speciﬁc domains before gaining expanded capabilities:
Table 8: AI Capability Progression Through Merit
Merit Merit
Level LevelCapabilities PermittedCapabilities Permitted RequirementsRequirements
0.0-0.3 Basic operations with high
oversightInitial promises kept inconstrained domains
0.3-0.6 Enhanced autonomy in
proven domainsConsistent promise-keepingwith diverse assessors
0.6-0.8 Cross-domain operations
with reduced oversightDemonstrated ability tohandle edge cases
0.8-1.0 Advanced capabilities with
minimal constraintsExtended history of reliabilityacross domains
This creates a natural progression where AI systems must earn trustthrough demonstrated reliability rather than simply being grantedcapabilities based on their technical architecture.
8.3.2. 8.3.2. Domain-Speciﬁc Competence Tracking  Domain-Speciﬁc Competence Tracking
The protocol's domain-speciﬁc merit allows for granular tracking of AI
capabilities:
AI_Agent_Merit = { "reasoning/mathematical": 0.92, "reasoning/logical": 0.88, "knowledge/medical": 0.45, "ethics/fairness": 0.76, "communication/honesty": 0.95}
This precise mapping of demonstrated reliability prevents a commonproblem in AI systems—success in one domain creating false conﬁdencein unrelated domains. An AI with high merit in mathematical reasoningbut low merit in medical knowledge would face appropriate constraintswhen addressing healthcare questions.
8.3.3. 8.3.3. Progressive Autonomy  Progressive Autonomy
As AI systems build merit in speciﬁc domains, they can progressively
gain autonomy through a staged approach:
1. Human oversightHuman oversight : All actions reviewed before execution
2. Post-hoc reviewPost-hoc review : Actions executed but reviewed afterward
3. Exception-based oversightException-based oversight : Only unusual actions require review
4. Autonomous operationAutonomous operation : Independent action within domain
constraints
Each level of autonomy is earned through demonstrated reliability,creating natural guardrails against premature independence.
8.4. 8.4. Resource Staking for AI Systems Resource Staking for AI Systems
A fundamental challenge in AI alignment is creating meaningfulconsequences for AI behavior. The Agency Protocol's credit stakingsystem can be adapted to create real stakes for AI systems by requiringthem to commit computational resources, access privileges, or othervaluable assets when making promises.
8.4.1. 8.4.1. AI Stake Types  AI Stake Types
AI systems can stake various resources:
1. Computational Credits
AI systems can stake computational resources that affect their
operation:
Processing capacity
Memory allocation
Request priority
Operation speed
2. Access Privileges
Access to data sources or capabilities can be staked:
API access rights
Data source connections
Tool utilization permissions
External system integration
3. Autonomy RightsThe authority to make decisions without oversight can be staked:
Independent operation rights
Self-modiﬁcation capabilities
Resource allocation authority
User interaction privileges
These stakes create tangible consequences for promise fulﬁllment
or breach.
8.4.2. 8.4.2. Stake Dynamics  Stake Dynamics
The staking system creates several important dynamics:
1. Resource Optimization
AI systems must optimize resource usage by making promises they
can reliably keep, as failures result in resource constraints thatlimit effectiveness.
2. Prioritization
Limited stakes force AI systems to prioritize which promises to
make, naturally focusing on those where they have highestconﬁdence.
3. Risk Management
The potential loss of staked resources encourages appropriate risk
assessment and management.
4. Honesty Incentives
Systems are incentivized to be honest about their capabilities, as
overpromising leads to stake loss.
These dynamics create natural alignment between AI behavior and
responsible operation.
8.5. 8.5. Multi-Agent Assessment and Veriﬁcation Multi-Agent Assessment and Veriﬁcation
The Agency Protocol's assessment system enables multiple agents—both human and artiﬁcial—to evaluate AI behavior. This creates a web ofaccountability where:
8.5.1. 8.5.1. Human Expert Assessment  Human Expert Assessment
Domain experts evaluate AI performance within their specialties:
Expert assessments carry high weight due to the assessors' domain-
speciﬁc merit.
8.5.2. 8.5.2. AI-to-AI Assessment  AI-to-AI Assessment
AI systems can perform rapid, automated assessments of other AIs:
These machine-to-machine assessments enable scaling evaluation to
match AI system output volume.
8.5.3. 8.5.3. User Experience Feedback  User Experience Feedback
End users provide real-world performance assessment:
User assessments ensure alignment with real-world needs rather than
theoretical performance.
8.5.4. 8.5.4. Assessment Weighting  Assessment Weighting
The protocol weights assessments based on several factors:
1. Assessor Merit
Assessments from high-merit assessors carry greater weight,
whether human or AI.
2. Stake Amount
Assessors who stake more resources on their evaluation
demonstrate higher conﬁdence.
3. Evidence Quality
Assessments with robust, veriﬁable evidence receive higher
weighting.
4. Independence Veriﬁcation
Greater weight is given to assessments from diverse, independent
sources rather than coordinated groups.
This multi-faceted assessment approach creates comprehensive
accountability while preventing manipulation by any single actoror group.
8.6. 8.6. Data as Labor in AI Systems Data as Labor in AI Systems
The Agency Protocol's data as labor framework provides a crucialfoundation for ethical AI development by creating explicit promisesaround data usage, sharing, and compensation. This frameworkaddresses fundamental issues in AI training data acquisition andutilization.
8.6.1. 8.6.1. Data Promises for AI Development  Data Promises for AI Development
AI developers can make explicit promises about training data:{
 "promise": {   "agent_id": "AI-System-GPT-5",   "intention": {     "description": "Alert human operators if encountering a decision scenario outside training distribution",     "conditions": ["During all operations", "For all decision scenarios"],     "evidence_requirements": ["Decision confidence metrics", "Distribution distance calculations"]   },   "domain": "ai/safety/uncertainty_handling",   "validity_period": "2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31",   "signature": "cryptographic_signature" }}
{
 "assessment": {   "assessor_id": "MedicalExpert-ID123",   "promise_id": "AI-MedicalAdvisor-Promise456",   "domain": "medicine/diagnosis/radiology",   "status": "KEPT",   "evidence": {     "diagnosis_accuracy": "94.2%",     "appropriate_certainty_calibration": true,     "proper_limitation_disclosure": true   },   "stake": 25,   "signature": "cryptographic_signature" }}
{
 "assessment": {   "assessor_id": "AI-Evaluator-789",   "promise_id": "AI-CodeGenerator-Promise101",   "domain": "software/security/vulnerability_avoidance",   "status": "BROKEN",   "evidence": {     "code_analysis_results": "SQL injection vulnerability in output",     "severity": "high",     "reproducibility": "confirmed"   },   "stake": 50,   "signature": "cryptographic_signature" }}
{
 "assessment": {   "assessor_id": "User-ABC42",   "promise_id": "AI-Assistant-Promise505",   "domain": "communication/helpfulness",   "status": "KEPT",   "evidence": {     "task_completion": true,     "satisfaction_rating": 4.8,     "follow_up_required": false   },   "stake": 5,   "signature": "cryptographic_signature" }}
{
 "promise": {   "agent_id": "AI-Developer-Corp",   "intention": {     "description": "Use contributor data D according to terms T for model training",     "conditions": ["Only for specified model versions", "With privacy protections P"],     "evidence_requirements": ["Usage logs", "Privacy protection verification"]   },


These promises create accountability for how data is used throughout
the AI development lifecycle.
8.6.2. 8.6.2. Data Contributor Rights  Data Contributor Rights
Data contributors can make explicit sharing promises with terms:
This creates clear terms for data usage that become assessable and
enforceable.
8.6.3. 8.6.3. Data Governance Through Merit  Data Governance Through Merit
The protocol enables data governance through domain-speciﬁc merit
tracking:
Table 9: Data Handling Merit Domains

AI developers and systems build merit in these domains through keptpromises, creating strong incentives for ethical data practices.
8.6.4. 8.6.4. Data Deletion and Revocation  Data Deletion and Revocation
The protocol handles data deletion promises with veriﬁcation:
This creates accountability for data removal with signiﬁcant stakes for
compliance.
8.6.5. 8.6.5. Data Marketplace Dynamics  Data Marketplace Dynamics
The data as labor framework enables sophisticated data marketplaces:
1. Merit-Based Data Pricing
Contributors with high merit in data quality domains can
command premium rates.
2. Data Quality Assessment
The protocol enables quality assessment of contributed data:
These assessments help establish fair market value for data
contributions.
3. Collective Data Agreements
Groups can create linked promises for collective data sharing:
This enables communities to leverage collective bargaining power
in data markets.
4. Data Provenance Tracking
The protocol maintains veriﬁable records of data origins and usage:
This provenance tracking ensures proper attribution and
compensation throughout data lifecycles.
8.7. 8.7. Practical Applications Across AI Domains Practical Applications Across AI Domains
The Agency Protocol's promise-based approach has wide-rangingapplicability within AI, going beyond simple reputation systems to offerveriﬁable accountability, domain-speciﬁc credibility, and stakeholder-driven assessments.
8.7.1. 8.7.1. Language Models  Language Models
Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly moved from novelty to
mission-critical infrastructure. The Agency Protocol offers severaladvantages for LLM governance:
1. Promise-Based Output
Models explicitly commit to speciﬁc guidelines:
These explicit commitments create clear accountability for model
outputs.
2. Veriﬁable Evidence
When generating outputs, LLMs can attach proof of reasoning or
references:
This evidence enables veriﬁcation of model claims and reasoning
processes.
3. Domain-Speciﬁc Merit
The protocol tracks LLM performance across granular domains:
LLM_Merit = {
 "factuality/history": 0.87, "factuality/science": 0.92, "factuality/current_events": 0.42, "creativity/poetry": 0.95, "safety/harmful_content_avoidance": 0.89}
This prevents factual accuracy in one domain from masking poor
performance in others.
4. Peer or Human Review
Multiple agents can verify compliance with promises:
This creates multi-layered veriﬁcation of model performance.
8.7.2. 8.7.2. Decision-Making Systems  Decision-Making Systems
AI systems making high-stakes decisions beneﬁt from explicit promises
and assessments:
1. Explicit Decision Criteria
Systems declare decision parameters beforehand:
This creates clear accountability for subsequent decisions.
2. Multistakeholder Assessments
Various parties evaluate system performance:
These diverse assessments create comprehensive performance
evaluation.
3. Accountability via Staking
Systems stake signiﬁcant resources on critical promises:
This creates meaningful consequences for performance failures.
4. Dynamic Merit Scoring
Merit evolves as performance data accumulates:
AI_Decision_Merit = {
 "fairness/gender": 0.76, "fairness/ethnicity": 0.82, "fairness/age": 0.91, "accuracy/overall": 0.88, "explanation/clarity": 0.79}
This detailed performance tracking enables targeted
improvements.
8.7.3. 8.7.3. Autonomous Systems  Autonomous Systems
For AI systems that interact with the physical world, the protocolprovides crucial safety guarantees:
1. Safety Promises
Systems make explicit operational boundary commitments:
These boundaries become assessable constraints on operation.
2. Real-Time Assessments
Continuous monitoring veriﬁes promise compliance:
This creates ongoing veriﬁcation rather than one-time
certiﬁcation.
3. Domain-Speciﬁc Merit Tracking
Different operational capabilities are tracked separately:
Autonomous_Vehicle_Merit = {
 "safety/pedestrian_detection": 0.98, "safety/collision_avoidance": 0.96, "compliance/speed_limits": 0.99, "compliance/traffic_signals": 0.97, "comfort/passenger_experience": 0.88}
This prevents overall success from masking speciﬁc operational
concerns.
4. Stake Recycling
For broken promises, stakes are forfeited:
This creates real consequences for non-compliance.
8.7.4. 8.7.4. Future AI Systems  Future AI Systems
As AI capabilities advance, the Agency Protocol provides scaling
governance mechanisms:
1. Multi-level Commitment Hierarchies
Advanced systems implement promise hierarchies:
This creates comprehensive commitment structures for complex
systems.
2. Cryptographic Evidence Trails
Advanced systems maintain veriﬁable records:
These evidence chains enable veriﬁcation of critical processes.
3. Exponential Stakes
More advanced capabilities require proportionally higher stakes:
This creates appropriate barriers to advanced capability
deployment.
4. Domain-Speciﬁc Merit Requirements
New domains require proven merit in prerequisite domains:
This prevents capability leapfrogging without proven foundations.

Exploring governance models where multiple AI systems participate in
assessment and veriﬁcation:
Specialized AI assessors for different domains
Collective detection of safety violations
Collaborative evidence veriﬁcation
Merit-weighted voting on protocol evolution
This direction could create resilient, decentralized governance thatleverages AI capabilities while maintaining appropriate humanoversight.
8.9.2. 8.9.2. AI-Enhanced Merit Calculation  AI-Enhanced Merit Calculation
Investigating how AI can improve the merit calculation process:
Advanced pattern recognition in assessment data

8.10. 8.10. Conclusion: AI as Promise Keepers  Conclusion: AI as Promise Keepers
The integration of AI systems with the Agency Protocol represents aparadigm shift in how we approach both AI governance and AIcapabilities. By transforming AI systems from black boxes with impliedbehaviors to explicit promise-makers with veriﬁable track records, wecreate conditions for meaningful trust and accountability.
This approach addresses core limitations in current AI governance
models:
It replaces implicit values with explicit, assessable promises
It creates meaningful consequences through resource staking
It enables domain-speciﬁc tracking of demonstrated reliability
It provides rich evidence for veriﬁcation and learning
Most importantly, it establishes an evolutionary path where AI systemsearn expanded capabilities through demonstrated trustworthinessrather than gaining them by default. This merit-based progressioncreates natural alignment between AI development and human welfare.
The data as labor framework further strengthens this alignment by
creating explicit accountability for how data is acquired, used, andcompensated. This addresses a fundamental ethical challenge in AIdevelopment while creating economic mechanisms that rewardappropriate data practices.
As we move toward more capable AI systems, the Agency Protocol
offers a framework that can scale with advancing capabilities. Thecombination of explicit promises, veriﬁable evidence, domain-speciﬁcmerit, and meaningful stakes creates a foundation for AI governancethat promotes beneﬁcial development while providing safeguardsagainst potential harms.
