General Comment
Am erica has been a leader in so m any creative fields, whatever m edia you can nam e, we've been the leaders. But if you pass a law that
says AI can scrape all that copywritten m aterial, we will lose all that. Nobody will want to com e here for their businesses when they know
that they could just have their m aterial stolen. Not to m ention AI has been proven to be wildly unpopular with custom ers, alm ost every
study into the subject have found that custom ers find products that use AI to be cheap and they're less likely to invest in it. Pull back on
the AI, there is still tim e, and considering how m uch AI is costing com panies, it's no wonder why every study has said that this is a bubble
that is likely to pop. Pull back on AI, stick with the copyright laws we have, and we can keep Am erica at the top of the tech world while
everyone else chases trends.
