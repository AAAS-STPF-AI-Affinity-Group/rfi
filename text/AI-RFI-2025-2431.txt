General Comment
Generative AI presents a real danger not only to the creative fields of work but also to the consum er. Generative AI has negatively
im pacted web search filling results with unusable inform ation that requires m ore tim e to parse and im ages using data that was obtained
without perm ission often outrank actual pictures. I have seen first hand how generative AI has oversaturated the field of com m ission
illustration devaluing the work of artists and of creative work as a whole. at the end of the day, the sad irony that we are autom ating things
like art instead of the m undane aspects of life should not be lost to us.
