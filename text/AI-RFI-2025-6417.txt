General Comment
As an educator and advocate for artists, I find this abhorrent. The idea that LLM's m odels can draw on and explicitly use the works of
artists, writers, film m akers, and other creative with im punity is legally flawed, m orally bankrupt, and driven by the unending am bitions of
billionaire tech-m agnates and their aspirants. It is violation of integrity that hands the bard work of cultural com posers to the inexpert (if
you can even use that kind of language about an LLM). This strips the rights away from  creators, som ething this country has always seen
as sacrosanct. If this is the case why aren't all works in The Public Dom ain? Why is it only through the m anipulation of these LLM tools
that copyright no longer m atters? This plan is abhorrent and m ust be stopped.
Regards,
Dr. Benjam in Jude Wright
