General Comment
It is im perative that this technology not have free access to copyrighted m aterial or intellectual property.
I am  writing as a business owner, educator, and a creative director in the entertainm ent industry with knowledge of tradem ark and
copyright, as well as com plex technologies.
Allowing AI access to copyrighted works weakens the United States’ position to protect it’s intellectual property and unique cultural
contributions (ie the entertainm ent industry as a whole which generates billions in revenue due to it’s capability to control ownership of
intellectual property. This includes the sale and securitization thereof.
If Artificial Intelligence m odels are allowed to use copyrighted works for com m ercial m achine learning purposes they would do m assive
dam age to the United States econom ically and as a leader worldwide. It would also give m assive advantage to our international
com petitors who would be able to argue for their own use of US copyrighted m aterials for their own m achine learning, or at the very least
use the sam e technology.
The technology itself m ust not be perm itted to utilize copyrighted works in it’s m achine learning without a system  for licensing and
com pensation to owners of intellectual property.
If the technology is unable to im plem ent such safeguards, or possible to be controlled, then it is too early in it’s developm ent and not fit for
use.
Especially not where any m anner of sensitive data or copyrighted m aterial is concerned.
