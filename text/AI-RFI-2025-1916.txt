General Comment
Generative AI trained on copyrighted m aterial is dangerous to the livelihoods of sm all creatives as well as destructive to the concept of IP
ownership that large com panies rely on. The argum ent that this will "prom ote hum an flourishing" does not hold up, given that the result of
unlim ited training on any and all creative works m eans the devaluation of an individual hum an's creative work. Not only that, the results of
AI-generated algorithm s are unreliable as inform ation, inconsistent, and lacking in creativity, so even the hum an consum ption of that data is
negative. It offloads critical thinking to a com puter, which then turns around and delivers false inform ation, which hum ans then take as fact.
Additionally, the environm ental im pact of running the servers required to use AI is dam aging hum an lives.
We need to divest from  AI and im pose m ore regulation, not less.
