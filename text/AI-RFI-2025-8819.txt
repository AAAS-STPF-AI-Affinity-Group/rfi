General Comment
Allowing AI authors to violate copyright underm ines the entire basis of copyright. If they wish to profit from  these m aterials they should be
willing to negotiate for fair use from  the copyright holders. 
If they are unwilling to do so, this so called industry is m erely a vehicle for IP theft. 
Do not allow AI driven initiatives to steal from  hard working citizens with im punity.
