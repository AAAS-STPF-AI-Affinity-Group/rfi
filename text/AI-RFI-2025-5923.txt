General Comment
This proposal is not com patible with the Berne Convention, US copyright law, US property law, or court precedent.
The US governm ent should not be in the business of picking winners and losers.
If AI com panies need data for training, they can do so on the sam e playing field as everybody else - if they want this data, they can pay to
license it.
That's what I have to do, that's what every other com pany has to do, and that's what they should have to do.
If producing AI grants perm ission to ignore intellectual property rights, then what's to keep a pirate site from  claim ing it exists to 'provide
training data'?
What keeps a pirate from  training a m odel purely to use it as a shield?
The law MUST be fair, or you're just rigging the gam e.
