General Comment
This policy would give com panies vast discretion to use whatever m aterials they like in any way they like. In other words, the IP rights of
all Am ericans are being thrown out the window to let a few com panies chase technological hype.
This will be m assively dam aging to the arts and entertainm ent industries and crush real creativity.
