Advancing U.S. Healthcare: Safer, cheaper, and smarter 
Chronic diseases in America are the leading cause of death and disability affecting 60% 
of the population with 40% having more than one chronic disease and are the leading 
driver of the nation’s $4.1 trillion annual healthcare costs. This is exacerbated by our 
aging population, rising costs of healthcare, administrative burden of providing patient 
care, and healthcare workforce shortage, including doctors, nurses, and other 
professionals. AI is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, offering numerous 
opportunities to improve health outcomes and enhance the efficiency of the healthcare 
workforce. 
Early Detection and Treatment through Diagnostics, Prediction, and Personalization  
AI tools can discover abnormalities in assessments and medical imaging with remarkable 
accuracy and often earlier than human counterparts. Integrated into primary care AI will 
improve health outcomes, save costs for the patient and healthcare system, and prevent 
unnecessary care. Examples include heart failure, cancer, age-related macular 
degeneration, chronic kidney disease, etc. AI algorithms can analyze large volumes of 
data to predict patient outcomes and identify those at higher risk of developing certain 
conditions as well as personalizing treatment plans. This predictive capability allows for 
proactive interventions, potentially preventing diseases before they become severe, such 
as risk of developing opioid dependency, a flare of a chronic disease, mental health crisis, 
etc. Personalized treatment plans are tailored to the patient’s specific needs, enhancing 
the effectiveness of therapies and reducing adverse effects. Combining predictive and 
personalization together, AI can monitor patients’ vital signs in real-time, alerting 
healthcare providers to any concerning changes. This capability is particularly beneficial

professionals’ clinical decision making and collaboration will be optimized while 
workforce management and administrative tasks will be streamlined. Together, this leads 
to efficient and less costly healthcare for patients and systems. 
Drug repurposing 
Drug repurposing is finding new applications for existing drugs to treat other health 
conditions. Instead of developing a new medication from scratch, researchers analyze 
drugs already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for one 
condition and see if they might be effective for another. Developing a new drug is a 
lengthy and expensive process. Drug repurposing can significantly shorten this timeline 
and reduce costs. Much early-stage research is unnecessary because the drugs have 
undergone clinical safety testing. Drug repurposing can accelerate the availability of 
treatments for diseases that lack effective therapies, such as metastatic cancers, 
Alzheimer’s disease and the like. It is also valuable for rare diseases where traditional 
drug development may not be financially viable. Typically, the US FDA approves about 


South Dakota S tate University Page 6 of 14 
March 15, 2025 10% of the new drug applications. However, about 30% of repurposed drugs are 
approved by the FDA. 
Use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug repurposing: Large data sets are available on 
FDA-approved medications, including their chemical structures, interaction targets, 
toxicity, side effects, clearance from the body, interactions with other drugs, and long-
term effects.  AI methods can analyze the available biomedical information, determine 
hidden patterns, and identify potential new uses of one or a mixture of drugs. This 
process can also incorporate genomics and bioinformatics information, patient electronic 
medical records, laboratory test results, and recommend personalized treatment 
approaches. Such individualized treatment regimens will reduce costs, decrease toxicity, 
and increase the efficacy of the drugs. 
AI and drug repurposing for cancer treatment: The use of AI in personalizing cancer 
treatment will significantly advance patient care. By analyzing the available data sets on 
FDA-approved drugs, AI can predict which medications (singly or in combination) 
efficiently target and deactivate the molecules necessary for cancer initiation, 
progression, drug resistance, and metastasis. This increases the likelihood of success in 
clinical trials and enables a new era in individualized, precision oncology. The AI models 
will predict the potential side effects for patients, ensuring that each patient receives a 
treatment plan tailored to their unique needs.   
Challenges in AI-based drug repurposing: All AI models depend on high-quality data sets 
from experiments with sufficient scientific rigor and reproducibility. Subsequently, 
predictions need validation through rigorous experimental testing and clinical trials.  
Finally, adapting existing medications for treating new indications requires approval by 
the US FDA. 
South Dakota State University (SDSU) has the necessary elements in place to lead a wide 
array of partners and stakeholders in using AI to deliver the promise of good health 
throughout the rural heart of America. SDSU will leverage its degree programs that feed 
prepared workforce into multiple health professions, its outreach networks into rural 
communities, and its collaborations with regional universities, and partnerships with three
