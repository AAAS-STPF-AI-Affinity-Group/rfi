General Comment
This is absolutely ridiculous!
It discourages current and future content creators that rely on creative freedom !
AI needs to be regulated for the sake of this god forsaken country! Otherwise, AI will take over everything and itâ€™ll be too late to stop it!
The governm ent should take notes from  the Term inator franchise to understand the consequences of this reckless m otion!
