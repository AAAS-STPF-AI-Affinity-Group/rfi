General Comment
I am  an artist who relies on strong copyright protection to support m y livelihood and, in turn, allow m e to continue to put m oney back into
the econom y through the purchase of m aterials and equipm ent. Allowing AI com panies to utilize m y hard work at zero cost or risk to them
would threaten to put m yself and so m any artists like m e out of a job. Research has shown that there are ethical and legal ways to go
about collecting data to train AI m odels on, and it would not be difficult for these com panies to hold them selves to those standards.
I am  firm ly against any exem ptions to copyright law m ade in the interest of supposed "national security" as they directly harm  countless
hard-working Am ericans like m yself.
