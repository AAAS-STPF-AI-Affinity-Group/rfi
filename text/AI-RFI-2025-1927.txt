General Comment
When defining "the priority policy actions needed to sustain and enhance Am erica's AI dom inance, and [ensuring] that unnecessarily
burdensom e requirem ents do not ham per private sector AI innovation," keep in m ind that private sector AI "innovation," unless carefully
regulated, will include gallons of AI snake oil produced by greedy businesses eager to fleece the public, while gobbling up and abusing
intellectual property of m illions of Am ericans skim m ed from  the internet. This is akin to crim inals who m ight fraudulently steal $1.00 from
hundreds of thousands of bank accounts without notice. 
Real benefits from  m achine learning, such as in m edical diagnosis, are not based on data gathered indiscrim inately.
Data worth using for creating an AI m odel worth creating and valuable enough to m ake m oney for the business is worth paying for, and
it's the only way to prevent abuses by such com panies.
