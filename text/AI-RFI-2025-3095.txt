General Comment
AI has no place in the future of the U. S. It is a scam  that steals the hard work of Am erican artists to feed algorithm s that pum p out
hom ogeneous slop. This is not only an affront to art, but a threat to the inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness. Furtherm ore, it
threatens to turn the Internet from  the greatest collection of hum an knowledge into a cesspool of unintelligible slop.
At the m ost charitable, these com panies developing AI are responsible for following the sam e laws as everyone else. If Am erica is going
to com m it to the folly of treating com panies like people, then they are beholden to the very sam e laws. If anything, they should be held to
m ore regulations, not less, as they are capable of worse treatm ent of our people than any individual. I will not accept this sort of flagrant
favoritism  from  a governm ent that claim s to lead the free nation, and I am  far from  alone.
Do not give corporations m ore freedom  than the very people you claim  to represent. For a lack of representation in governm ent was the
very reason our forefathers separated from  England and European powers, and such desire for freedom  and representation still runs in our
veins.
