To Whom it May Concern,
Generative AI is automated theft. Any economic benefit you think it will have in the shortterm will greatly outweigh the harm it will cause in the long term. It will cost jobs, destroylivelihoods, and wreak havoc across the economy. Please reign in this out of control industrybefore it gobbles up all resources and jobs and spits out heartless slop.Greg Manke
