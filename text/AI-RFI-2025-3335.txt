General Comment
I am  firm ly against this m otion. AI does nothing but stifle creativity, disincentive people who are truly skilled and creative from  posting their
works online, and give m alicious actors the perfect tool to spread disinform ation. As som eone who specializes in Machine Learning I think
there are a lot of great possibilities for AI, but only if it can be developed with proper regulations and strong rules on what data can and
canâ€™t be used to train it.
