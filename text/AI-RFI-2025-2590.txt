General Comment
I’ve been a freelance illustrator and sole proprietor in the lucrative gam ing industry for alm ost 20 years, and i think AI m ust be regulated to
a large extent when it com es to IP infringem ent. 
I like m any other of m y colleagues have had m y work “scraped” and included in Midjourney and other generative AI program s without
our consent or com pensation. These com panies take our work and train their AI m odels on it, claim  the action is fair use, and then seek to
copyright each new AI im age. This is not fair use. 
Ive never been asked, consulted, signed or been included in any discussion, agreem ent, or contract regarding an AI Corporate entity and
the use of m y personal or professional work. This is just bad business, as generative AI will im pinge and supress a very lucrative creative
field (graphic designers, illustrators, com m ercial artists) of rich talented tax payers and replace it with cheap (and crappy) knockoffs. 
Please protect the artists and creatives of Am erica from  the corporations who only seek to drain our talent and leave us workless and
consequently penniless, i think we have and do offer m uch to our governm ent and our businesses. We are all sm all businessm en and
wom en, and sm all businesses are the heart and soul of Am erica, please protect us and regulate generative AI to protect our personal,
professional, and original IP work.
Thankyou for your tim e.
