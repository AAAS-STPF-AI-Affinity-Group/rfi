Hello,
My name is Pepin, and I'm an artist in the US. I've recently left all social media connected
with Meta after the quality of the algorithm and user interactions went downhill noticeablydownhill. (This would have been around spring of 2024). I do not monetize my art and I haveno interest in making my art a career, however, I do fear the greed and laziness of certaincorporate oligarchs who seek to steal as much value as
 possible from living, breathing
humans, especially my artist and writer friends who seek to make a living in a market nowdominated by AI. Social media platforms are making it harder than ever to opt out of yourposted content being fed to AI. AI art and writing, even when fed the best that humans haveavailable, is easily discerned by the trained eye. It looks subpar because it's a machine learningtool's best approximation of creation. It's a program, not an artist, and most importantly to theultra-rich who seek to expand it, it doesn't need a paycheck. To whoever may read thiscomment, if you choose to side with the working American people, please do all in yourpower to resist federal and corporate overreach into our livelihoods. Keep AI protections inplace. Thank you.
