Re: Reque st for Informa�on on the Development of an Ar�ﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Ac�on Plan  
Mr. D’So uza, 
Vanderbil t University is grateful for the opportunity to provide input on implementa�on of 
President Trump’s Execu�ve Order 14179 , “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in 
Ar�ﬁcial Intelligence .” We agree with the goals of “sustaining and enhancing America's AI 
dominance in order to promote human ﬂourishing, economic compe��veness, and na�onal security. ” To address these challenges, we recommend a three- fold approach:  
1.AI in the Clear: the AI Ac�on Plan  must preserve access to robust AI resources for the
researchers  who will drive much of the innova�on in AI and AI applica�ons.
2.Digital  & AI Literacy : the AI Ac�on Plan needs to ensure all Americans can understand,
develop skills for, and ac�vely par�cipate in shaping the development and use of AI
technologies to beneﬁt their communi�es.
3.Building on AI -ready Infrastructure : the AI Ac�on Plan should enable  the research,
development, and technology transfer  needed to deploy  innova�ve AI -powered
solu�ons that address some of our most pressing na�onal priori�es , including na�onal
security, healthcare  outcomes, educa�on and training, and transporta�on.
Global AI c ompe��on is accelera�ng and the implica�ons for our na�onal security and 
prosperity could not be greater. AI has the poten�al to completely upend a wide range of ﬁelds; 
medicine, manufacturing, transporta�on , biosecurity, cybersecurity and more will change as a 
result of AI. To ensure the U .S. is both ready for these changes and leading the charge, it is 
essen�al to have a whole of government approach that u�lizes the public -private partnerships  
that have been so successful throughout our na�on’s history. Programs at Vanderbilt University 
leverage funding from internal funding streams and federal sources such as the Na�onal Science 
Founda�on, Dept. of Energy, Dept. of Defense, Na�onal Ins�tutes of Health, Dept. of Educa�on , 


and Dept. of Transporta�on . We believe it is essen�al for these and other research agencies to 
be encouraged to engage in AI research.  
AI in the Clear  
To avoid being leapfrogged by other countries, America needs a range of research programs in 
AI. Deep Seek and other similar startup companies have demonstrated that even modest 
infrastructure can produce impressive results in genera�ve AI. Without con�nued research in this area, America is at risk of being “in the dark” when it comes to an�cipa� ng the AI advances 
of other countries. We recommend OSTP enable programs at all federal research agencies on  a 
range of AI -related subjects, including :  
•Founda�onal AI algorithms and techniques,
•Interdisciplinary AI applica�ons,
•Responsible and trustworthy AI,
•AI ethics and human impacts, and
•The future of AI.
A key elem ent to suppor�ng these research programs is robust AI r esources , including access 
to exis�ng large language models  and the compu� ng capability  and data necessary for the 
further advancement of AI . To address the former, Vanderbilt became  one of the ﬁrst 
universi�es to provide its students, staﬀ, and faculty access to custom genera�ve AI so�ware; our version is called Amplify. Amplify is Vanderbilt University's internal genera�ve AI pla�orm that leverages the same technology behind ChatGPT and similar AI models. It oﬀers a secure environment, ensuring that data and chat histories remain private and protected within Vanderbilt's internal inf rastructure.  Amplify also allows the user to easily toggle between 
exis�ng large language models and beneﬁt from the unique capabili�es and strengths of each. With the Amplify program, Vanderbilt University is not just responding to the rapid advancemen ts in AI, it is taking proac�ve steps to integrate these technologies in a meaningful 
way.  We are also looking for ways to collaborate  with other ins�tu�ons of higher educa�on, to 
ensure their students, staﬀ, and faculty have access to these tools. The AI Ac�on Plan sh ould 
consider mechanisms  to scale up these ac�vi�es .  
The fe deral government is currently suppor�ng eﬀorts to provide the computa�onal, data, 
so�ware, model, training and user support resources necessary for the further advancement of AI through the Na�onal AI Research Resource (NAIRR) managed by the Na�onal Science Founda�on . NAIRR is a partnership with 12 other federal agencies and 26 non -governmental 
partners that makes available government -funded, industry , and other contributed resources in 
support of the na�on's research and educa�on community.  NAIRR was originally recommended 
by a task force that formed as a result of the Na�onal AI Ini�a�ve Act of 2020 (Public Law No: 116- 283), which President Trump signed into law in January 2021. The eﬀort to establish NAIRR
had similar mo�va�ons as EO 14179 – the need to improve America’s AI capabili�es to ensure
the U.S. remains the leader in this technology.  We urge the  AI Ac�on Plan to priori�ze support
for NAIRR  and robustly fund this important program .


OSTP should ensure the AI Ac�on Plan allows researchers to push the boundaries of 
founda�onal machine learning algorithms and architectures. Vanderbilt researchers are 
leveraging federal funding from agencies such as the Na�onal Science Founda�on, Dept. of 
Energy,  and Dept. of Defense  to advanc e the state -of-the-art in core AI technologies, such as 
machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision. The public -
private partnership is essen�al for furthering innova�on; a few examples of this partnership in 
ac�on at Vanderbilt include:  
• Explor ing novel neural network designs, op�miza�on techniques, and learning 
paradigms to create more powerful, robust, and eﬃcient AI models.  
• Advancing the capabili�es of language models, enabling beter understanding, and 
genera�on of human language could lead to signiﬁcant improvements in applica�ons 
like intelligent assistants, automated transla�on, and text analysis.  
• Understanding  AI’s impact of physical systems , such as surgical robots  and AI -enabled 
medical devices,  and working to ensure these systems are trustworthy.  
• Developing more accurate and versa�le visual percep�on systems , which involve s 
enhancing object recogni�on, scene understanding, and image/video analysis to support applica�ons in areas like autonomous systems, medical imaging, and surveillance.  
 
Perhaps more important than the contribu�ons of any one ﬁeld is the importance of the AI 
Ac�on Plan suppor�ng interdisciplinary collabora�ons. We have found that interdisciplinary 
collabora�ons are a key ingredient in taking the advancements of an individual discipline 
through to a real -world applica�on. AI has vast poten�al to address complex real- world 
challenge s, however, w ithout interdisciplinary collabora�ons, we will struggle to apply these 
technologies in novel domains . To enable these collabora�ons at Vanderbilt, we have launched 
the Vanderbilt Lab for Immersive AI Transla�on (VALIANT ), which  serves as a center of gravity 
for strategic na�onal partnerships and engagement in AI. It will be important for the AI Ac�on 
Plan to facilitate similar collabora�ons across federal agencies and the wide range of disciplines they support . At Vanderbilt, we  use internal funds to support innova�ve projects that leverage 
genera�ve AI to solve problems in areas like healthcare, educa�on, and resource eﬃciency. By ﬁnding similar mechanisms to support this kind of  collabora�on , the federal government  can 
foster the cross -pollina�on of ideas and techniques across diﬀerent domains of AI.  
Digital  & AI Literacy  
American talent is an essen�al component in winning the global AI compe��on . The AI Ac�on 
Plan must include programs suppor�ng the development of AI skills and knowledge across a wide range of stakeholders , from current college students to the exis�ng workforce and even K -
12 students and teachers.  In his EO 13859
, signed in February 2019, President Trump said a key 
principle of the American AI Ini�a�ve need ed to be training “current and future genera�ons of 
American workers with the skills to develop and apply AI technologies to prepare them for today's economy and jobs of the future.”  
 Providing upskilling and reskilling opportuni�es for the current workforce to keep pace with 
the rapidly evolving ﬁeld of AI  is essen�al . Vanderbilt’s experience in this area is primarily 


through our rela�onship  with online learning pla�orms like Coursera to oﬀer a variety of AI-
focused courses and professional cer�ﬁcates . We have seen ample interest in these courses, 
which  allow s working professionals to develop new AI -related skills and competencies.  Based on 
this experience, we hope a n AI Ac�on Plan would iden�fy  mechanisms to scale such eﬀorts.  
Vanderb ilt is also ac�vely preparing the next genera�on of AI prac��oners and leaders 
through its academic program s. Each federal agency has a role to play in educa�ng these 
students and preparing them with the AI skills that will support th e agencies’ speciﬁc needs. At 
Vanderbilt, through funding and partnership agreements with DOD – including NSA  – and 
industry, our Ins�tute of Na�onal Security is immersing students across campus in AI 
experien�al learning, and our students are discovering new so lu�ons to the na�on’s most 
pressing challenges like cybersecurity. T he Vanderbilt AI Law Lab  is leveraging internal funding 
to provide law students with hands -on experience in applying AI and machine learning to legal 
challenges.  The university's newly launched Ins�tute for the Advancement of Higher Educa�on 
(AdvancED) is redeﬁning the faculty and student experience, integra�ng AI and other emerging 
technologies across the curriculum to ensure graduates are well -equipped to thrive in an AI -
powered workforce.  AdvanceED experts  are supported by the Na�onal Science Founda�on, 
Ins�tute for Educa�on Sciences, Na�onal Ins�tutes of Health, and more.  
Building on AI -ready Infrastructure  
To maximize the poten�al of AI, the AI Ac�on Plan may need to  establish a process by which the 
federal government determines the sectors, ﬁelds, or applica�ons that can most beneﬁt from 
federal resources. The key goal is  to deploy innova�ve AI -powered solu�ons that address some 
of the most pressing na�onal priori�es.  While our researchers are exploring a wide range of 
applica�on areas, the ones we believe are primed to beneﬁt most and quickly from AI are:  
•Strengthening Na�onal Security and Defense : Vanderbilt's AI researchers are
collabora�ng with government and military partners to explore how these technologiescan be used to enhance situa�onal awareness, decision- making, and mission planning in
na�onal security and defense contexts.
•Improving Healthcare Outcomes and Access : Vanderbilt researchers are leveraging AI to
enhance medical diagnosis, treatment planning, and pa�ent monitoring. This includesdeveloping AI systems that can analyze medical imaging data and electronic healthrecords to provide clinicians with more acc urate and personalized insights.
•Enhancing Educa�on and Training : AI-powered adap�ve learning pla�orms and virtual
tutors are being explored at Vanderbilt to personalize the educa�onal experience andimprove learning outcomes for students of all ages. Addi�onally, the university isinves�ga�ng how AI can be used to create more engaging and eﬀec�ve professionaldevelopment opportuni�es for teachers.
•Eﬃcient use of Exis�ng Infrastructure : Vanderbilt is applying AI to the challenge of
managing complex transporta�on systems and infrastructure, such as using computervision and predic�ve analy�cs to improve traﬃc ﬂow, op�mize public transit routes,reduce pedestrian incidents and fata li�es, and enhance asset management. Vanderbilt
researchers are developing and applying AI to analyze and manage cri�cal infrastructure


(e.g., power, water) risk and improve their reliability and resilience through data -driven 
and analy�cal approaches  
 
In addi�on to suppor�ng the research that results in innova�ve technologies, OSTP will need to  
ensure there are suﬃcient pathways and support mechanisms to translate that research. At Vanderbilt, VALIANT has submited nine patents since it was established seven months ago. This 
success rate is due in large part to the support structure Vanderbilt has for such technology transfer eﬀorts through our Center for Technology Transfer & Commercializa�on and The 
Wond’ry programs.  These programs leverage fede ral support from the Na�onal Science 
Founda�on and the Small Business Innova�on Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology 
Transfer (STTR) programs  at most federal research agencies.  
 
Underlying all these applica�on -oriented eﬀorts should be a  steadfast commitment to 
con�nued basic, fundamental, and curiosity -driven AI research . The federal government is 
uniquely situated to s upport basic AI research ; even the founda�ons of our current AI tools 
were developed at universi�es with the support of federal funding.  By inves�ng in the 
advancement of core AI technologies and techniques, we ensure a strong founda�on for developing innova�ve and impac�ul solu�ons that address real -world problems and create a 
beter future for all.  
 It will also be important for the AI Ac�on Plan to be centered on ensuring the ethical and 
responsible development of AI systems . At the core of this point is a commitment – as 
President Trump said in EO 13859
 – “to shaping the global evolu�on of AI in a manner 
consistent with our Na�on's values, policies, and priori�es.”  One of the principles he laid out in 
the EO was to “foster public trust and conﬁdence in AI technologies and protect civil liber�es, 
privacy, and American values in their applica�on in order to fully realize the poten�al of AI 
technologies for the American people.”  At Vanderbilt, researchers are working towards the 
goals of public trust in AI by exploring topics such as algorithm limita�ons , explainable AI, and 
the societal impacts of these technologies : 
• Algorithms with Limited Training Data: Vanderbilt researchers are ac�vely working to 
iden�fy and mi�gate algorithmic limita�ons , when AI systems are required to make 
decisions that are based on limited training sets . This is essen�al for building trust in AI 
and ensuring that decisions are in line with human expecta�ons . 
• Privacy and Data Rights : Protec�ng individual privacy and data rights is a paramount 
concern. Vanderbilt is exploring technical and policy solu�ons to safeguard sensi�ve user 
informa�on throughout the AI system lifecycle.  
• Keeping Human s in Charge : While AI has immense poten�al to augment and empower 
human capabili�es, it is cri�cal that humans retain meaningful oversight and decision -
making authority. Vanderbilt is studying ways to preserve human oversight in AI -
powered systems  while taking advantage of its poten�al to increase eﬃciency and save 
resources . 


•Evalua�ng AI’s Impact  on America: Vanderbilt recognizes the need to thoroughly assess
the broader market impacts of AI deployment. Interdisciplinary research in this area can
help policymakers and stakeholders make informed decisions that promote the common
good , advance America’s compe��veness, and ensure preserva�on of na�onal security .
In clos ing, we would point to President Trump’s 2019 EO on AI , when he said “The United States 
must drive technological breakthroughs in AI across the Federal Government, industry, and 
academia in order to promote scien�ﬁc discovery, economic compe��veness, and na�onal security.”  We agree that this principle, as well as the others listed out in that EO, is s�ll relevant 
today. His EO went on to say we must “Promote sustained investment in AI R&D in collabora�on 
with industry, academia, interna�onal partners and allies, and other non -Federal en��es to 
generate technological breakthroughs in AI and related technologies and to rapidly transi�on those breakthroughs into capabili�es that contribute to our economic and na�onal security.” We fully agree with the need for sustained  investment and con�nued public -private 
partnerships  to sustain and enhance America's AI dominance .  
We apprec iate the opportunity to provide input to  the AI Ac�on Plan that OSTP was charged 
with developing in EO 14179 . Please let us know what addi�onal informa�on or support we can 
provide .
