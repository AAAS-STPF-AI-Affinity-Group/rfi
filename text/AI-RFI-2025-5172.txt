General Comment
Holy s&^% do not do th is. If  copyri ght can’t stop AI theft then  nothing can. The genie won’t go back in the bottle. 
Copyri ght is a legal mechan ism  to protect authorsh ip, and the entire poi nt of  th is tech nology is to circu mvent the need for 
creators. They’re def initional ly incompatible! Do not let this part of  govern ment be sold out to the tech  barons that are 
trying to com modify our f uture.
