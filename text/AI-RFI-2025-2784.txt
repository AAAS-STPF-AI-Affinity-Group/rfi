General Comment
The only thing that should be done with this policy is to tear it up. Copyright law is im perfect but critical to artists, creatives, engineers,
inventors, and creators of all types. Rem oving protections to fuel useless AI technology is a sure way to set Am erican ingenuity and
productivity back generations.
