General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States.
AI steals from  m y livelihood and m y industry as a United States citizen and artist, and actively profits off of that theft by swindling stupid
investors into bankrolling technology that isn’t even what it claim s to be. It’s not artificial intelligence, it is statistical m odeling designed to
invent inform ation based off of previous data it has taken in, it isn’t sentient, it m akes no decisions and has no agency, and proponents
who claim  otherwise greatly m isrepresent what the technology can do or how it can be used to protect the interests of Am erican citizens
or Am erican capital.
And if the goal here is to rem ove the “guardrails”, otherwise known as copyright law, then the governm ent is sanctioning not only the theft
of individuals copyrighted m aterial and intellectual property, but the intellectual property of corporate Am erica.
