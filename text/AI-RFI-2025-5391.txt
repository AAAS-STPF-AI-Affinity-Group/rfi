General Comment
The proposed action am ounts to theft of intellectual property on a vast scale, to support a group of com panies that are engaged in
outrageous grifting. The "AI dom inance" referred to in this executive order is a worthless goal, and if im plem ented would be a security
breach of Am erican assets on an unprecedented scale.
I can't believe anyone is seriously considering this.
