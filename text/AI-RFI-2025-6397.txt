General Comment
As a visual artist, I think this action will severely m ake it harder to push m y work beyond just personal use, in fact it would even hurt m y
work that is for personal use considering it can always be taken to m ake som ething AI-generated "art". I think it's a serious m atter to
consider when it com es to using AI-generated content as footage for "news" as it can easily can be used for m isinform ation and creating
conflict.
