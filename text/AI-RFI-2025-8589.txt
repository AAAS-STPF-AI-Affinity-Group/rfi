General Comment
A product that relies on theft to sustain itself is not a product worth investing in. It is no different than the IP theft that our adversaries
engage in, only weâ€™re asking the Am erican public to allow it to be done to ourselves. 
Sam  Altm an and his ilk have created a business m odel that is unsustainable in num erous ways and they are petitioning the governm ent to
allow them  to prolong the bilking of investors and the general public and to buy them  tim e to figure out a way to turn a profit. They are
stealing the art, inform ation, and intellectual output of m illions of great Am erican m inds for financial gain. Their product threatens the job
security of hundreds of m illions of Am erican workers which m ake up the bulk of the consum er class in this country. AI m akes this country
no sm arter, no m ore advanced, and no m ore secure. In fact, it will do exactly the opposite of that.
