General Comment
I do not support AI in any form . AI is a threat to people's livelihoods in the short term  and our continued existence in the long term . There
is no way that further developing AI will help hum anity. This will only end in the quality of life worsening, not getting better. This m ust be
stopped now.
Artists deserve to be com pensated for their contributions to society. AI kills real jobs.
If m ajor decisions are to be m ade in the favor of AI, dem ocracy and the People should be the ones to m ake that decision- not the
President, the President's Adm inistration, or any corporate entity.
