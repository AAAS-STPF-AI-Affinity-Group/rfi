General Comment
I am  writing as a United States citizen, an artist and a concerned individual with a stake in the future of the various creative industries that
stand to suffer if com panies like OpenAI continue to operate with flagrant disregard for intellectual property rights and basic hum an
creativity. I em phatically oppose the developm ent and im plem entation of generative AI, particularly in the form  in which these com panies
present it. 
By their own adm ission, the com panies behind these technologies require the legalized theft of untold num bers of copyrighted m aterials in
order to continue operating. This is an unacceptable requirem ent, and acquiescing to their dem and to effectively ignore all intellectual
property rights, up to and including copyright, in the nam e of som e ill-defined and overprom ised future growth would be a heinous
overreach and a devastating blow to every working creative in the country. Generative AI is not som e m agic thinking com puter — it’s
plagiarism  with extra steps, and it has no place in any serious discussion about the future of the Am erican econom y. 
Instead of dealing a horrible blow to every creative industry in the country, consider instead sim ply choosing NOT to dism antle copyright.
AI is not sustainable, and it is not the future.
