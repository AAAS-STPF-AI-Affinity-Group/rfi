General Comment
AI is an incredibly ecological destructive and wasteful process. It also steals jobs from  people and does them  less well. I donâ€™t want to
pay for their unem ploym ent benefits AND have to have their job done less well by a m achine. I want people to be able to feed their
fam ilies.
