General Comment
Creative Works are owned by the Creators of that work and AI being trained on that work is violation of Copyright at trem endous scale,
being trem endously crim inal. 
If AI com panies are to use the creative works of another, in a way that generates profit for them selves, they m ust follow the Copyright.
And profiting off of their work is clealry not “fair use” 
AI com panies can use all the works in the public dom ain as there is nothing the governem nt can do to restrict that. The fact that the
generated works based on the public dom ain will be “out of date” is fair and practical and allows “m odern” creative works to m aintain
their legally intended dom inance of the m arket. This is healthy com pletion that doesn’t violate Copyright and uses the Public Dom ain as
intended. 
Works generated by a generative AI should not be copyrightable. 
* AI scraping of.of copyrighted works steals from  livelihoods of Am ericans and profits off of theft
* generative AI is overhyped
* generative AI creating profit steels jobs from  citizens. generative AI therefore m andates the creation of Universal Basic Incom e to
ensure that citizens are com pensated for the destruction of our livelihoods on an enorm ous scale,
