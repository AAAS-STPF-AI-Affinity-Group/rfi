General Comment
As a working Am erican, I worry about big tech abusing AI to cut jobs from  Am ericans who are already struggling to find and keep work.
AI should not be allowed to be used in professions in which a hum an can safely
do the work. We have already seen the dam age AI has done last year, when 14% of lay offs was related to AI. 
I have been affected by AI in m y work place as I now need governm ent aid just to be able to m ake it by.
I want to be able to support m yself and big tech and corporations abusing AI have m ade it far harder.
Please do not allow AI to lead to an unem ploym ent crisis.
