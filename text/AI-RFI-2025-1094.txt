General Comment
I have been playing with ChatGBT for about a year and have done som e very cool things with it. I asked it to sort m y iPhone phots by
facial recognition, I have used it to enhance m y resum es, write perform ance reviews and draft policy docum entation. That being said, I
have also worked with it to create a database from  webpages, and found that the data was roughly 70% accurate, probably because of
the way the web pages are built. So I think in the beginning stages, you are going to need people like m e with strong analytical skills to
keep it honest. I also think there needs to be people who work with it to enhance its sill learning on ethics. I am  grateful to the President
for taking away som e of the red tape, but we are going to need an Arm y of volunteers or people that will continue to work with it, and be
able to advise of course corrections when we discover som ething.
