General Comment
Granting any AI com pany the right to profit off m y identity or m y work without m y consent is absolutely appalling and a direct assault on
m y civil liberties. No com pany has the right to encroach upon these liberties weather it be in the nam e of corporate profits or technological
advancem ent. Any such actions taken by any governing body, corporation, or private citizen are open to judicial process. If we are to
uphold any assem blance of a constitutional dem ocracy then we m ust allow any venture such as AI technology to rem ain withholden to the
process within that system .
