General Comment
The current "industry leaders" are stealing trillions of dollars worth of assets from  real creative people and spending billions in
com putational costs in order to develop tools for which vanishingly few people even find any utility. These charlatans are looking to leave
the public and governm ent leadership on the hook for untold billions of dollars in exchange for products that sim ply aren't wanted or
useful, on top of being m assive, unabashed theft. With these people at the helm , we are both going to lose the "AI War" and dram atically
dim inish the United States' cultural footprint with a panoply of sloppy, slapdash nonsense that will displace real Am erican talent : the very
talent whose fruits these people MUST steal in order to create their silly products.
The real way to com e out ahead in the "AI Wars" is to fund serious, broad-spectrum  research in com putational and m aterials science that
can drive authentic advancem ents in the products that private com panies are able to offer, rather than the current hegem ony's strategy of
putting lipstick on a pig and calling it the next great Am erican beauty. This research should be both private and academ ic, but I am
concerned that both private practice and universities are getting the short end of the stick in the current political landscape. We need a
serious course correction, because right now we are going to fall very, very far behind in the real fight.
