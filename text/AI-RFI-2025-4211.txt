General Comment
Do not pass this. This sort of thing m esses with a lot of people's livelihoods. AI is a sick trend that steals from  people that actually put
forward effort and work to get better at a skill or a job. Its a trend that will not last. 
Sim ply put it will ruin jobs. It will ruin creative expression. Traditional art, Digital art, m usic, actors that play parts in m ovies, voice actors,
and m any other creative positions will suffer or even be wiped out entirely. These people put countless hours and days into their craft. To
have it robbed by som eone who can sim ply 'generate' som ething rem otely equal is som ething that has no place in the creative industry.
Not only that, but it will be able to re-create people's likenesses, voices, and identities. People will notice. 
I know a lot of people think AI generation seem s pleasing or approachable because a m achine does whatever you want and its easy to
do. However, it takes away the hum an soul behind hard-earned skills and work. It will never be accepted as anything it sets out to
'replace'. 
Do not forget the skilled hands that wish to test them selves, create wonderful pieces of self-expression, and have spent years getting there.
