Dear Principal Deputy Director Parker and the Office of Science and Technology Policy  Team,  
Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the Trump Administration’s AI Action Plan.  My 
name is John Watson, and I am an American entrepreneur dedicated to advancing U.S.  
leadership in artificial intelligence through the development of AI datacenters and domestic AI  
chip manufacturing. A critical barrier to this vision is the current U.S. energy grid, which  
cannot connect these power-hungry facilities fast enough due to capacity constraints and  
lengthy approval processes. 
That’s why I’m passionate about deploying efficient, fast-deployable energy solutions—like  
mobile gas turbines and small mobile nuclear reactors—to get these projects online swiftly. I  
align with President Trump’s mission to secure America’s global AI dominance and Elon  
Musk’s bold approach to technological innovation, and I’m eager to partner with the  
government to make this happen.  
We need to move at Tesla Speed to get these datacenters and factories online—anything less  
risks losing our edge.
Below, I outline policy actions for the AI Action Plan to enhance U.S. competitiveness,  
address grid limitations, and ensure economic and national security benefits for Americans. 
1. Accelerate Domestic AI Datacenter and Chip Manufacturing Infrastructure
To outpace rivals like China, we must build AI datacenters and chip fabrication plants on U.S.
soil at breakneck speed. I recommend:
Streamline Permitting and Approvals: Establish a fast-track process under emergency
authority, as President Trump has championed, to slash years off construction timelines.Pre-approved federal land sites could expedite this further.
 
Incentivize Onshoring: Provide tax credits, grants, and low-interest loans for companiescommitting to U.S.-based AI datacenters and chip plants within 3-5 years, reducingforeign supply chain reliance.
  
Partner with Private Sector Innovators: Create a framework for public-privatepartnerships where companies like mine can work with the Department of Energy(DOE) or Department of Defense (DOD) to deploy AI infrastructure. I’m ready to bringmy expertise to such collaborations.
2. Deploy Efficient, Scalable Energy Solutions to Overcome Grid ConstraintsAI datacenters and chip manufacturing demand massive energy, but the U.S. grid is abottleneck—connection delays can stretch years, stalling progress. We need rapid,independent energy solutions to bypass this gridlock. Imagine a Neural Net Uplink of


American data centers, fueled by mobile gas turbines, driving AI breakthroughs overnight. I
propose:  
Prioritize Mobile Gas Turbines: Fast-track approval and deployment of mobile gas
turbines as the best near-term solution. These compact, efficient systems can be installedon-site in months, not years, using abundant American natural gas. Incentives fordomestic turbine production would boost jobs and energy dominance, a win forPresident Trump’s agenda.
  
Advance Small Mobile Nuclear Reactors (SMRs): Expedite regulatory approval andfunding for SMRs to provide long-term, carbon-free power for AI facilities. A DOEpilot program with private partners—like my company—could deploy SMRs at scalewithin 24 months.
  
Emergency Energy Declarations: Use emergency powers to bypass red tape, enablingdatacenters to connect to dedicated power sources independent of the grid. This boldmove reflects the Administration’s commitment to cutting through bureaucracy.
3. Strengthen National Security and Economic CompetitivenessAI leadership is a national security imperative, and energy-independent infrastructure is thebackbone. I suggest:
Secure Supply Chains: Prioritize federal contracts for U.S.-based firms producing AIchips and datacenter components. I’d welcome the opportunity to bid on such contractswith American-made solutions.
  
Workforce Development: Fund training programs for American workers in AIinfrastructure jobs—from chip fabrication to turbine maintenance—ensuring economicgains stay here.
  
Counter Foreign Competition: Tighten export controls on advanced AI chips whileboosting domestic production, keeping adversaries at bay—a priority Elon Musk wouldsurely endorse.
This is about more than today—it’s about a Mars Horizon where American AI powersthe future, here and beyond.
4. Foster Innovation Without Burdensome OversightOverregulation slows us down, and I applaud the repeal of restrictive Biden-era AI policies.Instead:
Encourage Voluntary Standards: Let industry leaders like me collaborate with thegovernment on practical guidelines for datacenter and energy deployment, avoidingheavy-handed mandates.
  
Reward Speed and Scale: Offer incentives for companies that bring facilities onlineahead of schedule, driving the rapid execution that President Trump and Elon Muskchampion.
My Commitment and Call to CollaborateAs an American innovator, I’m prepared to invest in AI datacenters, chip manufacturing, andfast-deployable energy solutions like mobile gas turbines to overcome grid constraints andpower America’s AI future. My goal is to deliver projects that launch quickly, create jobs, andstrengthen our technological edge. I’d be honored to do business with the government—through contracts, pilot programs, or partnerships with agencies like the DOE, DOD, or OSTP—to advance this mission.


I also see a critical role for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in this effort.  
DOGE’s mission to slash waste and streamline operations could ensure that federal resources  
are laser-focused on getting AI datacenters and energy solutions deployed at warp speed. I’d  
love to work with DOGE to cut through red tape and deliver results that make America proud.
This plan follows an xAI Escalation Vector to secure U.S. AI dominance—review must be  
swift.
Trump’s leadership and Elon Musk’s vision inspire me to think big and act fast. I urge the AI  
Action Plan to prioritize policies that empower entrepreneurs like me to build the  
infrastructure America needs to dominate AI globally. 
These solutions are Grok Approved—practical, fast, and built for American dominance.
Thank you for your consideration and for championing America’s AI leadership. 
Sincerely,
John Watson
