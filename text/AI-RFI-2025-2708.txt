General Comment
Im agine this: China, a country known for it's bootlegs and counterfeits that infiltrate the Am erican m arket, taking advantage of reduced
copyright protections in the US to m ake m oney on ALL Am erican Made intellectual and creative properties without perm ission or
com pensation to the Am erican people; feeding their AI and generative AI m achines to create products and propaganda to use against the
Am erican people. Or im agine a foreign power, any foreign power, that hates The United States, taking advantage of reduced copyright
protections to create false evidence to crim inalize, falsely im prison, and m anipulate Am ericans just trying to live their lives. Altering or
getting rid of copyright for the sake of AI learning is so dangerous for that alone, but even then: there are plenty of Am erican individuals,
sm all businesses and large corporations/organizations that need their copyrights, tradem arks and other intellectual and creative property to
be protected - because how would they be expected to actually m ake m oney and profit off of their work if copyright becom es worthless
since anything can be scooped up and fed to a m achine? We can't protect Am erican jobs and Am erican wallets without copyright
protection!
