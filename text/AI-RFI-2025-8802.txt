General Comment
Why is it when people want to use licensed IPs for their livestream s there's the DMCA but when AI com panies want to m ake AI slop
using the sam e things, it's com pletely fine? Nothing done with generative AI will ever m ake the world a better place. Considering we are
under the Trum p adm inistration though, I know they don't care about that.
