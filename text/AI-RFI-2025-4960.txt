General Comment
AI m ay have its purposes but it should not and cannot be allowed to just outright steal the m aterials used to train it. Not only do people
and businesses work hard to produce actual work that AI sim ply copies without understanding it or it's m eaning, but it also causes
m onetary harm  and harm  to the developm ent of AI as well. If private businesses are not paying to use work to train AI, they are not
encouraging anyone to produce anything to train the AI. An AI trained only on AI generated m aterials fan only produce worse and worse
m aterial forever, m ore slop without any sort of actual benefit.
