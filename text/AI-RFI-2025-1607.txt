General Comment
Generative AI as a technology has been rushed out into production with no thought as to ethics or the vast am ount of harm  it's done both
environm entally and technologically. Every com pany suddenly needs to jam  generative AI tech in everything, slowing program s to a crawl.
Internet search engines have becom e a practically unusable m ess with generative AI articles taking up the bulk of the top search results
(usually filled with vast am ounts of m isinform ation), and generated im agery crowding out real photos and artwork on im age searches.
These data m odels were trained with stolen data across the board, with no com pensation given to the original artists and authors. They
claim  they cannot even exist if they were forced to perform  lawfully and ethically, so instead they're trying to dem and the laws be changed
to accom m odate them  at the expense of everyone this rushed, half-assed cash grab has harm ed. We need to take a big step back and
reexam ine the technology of LLMs and generative im ages from  the ground up, and figure out a way that it can be im plem ented with fair
com pensation to the people whose works are used to train the m odels, and hopefully reverse the im m ense dam age done to the form erly
useful internet.
