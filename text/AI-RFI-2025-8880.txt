General Comment
Hey! As a writer and artist, AI text and im age generating program s actively cause harm , have been proven to have no m onetary value,
and generally have no use due to the fact that m any now know how to spot such things and consider com panies and products that use it to
be worthless garbage.
This also has devastating effects, especially considering copyright, for artists and writers who can only m ake m oney through what they
m ake. There is no reason to keep AI text and im age generation around legally, especially considering m any com panies that use it have
stated that they are specifically using it for the negative affects it causes.
