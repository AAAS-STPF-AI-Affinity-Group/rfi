General Comment
Artificial intelligence as an industry, particularly so-called generative AI, relies so heavily on the theft of intellectual property that its
lum inaries freely adm it that their businesses will collapse unless they're given the leeway to steal that intellectual property. No business
deserves to flourish through theft. What artificial intelligence needs is m ore regulation, not less.
