General Comment
AI should not use data without perm ission from  the creators of that data. This is stealing from  creators. AI can still operate using public
dom ain creations. Com puters should not have special freedom  to steal when hum ans are bound by law. Am erica is a world leader in
creativity, we do not need to resort to regurgitation. We should not be churning out poorly done, cheap bootleg copies that sham e our
country's fam ed artists and creatives. Let us lead instead of follow. Thank you.
