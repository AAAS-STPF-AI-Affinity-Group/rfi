General Comment
AI is a technology based on theft. Theft of livelihood of artists, theft of hum an connection and condition. Ripping off ideas, im ages,
language put forward by real thinking m inds in order to produce em pty and derivative content just to m axim ize a profit is short-term
thinking. It will lead to fewer jobs, hollow culture, and less innovation. It will leave no legacy for the future, and it will ruin lives now. To
allow the plagiarism  of works of not only individuals but creative corporations is stealing. Intellectual property is property, and using
copyrighted works without perm ission and appropriate com pensation is theft. AI holds no place in the future of a thriving nor even
functioning United States.
