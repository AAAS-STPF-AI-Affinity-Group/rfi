General Comment
Generative AI is nothing but a constant violation of the rights and labor of m illions of individuals, worldwide. It transfers copyright and skill
from  hum ans to a handful of tech corporations to directly com pete across fields.
It is a threat to hum an creativity and the m arketplace, and needs to be com pletely regulated to disallow this m ass theft.
