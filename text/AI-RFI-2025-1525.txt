General Comment
I am  an Artist working in Anim ation, we NEED copyright protections. What is the point of creating anything for anyone if som eone can
steal it and claim  it as their own, and in the case of Open AI, scrape all of our hard work without consent in order to power Generative AI
algorithm s whose function only serves to replace hum an artists and creative people. Not to m ention the am ount of energy required to fuel
these large language m odels. If it runs on stolen m aterials, it should not be allowed to run at all.
