Hi Faisal, 
I hope all is well. I recently saw an update regarding the White House invitation for public  
comment on AI, and I’d like to be considered.
About me: I’ve run a digital web agency for nearly 20 years. I’m a father, who uses AI on a  
daily basis in both my business and and personal life.
I’d like to address the issue of AI from the perspective of creating ways to empower US  
citizens to use AI the way that I do - in my business.
AtlasKicks.com is a good example of this. No, this isn’t a commercial. This a real project that  
I created with my son.
If the US is to be a powerhouse of AI - one of the best ways to do is to have its population  
actually use AI. 
In this instance, I’d like to provide my insights, voice, and experience in this realm to  
contribute to the better good of our country.
I’d love to chat further about this, if you’re available. 
Best, 
Aaron Plaat
