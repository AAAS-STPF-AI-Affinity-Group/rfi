General Comment
What is the point of copyright laws, m eant to protect the works of the people m aking the effort to m ake them , if a com pany is allowed to
ignore them  for personal profit? You are granting a unreasonable license for som ething with very little and narrow use case, that cannot be
undone, and leaves no recourse from  the effort that this com pany steals from . This is entirely unacceptable. Generative 'AI' functions only
on the stolen work of others which is why and how it exist today, but such theft should not be m ade legal and those harm ed by it should
have legal recourse not stolen from  them  as well.
