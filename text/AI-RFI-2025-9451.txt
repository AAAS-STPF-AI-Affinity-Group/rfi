General Comment
The restrictions put on AI com panies are not burdensom e, they are basic intellectual property law, and if individuals and other sectors are
expected to respect it, then so should AI com panies, regardless of their m odels. There is no necessity to carve out a special exem ption,
one that will be abused to unfairly increase their presence in m arkets and aspects wholly unrelated to security, and they have dem onstrated
in the past an inability to "silo" said data even if they prom ised to do so. This is no different than saying Tesla can steal technology patents
because "their cars are im portant to the governm ent". It is m isusing the governm ent to show favoritism  and tip the scales of the m arket,
which will draw costly and tim e-consum ing lawsuits by their com petitors, as well as everyone who has had their intellectual property used
without explicit consent.
