General Comment
You are m aking a huge m istake. This is really bad for the free m arket. A lot of people don’t want AI. Com panies who em brace AI are
losing a lot of m oney on it. Do not do this. If you really care about econom ic growth, then you have to shelve this plan im m ediately! AI is a
speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and huge legal problem s by enabling them .
Nvidia’s $600B m arket cap drop was not an accident, AI is a speculative bubble waiting to pop. We are talking about a potential m arket
collapse here and that’s going to hurt the shareholders a lot. Billions and billions of dollars just erased because som e com panies fought
chasing AI would work so well except the people don’t want that.
