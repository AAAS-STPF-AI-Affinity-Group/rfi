Public Comment on the Development of an
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
Introduction
I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the Office of Science and Technology Policy
(OSTP) and NITRD NCO's development of an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. This  
comment draws on publicly available perspectives from AI industry leaders, researchers, and  
policy experts to suggest priority policy actions that can both sustain American leadership in  
AI and ensure appropriate safeguards without unnecessarily hindering innovation.
Priority Policy Actions
1. Research and Development Funding
The United States should significantly increase federal funding for fundamental AI research  
across multiple agencies, with particular emphasis on:
Safety and alignment research to ensure AI systems remain beneficial, controllable, and
aligned with human values
Innovative approaches to AI that may yield breakthroughs beyond current largelanguage model paradigms
Computing infrastructure access for academic researchers and smaller companies toprevent research concentration solely among the largest companies
As Sam Altman of OpenAI has noted, "Government investment in AI safety research is one ofthe most important things we can do right now."
2. Establish Clear Regulatory Frameworks with Tiered Approaches
Develop a tiered regulatory approach based on AI system capabilities and risk profiles:
For frontier or highly capable AI systems: Implement mandatory safety evaluations, riskassessments, and reporting requirements
For medium-risk applications: Create industry standards and certification processes
For low-risk applications: Rely primarily on existing regulations and guidelines


Dario Amodei of Anthropic has emphasized the importance of "tailoring regulation to the
capabilities of the system rather than applying one-size-fits-all rules."
3. Public-Private Partnership for AI Safety and Standards
Formalize collaboration between government, industry, and academia through:
A national AI safety institute that coordinates research and establishes best practices
Industry consortia to develop technical standards for AI evaluation and safety
Shared testing infrastructure for pre-deployment assessment of potentially harmful
capabilities
4. Talent Development and Immigration Reform
To maintain American leadership in AI:
Expand AI-related education and training programs across all education levels
Reform immigration policies to attract and retain global AI talent, including expandingvisa programs for AI researchers and engineers
Create pathways for international AI experts to work in the United States with feweradministrative barriers
Fei-Fei Li of Stanford University has stated that "talent is the most crucial resource in AIdevelopment, and the US must remain a magnet for global AI talent."
5. Computing Infrastructure and Energy
Prioritize initiatives to:
Increase domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability specifically for AIapplications
Invest in energy infrastructure to support the growing power demands of AI computing
Accelerate research into energy-efficient AI training and inference methods
6. International Cooperation and Standards
Develop a coordinated international approach by:
Leading international standard-setting efforts for AI safety and governance
Establishing bilateral and multilateral agreements with allied nations on AI developmentprinciples
Creating mechanisms for international coordination on managing advanced AI systems
Balancing Innovation and Responsibility
The AI Action Plan should carefully balance promoting innovation while addressinglegitimate safety concerns:
1.Avoid Premature or Overly Prescriptive Regulation : Technical specifications should


remain flexible enough to accommodate rapid technological change.
2.Focus on Outcomes Rather Than Methods: Regulate based on system capabilities and
impacts rather than specific technical approaches.
3.Promote Competition: Ensure that regulatory frameworks don't entrench incumbentadvantages or create barriers to entry for smaller innovators.
4.Strengthen Existing Regulatory Bodies: Equip agencies like the FTC, FDA, and NISTwith AI expertise and resources rather than creating entirely new regulatory structures.
Conclusion
The United States has an opportunity to set global standards for responsible AI developmentwhile maintaining its technological leadership. By implementing these priority actions, the AIAction Plan can create a framework that promotes innovation while addressing legitimatesafety concerns and ensuring that AI development benefits society broadly.
