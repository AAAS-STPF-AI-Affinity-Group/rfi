Dear Sir or Madam ,
Copyright is a system  that was designed to protect the rights of people and to encourage innovation of people. Neither a com puter nor a
program  nor an algorithm  is a person. AI can not create. It can not innovate. It can not transform . It can only derive. It plagiarizes to
create a product. Just because it plagiarizes thousands of tim es to m ake a product does not negate the fact that it plagiarizes. 
The people who created the works AI derives from  are entitled to control their work fundam entally. A com puter can not create. There is
no room  for discussion.
Thank you for your tim e.
