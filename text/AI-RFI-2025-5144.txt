General Comment
Ai is a waste of energy and funds. For as long as hum ans existed we didn't need an extrem ely flawed com puter to m ake our choices and
entertain us. Ai didn't create fire we did. Ai has no soul in their creations and steal from  real artist to create a hom unculus of garbage just
so com panies can save m oney on som ething that doesn't work or look horrible. Pass this and you have killed the future Picasso before
they were even born.
