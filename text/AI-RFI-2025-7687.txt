General Comment
I am  a writer, an artist, a m usician, a person existing on the internet, and I do not consent to having m y words, m y art, m y m usic -- m y
work, the fruits of m y labor, the product of m y thought ad consideration and toil -- used as fodder for large-language m odels (erroneously
called "artificial intelligence") intended to render m e obsolete.
Enough is enough. It's tim e to stop perm itting technologies of no actual utility to have a free ride on the backs of working creative people.
The creators of OpenAI have said openly that if they are forced to com pensate creative people fairly, their com pany cannot survive. 
Then let it die.
Sam  Altm an has said -- publicly, in front of God and everybody, with no apparent fear of being pelted with wet garbage wheresoever he
goes -- that where the developm ent of AI conflicts with the social contract, it is the social contract that will need to give way. 
I do not say this lightly: this is the attitude of a sociopath. It am ounts to an adm ission of crim inal intent. Uphold the social contract. Serve
the people of this country. Do your jobs and kill this dam nfool idea.
