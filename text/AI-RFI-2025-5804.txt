General Comment
It's a sad day to hear that our represe ntatives would even entertain the idea of making AI immune to cop yright laws. I am ASHAMED to 
be a c itizen of t his country anymore. I used to have a se mblance of pr ide, but it was murdered by t hese k inds of laws that horrible peop le 
try to pass.
DO BETTE R! Seriousl y, f&^% you guys for even entertai ning this idea. I hope the dev il has kept your seats warm for when you 
kick the  bucket
