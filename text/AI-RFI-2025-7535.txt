General Comment
Copyright law protects the work and livelihood of people across all creative fields. AI com panies should not be allowed to exploit that
work without paying for it, just to create a product they can sell to subscribers. They understand the value of the context theyâ€™re trying to
access, and creators should not have their work stolen from  them .
