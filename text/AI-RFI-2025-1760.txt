General Comment
OpenAI trains on stolen neural and bio data and that’s the real reason they want to chip away at copyright. Not only do they steal from
what’s online, but from  targeting others in the physical world. Rights for m achines is about genetic AI. If they want to steal from  everyone
it should be a public product and Sam  Altm an should receive zero profit.
