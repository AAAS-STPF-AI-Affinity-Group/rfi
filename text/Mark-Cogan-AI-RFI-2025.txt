This document seeks to give OpenAI access to information without following existing
copyright laws.   To allow ANY private company unfettered access to personal information,
without oversight or legal protection, would be a grave risk to every individual.   What would
stop OpenAI from accessing PII, HIPAA protected data, or bank accounts?   What would hold
them accountable if they copy published works and then try to sue claiming they were theoriginator?
  The law must apply equally to ALL individuals, including technologies.   Please
do not go forward with this.
