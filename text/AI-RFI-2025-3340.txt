General Comment
AI m odels should not be trained on copyrighted m aterial or m aterial not explicitly offered for training. There is no societal benefit to AI
stealing creative output. Generative AI in its current form  is not a great benefit to our society. It uses intensive resources to produce
m ediocre results and as its use increases we will see less quality work from  real people. The m odels will eventually be consum ing and
producing garbage.
