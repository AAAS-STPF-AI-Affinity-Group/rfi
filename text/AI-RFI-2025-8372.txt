General Comment
If there is no transparency in how AI is trained and used, then not only will AI developm ent fail, but it will also be a failure to the Am erican
people. Copyright laws exist for a reason—to protect originality, creativity, and the rights of creators. While I understand that AI needs a
foundation to learn from , it should still be held to the sam e copyright standards that apply to hum an creators. Without such accountability,
the value of intellectual property could be dim inished, m aking original work feel null and void.
A m ajor concern is that AI, if not properly regulated, m ay contribute to the erosion of originality. As AI system s generate content based
on vast datasets, there is a risk that they will not only replicate but also inadvertently exploit copyrighted m aterial. According to Buick
(2024), ensuring transparency in AI training data is crucial for upholding copyright protections and m aintaining trust in creative industries.
If creators’ rights are not safeguarded, the incentive to innovate m ay decline, im pacting fields such as poetry, m usic, and literature—areas
where originality thrives.
While it is true that people som etim es feel discouraged upon realizing their ideas are not unique, this realization often pushes them  to refine
their creativity and find new approaches. Inspiration fuels artistic and intellectual progress, and without clear boundaries for AI use, this
cycle of innovation could be disrupted. Buick (2024) em phasizes that transparency in AI training is essential to m itigating legal and ethical
challenges, ensuring that AI does not underm ine hum an creativity but rather supports it.
Transparency in AI developm ent and usage is critical. Without it, we risk devaluing creative work and allowing AI to operate outside of
the legal and ethical standards that hum an creators m ust follow. Copyright protections m ust extend into the digital age, ensuring that both
AI and hum an creators are held to the sam e standards.
