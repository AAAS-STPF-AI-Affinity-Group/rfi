General Comment
If the governm ent lets big tech com panies train on content they do not own, they will be m aking a terrible m istake. They will be doom ing
all hum an artists- existing and aspiring- to not pursue their passions. Even if they still do, they will be buried under piles of AI content that's
just looking at other people's content and trying to replicate it. Now, I am  an artist, so I am  very concerned about that, but I have m ore
concerns beyond what effects m e on a personal and professional level. I also am  highly concerned about the other results from  this. The
fact that AI will be trying to generate its own content rather than just give you the exact thing that you have asked for m eans that in
scientific circles, inform ation will be harder to find, and there will be a higher likelihood of finding m isinform ation m ade by a m achine.
Additionally, this sets a precedent of not respecting copyright laws. That m akes it so even patents will have precedent for being stolen. Do
not let anyone take our work. The work of everyone across the world will not be secure. It will lead to m ass intellectual property theft. I
cannot fathom  believing this will be a net positive for anyone- from  som eone without a hom e, to the CEO of the biggest corporation in the
world.
