General Comment
This plan will allow corporations to utilize Am erican m ade artwork to train AI networks with little to no respect for the proud Am erican
artists. Other nations will be able to use content generated by said AI networks, thus rem oving the United States from  the center of world
art and culture and handing it to borderless corporations. In this tim e law and order m ust be upheld and rem oving such laws protecting
working Am ericans freedom  of expression would be a stain upon our culture.
