General Comment
AI to this unrestricted degree is NOT where our country and technology should be heading. It does not hold a place in the future of the
US. This is not the great leap into a brighter tom orrow the sponsors behind this act want to m ake it out to be. What this is, is the
replacem ent and theft of real hum an-m ade work just to line the pockets of big corporations. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican
and profits off of this theft.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. Do not let ourselves be fooled
