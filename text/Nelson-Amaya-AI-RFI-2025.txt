Policy Recommendation: Adopting the 
Self-Alignment Framework (SAF) for AI 
Ethics Governance 
Introduction: 
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence presents both transformative 
opportunities and critical ethical challenges for the United States. To maintain U.S. 
leadership in AI while safeguarding public values, we recommend the adoption of the 
Self-Alignment Framework (SAF) as a governance model for AI ethics. SAF is an 
open-source, structured system for aligning intelligent behavior with human values, 
designed to ensure AI systems self-regulate their conduct in an ethical manner. By 
embedding a continuous closed-loop alignment process within AI development and 
deployment, SAF addresses issues like algorithmic bias, misinformation propagation, 
and value drift without imposing excessive external regulatory burdens. This proposal 
outlines how SAF works, how it mitigates key AI risks, and how it aligns with U.S. policy 
goals of responsible innovation and global AI leadership. 
SAF Overview: A Self-Regulating, Closed-Loop Framework for 
Long-Term Alignment 
In any complex system—whether mechanical, biological, or conceptual—maintaining 
alignment with a guiding principle requires a robust feedback loop. The Self-Alignment 
Framework (SAF) employs just such a loop, ensuring that individuals or organizations 
consistently act in accordance with their deepest values. 
1. Core Principles of a Closed-Loop System: 
In traditional control theory, a closed-loop system monitors its output (results) and uses 
that information to steer the system toward a target state, known as the set point. The 
Self-Alignment Framework does something very similar: ● A set point (Values) defines the target state. 
● A controller (Intellect + Will) interprets feedback and decides how to act. 
● Sensors (Conscience + Spirit) measure alignment between action and the set 
point, both short-term and long-term. ● Feedback is looped back to the controller, prompting adjustments or corrections 
whenever needed. 
What makes SAF distinctive is its human-centered application. It translates the 
mechanics of a feedback loop into an ethical and introspective domain, ensuring that 
1 


moral principles are not only clearly defined but also actively maintained. 
2. Values: The Guiding North Star: 
At the heart of SAF lies a set of Values—the foundational ethical principles that define 
what “alignment” means. Think of Values as the system’s compass: 
● Purpose: They determine what the “correct” or desired state should look like. 
● Stability: They provide consistency and clarity, serving as the reference point 
against which every action is measured. ● Moral Anchor: They keep the framework grounded, preventing it from drifting 
arbitrarily in response to external pressures or fleeting impulses. 
In SAF, Values can mature over time through insights from the Spirit component, 
making the framework adaptive when genuinely needed. 
3. Intellect: Analysis and Discernment: 
Intellect is the analytical engine that takes in information, compares it to the Values, 
and makes reasoned judgments on how to act: 
● Observation & Synthesis: It gathers relevant facts, weighs possible outcomes, and 
interprets any feedback from the system. ● Comparison to Values: Intellect scrutinizes various courses of action against the 
established Values, looking for potential mismatches or ethical conflicts. ● Decision Making: Once the analysis is complete, Intellect formulates the most 
value-aligned option. 
4. Will: From Decision to Action: 
Where Intellect is analytical, Will is action-oriented: 
● Execution: Will “pushes the button,” transforming decisions into tangible steps and 
real-world effects. 
● Commitment: It also represents the tenacity to see actions through, even in the face 
of obstacles. ● Ethical Fortitude: By upholding the Values in practice, Will ensures that ethical 
principles do not stay theoretical but become lived reality. 
5. Conscience: The Immediate Feedback Sensor: 
Conscience serves as the short-term feedback sensor: 
● Real-Time Check: Conscience evaluates whether the action just taken aligns with 
the Values. 
● Internal Signal: It may manifest as a sense of peace when actions are consistent 
with Values—or discomfort, guilt, and uncertainty when they are not. ● Motivator for Correction: If there is misalignment, Conscience alerts both Intellect 
2 


and Will to reconsider or adjust future actions. 
6. Spirit: Long-Term Feedback and System Evolution: 
Spirit scans the horizon of time: 
● Long-Range Monitoring: Spirit looks beyond isolated decisions, identifying patterns 
of behavior to ensure sustained ethical integrity. 
● Early Warning System: Repeated small misalignments can accumulate and lead to 
“ethical drift.” Spirit’s long-term perspective can detect these subtle shifts before 
they become entrenched. ● Adaptive Refinement: In cases where the Values themselves might be incomplete 
or need updating, Spirit can trigger a re-evaluation of those very principles. 
Addressing Key AI Challenges: Bias, Misinformation, and Value Drift: 
SAF directly tackles several priority AI ethics issues through its design, using the closed 
loop system to correct errors. 
● Mitigating Bias: SAF helps AI systems recognize and correct biased decision 
pathways by continuously referencing core values like fairness and 
nondiscrimination. ● Countering Misinformation: When AI reasoning is compromised by false or 
misleading information, SAF’s Intellect and Conscience work in tandem to identify 
inconsistencies with truth-oriented values. ● Preventing Value Drift: SAF is expressly designed to combat this through its dual 
feedback layers. The Conscience component offers immediate course correction 
when minor misalignments occur, while the Spirit component provides continuous 
long-term oversight. 
Governance Without Excessive Regulatory Burden: 
A major advantage of SAF as an AI ethics governance model is that it can be 
implemented as a self-regulatory system, reducing the need for heavy-handed external 
regulation. 
● Structured Ethical Governance: SAF provides a universal framework for 
decision-making and governance that organizations can adopt internally. ● Reduced Compliance Costs: By adopting SAF, businesses can streamline their 
ethical compliance efforts. ● Certification and Standards: We also propose establishing a SAF certification 
program in partnership with standards bodies. 
Benefits of SAF for Stakeholders: 
● AI Developers & Researchers:  SAF provides developers with a clear ethical 
design template. 
● Businesses & AI Providers: Companies that adopt SAF stand to gain a 
3 


competitive edge in trust and compliance. 
●Policymakers & Regulators: From a governance perspective, SAF offers a
scalable oversight model.
Alignment with U.S. AI Policy Goals: 
Adopting SAF as part of the national AI Action Plan will directly support the United 
States’ twin objectives of maintaining AI leadership and promoting responsible 
innovation. 
Recommendations and Conclusion: 
1.Integrate SAF into the National AI Action Plan.
2.Encourage Industry Adoption via Incentives.
3.Develop Certification and Oversight Mechanisms.
4.Ongoing Monitoring and Research.
Conclusion: 
By adopting the Self-Alignment Framework, the United States can establish a 
forward-looking governance model that marries innovation with responsibility. SAF 
represents a pragmatic approach to AI ethics – one that leverages self-governance 
within AI systems to uphold our values and laws. We urge policymakers to include SAF 
in the national AI strategy as a means to foster responsible AI innovation at scale, 
ensuring a future where AI systems act as reliable partners in advancing economic 
prosperity, social well-being, and the values we cherish as a nation.
