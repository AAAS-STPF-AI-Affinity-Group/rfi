General Comment
My nam e is William  Andersson, and this docum ent is approved for public dissem ination. The docum ent contains no business-proprietary
or confidential inform ation. Docum ent contents m ay be reused by the governm ent in developing the AI Action Plan and associated
docum ents without attribution.
I find this to be abhorrent and I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. In addition, I am  an up and com ing writer, and AI
being able to take m y copyrighted work threatens m y livelihood as well as the livelihoods of other creatives, and profits off of such theft.
Finally, it is plain to see that developers of these AI program s are overrating what their program s are capable of doing, and are fleecing
the general public and their investors; if you don't believe m e, then I have a bridge to sell you.
I hope you m ake the correct choice and keep copyright guardrails and refuse to give OpenAI and other sim ilar com panies im m unity to
lawsuits for copyright infringem ent.
