General Comment
To dem and the US’s dom inance in AI is a joke of a statem ent when AI has not been proven to m eaningfully im prove people’s day to day
lives in the first place. To rem ove what little guard rails we have on an unproven tool that we know steals inform ation, is a m assive energy
and resource sink, and WILL be used to lay off and undervalue Am erican workers is the exact reason why we shouldn’t. AI is
exploitative of labor and the corporations looking to use it are m aking no efforts to use it in ways that could im prove their workers
conditions. An already poorly treated, undervalued, and overworked workforce. Any econom ic gains m ade with AI com e at the expense
of exploited artists and workers who have not consented to their works being used to train m odels. Any corporation that m oved forward
with AI risks lawsuits not if, but WHEN collective groups sue for the unlawful scraping of their works. If they wanted their m aterials m ade
for free public use, they would have specified. As it stands AI is already rife with risky and speculative over-valuation and should be
approached with caution. Do not rem ove what little guard rails there are.
