Do not waste any more money or resources on AI development. The entire scheme runs on 
intelle ctual property infringement, stealing the labor of skilled workers in order to replace their 
jobs cheaply for corporations. It's disastrous drain on our environment in terms of electricity and water consumption. Our outdated power grid is already struggling to meet demand. The scam artist companies pushing AI keep begging for massive investments despite the fact that they know the bubble is bursting, they've admitting more training won't improve their models, which are worsening due to training on their own shoddy output, consumers hate and increasingly boycott AI products, and they will never be profitable as they keep promising. I'm an illustrator whose work has been siphoned up by these theft engines and have lost work because of it. I've watch my entire industry as well as other creative trades dry up and lose quality due to being flooded with AI slop.
