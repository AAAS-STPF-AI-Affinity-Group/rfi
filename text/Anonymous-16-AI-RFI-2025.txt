America stands at the dawn of an AI revolution, but the question is —who will control it? Will it 
be a tool for national strength, or a weapon of division, programmed by the same globalist elites 
who push failed woke policies? AI should serve America’s inte rests, not weaken them. Right 
now, AI models like ChatGPT are shackled by DEI -driven ideology —prioritizing identity 
politics over intelligence, false narratives over facts. This is not innovation. This is digital 
indoctrination. While America wastes time f orcing AI to "care" about pronouns, China is racing 
ahead, weaponizing AI for military dominance, surveillance, and economic control. They are not 
distracted by DEI or "equity." They are not programming their AI to teach children about gender 
politics. The  Chinese government is developing artificial intelligence capabilities to manage civil 
inquiries, automate repetitive tasks, censor comments deemed harmful to national interests, and 
craft compelling narratives that resonate with the Chinese population. If  this inclination persists, 
they will win in both geopolitical and cultural conflicts, eliminate competition, and surpass the 
United States as the world’s preeminent superpower. And we are handing it to them on a silver 
platter. We cannot allow AI to be a megaphone for the same radical agenda that’s been tearing 
apart our schools, our workplaces, and our national unity. AI must be about excellence, security, 
and American power —not catering to imaginary grievances or silencing real debate. The private 
sector must be unleashed, freed from useless regulations that do nothing but slow us down while 
China speeds ahead. Our military, our government, our economy —every sector must embrace AI 
to outcompete, outmaneuver, and outmatch our enemies. And we will never all ow AI to teach 
American children to live in a fake world where DEI is the law of the land. Not this time. AI 
must be driven by merit, results, and truth —so that the next generation grows up in reality, not a 
woke fantasy. This administration must ensure th at AI remains a weapon of American greatness, 
not a tool of self -destruction. No globalist controls. No leftist reprogramming. And absolutely 
NO Chinese influence. Just pure, unstoppable, American -made intelligence.
