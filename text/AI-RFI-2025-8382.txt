General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of the theft of
intellectual property. AI uses far too m uch energy and creates too m uch carbon dioxide to justify its use. It drives up the cost of energy for
other consum ers.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the Am erican public.
