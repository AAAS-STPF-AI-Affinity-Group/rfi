Subject: AI Policy Recommendations for U.S. Leadership in Competition with China 
Date: March 15, 2025  
The current framing of the ‘AI race’ between the United States and China misses the point. Just 
like the electricity race a century ago, it won’t necessarily be the first nation to develop 
advanced technologies that will gain the advantage. Instead, the real ‘winner’ will be the nation 
who integrates this technology fastest and most effectively into industries critical to economic 
and strategic dominance. The U.S. is overly reliant on a defensive approach, centered on 
restricting China’s access to advanced chips, which neglects the vulnerabilities in our own AI 
supply chains and underestimates the effectiveness of mid-tier chips. 
This memo offers specific and actionable recommendations to shift from a reactive stance to a 
proactive strategy. 
Recommendations: 
1: Increase economic security of AI supply chains 
2: Prioritize AI adoption within industry 
3: Expand export controls 
4.Protect sensitive datasets and promote secure data sharing
1.Increase economic security of AI supply chains
The U.S. is heavily reliant on China for the basic mechanical parts needed to run AI 
infrastructure. These are components like server racks, cooling units, connectors, and power 
supplies, which are all necessary to make AI chips function. These components are inexpensive 
with very low margins, which has allowed China to dominate production through decades of 
targeted industrial policy. If China imposes retaliatory export controls on these essential parts, it 
could slow down our ability to expand AI quickly and maintain our lead.  
First, the U.S. should offer clear incentives to companies who bring the manufacturing of these 
components back home. A secondary approach would be to promote manufacturing of these 
components within allied partner countries in the Asia-Pacific, such as Japan, South Korea, and 
Australia. Targeted tax incentives would encourage U.S. and allied businesses to produce these 
components domestically, creating a stronger and more secure supply chain while reinvigorating 
the U.S.’s manufacturing sector. 
Second, the U.S. should start building stockpiles of these mechanical components, which would 
ensure that future domestic AI infrastructure isn’t vulnerable to sudden supply chain shocks. 
Having a reliable reserve of these parts would provide additional safeguards against potential 
disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions, retaliatory export restrictions, or unexpected market 
shortages. These stockpiles should be built gradually and sourced from multiple suppliers to 


avoid drawing unwanted attention to this strategy from China.  
Finally, setting regular meetings with public and private sector industry leaders within the chip 
and manufacturing space would allow for quicker responses to potential disruptions. Better 
communication and collaboration will allow us to spot risks sooner and address them before 
they slow us down. 
2.Prioritize AI adoption within industry
Winning the AI race isn’t about who develops the most advanced models first. It’s about who 
adopts AI into their economy first and does it strategically. China understands this and is already 
embedding AI into manufacturing, logistics, and finance. The U.S. needs to move quickly to 
ensure AI adoption happens in the industries that directly impact economic power and national 
security. 
First, AI should be deployed within manufacturing to increase efficiency and output. AI-driven 
predictive maintenance and automated quality control will reduce costs and strengthen 
production domestically. To accelerate this adoption, targeted tax incentives should be offered to 
manufacturers that integrate AI into their operations, allowing the U.S. to become competitive in 
manufacturing again. Second, AI should be embedded into logistics operations to lower costs and contribute 
additional security to existing supply chains. This strategy could include AI-driven route 
optimization and warehouse automation. Incentivizing AI adoption in transportation and 
distribution operations will ensure the U.S. maintains more control over supply networks and 
positions itself ahead of global competitors. Third, AI should be integrated into fintech to strengthen U.S. leadership within financial markets. 
AI-driven fraud detection and automated risk assessment tools will also improve efficiency and 
security within financial markets. Expanding regulatory sandboxes to allow fintech firms to test 
and deploy AI solutions faster will further position the U.S. as the leader of global financial 
innovation. Fourth, AI should be used within energy and resource management. AI can significantly improve 
grid efficiency, predict equipment failures, and optimize energy distribution paths. These 
applications will reduce costs and increase reliability. Supporting AI adoption in energy 
infrastructure would also enhance national security by allowing power grids to become more 
resilient to real-time cyber threats and unexpected supply disruptions since AI’s predictive 
capabilities allow grids to anticipate and respond to risks before they escalate. 
3.Expand export controls
Current U.S. export controls focus on cutting off China’s access to top-tier AI chips, but this 
strategy has shortcomings. Chinese companies, like DeepSeek, have shown that meaningful 
advancements in AI do not require creating large AI models from scratch, which is where these 
top-tier chips are needed most. Instead, mid-tier chips can be used to train specialized models 
from existing foundational models like Chat GPT or Claude. These specialized models can be 


fine-tuned for specific tasks using far less computing power, allowing China to make rapid AI 
advancements without relying on top-tier chips.  
First, the U.S. should establish a clear performance threshold for mid-tier chips and extend 
export controls accordingly. This would prevent chips capable of supporting large-scale 
specialized model training from flowing freely into China. 
Second, the U.S. semiconductor firms should develop export-friendly versions of mid-tier chips, 
just as they’ve done with the restricted high-tier chips. Companies like NVIDIA have already 
developed modified chips with slight performance limits to comply with export restrictions while 
still meeting global demand. A similar approach for mid-tier chips would slow China’s ability to 
scale specialized AI models without significantly disrupting supply chains within global markets. 
Finally, these new export controls need to be aligned with U.S. allies such as Japan, South 
Korea, Taiwan, and the EU. Coordinated policies across major semiconductor-producing nations 
would close loopholes and prevent China from sourcing restricted chips elsewhere.  
4.Protect sensitive datasets and promote secure data sharing
Overly broad data restrictions can slow down U.S. AI innovation and adoption, but leaving data 
open comes with security risks and allows competitors like China to secure an advantage. A 
balance must be struck between these two extremes. The U.S. needs a more calculated 
approach that protects truly sensitive datasets while allowing American AI firms to have the data 
they need to advance AI models and remain competitive. 
First, the government should clearly define what qualifies as highly sensitive data and enforce 
strict protections for it. This may include biometric records, genomic data, and classified 
intelligence. These datasets could create significant national security risks if adversaries were 
able to access and train specialized models from them. 
Second, the U.S. should encourage secure data-sharing partnerships between public and 
private sectors. Companies and research institutions both need large and accurate datasets to 
develop AI effectively, but access must be structured to prevent misuse. Establishing 
frameworks for sharing anonymized and non-sensitive data would allow for more domestic AI 
advancements. 
Considerations  
The adoption of AI is necessary to maintain U.S. leadership, but there are many considerations 
that must be accounted for in the implementation of these policies. AI integration comes with 
economic, ethical, and national security implications that should be weighted to ensure 
long-term prosperity for the nation.  
1.Job displacement and workforce readiness


Expanding AI in industry will increase productivity but could also lead to significant job 
displacement. Policymakers should consider strategies to retrain American workers to ensure 
that AI-driven economic growth benefits the U.S. workforce rather than replace it. Incentives to 
adopt AI practices should be paired with workforce training programs to prepare workers for 
higher-skilled roles in AI-integrated industries. 
2.Ethical implications
AI adoption has clear economic and strategic benefits, but it also raises concerns about misuse, 
especially within financial markets. AI-driven trading, lending, and fraud detection tools can 
improve efficiency, but if not properly managed, they could introduce systemic risks or be 
exploited in ways that significantly destabilize markets. The administration should consider 
targeted safeguards that reduce these risks without stifling AI development. Rather than imposing heavy-handed regulations that slow down innovation, the focus should be 
on practical oversight that prevents reckless deployment. This could include ensuring AI-driven 
financial systems are transparent enough to detect manipulation and fraud. Significant 
consideration should be given to balancing the protection of U.S. financial markets while making 
sure AI progress isn’t slowed unnecessarily.
