General Comment
Large-data AI m odels are presently incom petent for the roles they are advertised to fill. Industry leaders prom ise that they will be, soon,
and that they need just a bit m ore data to achieve this. They said this last generation, and the generation before, and the generation before;
and each tim e they get what they ask, their m odels arrived late, overbudget, and only slightly-less-incom petent. Now, they seek sweeping
changes to our national laws which presently push our population to pursue excellence by securing for us the fruits of our success. Now,
they seek excuses to snatch these fruits for and then with their incom petence engines. Worse, the only ways they can sell their services is
as and for junior knowledge workers, who need em ploym ent experience to grow into senior knowledge workers. On its current
trajectory, large-data AI m odels are not, will not soon, and m ay never be rem otely capable of serving as senior knowledge workers, but
these incom petence engines will still cut off our supply of real senior knowledge workers. 
For decades, we as a nation have trained the best knowledge workers the world has ever seen, and then we have cast them  out of our
country. Now, large-data AI m odels will cede even that to both our long-standing foes and what friends we now antagonize. If we wish to
twist our laws--our fundam ental principles!--to the purpose of feeding these large, expensive, unprofitable toys, we can only expect to find
ourselves becom e spoiled children on the world stage.
