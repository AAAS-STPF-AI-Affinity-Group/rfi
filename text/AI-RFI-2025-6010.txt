General Comment
I don't think generative AI deserves to be given special treatm ent in the law. There is a lot of m isinform ation about generative AI, and it
arguably needs m ore restrictions, not less. Training data needs to be properly licensed and com panies should be required to be m ore
transparent about what data they trained on.
