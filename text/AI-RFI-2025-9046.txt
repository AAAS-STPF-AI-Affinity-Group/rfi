General Comment
Intellectual property and copyright protection MUST be at the very core of any AI policy m oving forward, these com panies should not be
allowed to take and rem ix copyrighted works of art, be they film , photography, m usic, illustration, etc without expressly granted
perm ission from  rights holders. 
Personal data protection is also a m assive concern. How m any children's faces have been added to these databases without their
guardian's perm ission? How m any m edical records have been scraped? 
Any com pany using a database of m edia to train their AI m ust be required by law to m ake their training sets publicly accessible and
auditable. They m ust be easily com pelled to rem ove copyrighted work by rights holders, or personal inform ation and photos of individuals
who wish to rem ain om itted.
In addition to laws that com pel AI com panies to be transparent and open, but we also need new protections for individual data privacy.
