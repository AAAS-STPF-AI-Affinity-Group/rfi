General Comment
To whom  it m ay concern,
Generative AI is an existential and econom ic threat to m any different industries and will utterly devastate hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Allowing OpenAI and other AI com panies to scrape copyrighted work will NOT "prom ote hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness,
and national security" as this Presidential Executive Order suggests, but will m erely underm ine Am erica's cultural dom inance on a global
scale and set back decades of creative output. As proven by China's DeepSeek from  late-2024, an AI m odel DOES NOT NEED
endless data to advance it; OpenAI wants copyrighted data because it is built on a zero-sum  business and technical plan. If this order
were to go through and copyrighted works are fed into OpenAI's proverbial wood chipper, what's left? 
I would like to rem ind those who are reading m y com m ent that OpenAI is financially unsustainable and expected to lose $44 billion until it
is projected to be profitable in 2029, based on its own shaky data. Trusting them  with Am erica's greatest cultural outputs will be wasted
on them , but m ake no m istake, it would be wasted on ALL AI com panies.
