Coordination Office, National Science Foundation,
 
While other guardrails may be necessary, I suggest that AI safety concerns can be efficientlyaddressed by clarifying that AI is a tool used by humans who remain responsible for the resultsof its use. 
 It should be the responsibility of AI developers to accurately inform users about the
characteristics of the tools they have developed.   So informed, users should take responsibility
for what results from their application of the tools.   The same should apply whether the users
are individual humans, or groups of humans acting as businesses or government entities.   In
the case of the military, responsibility for the results of AI use should go up the chain ofcommand, just as does responsibility for the use of other tools.
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
