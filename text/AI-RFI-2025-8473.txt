General Comment
AI steals from  the livelihoods of working Am ericans and profits off of theft. People who call regulations "burdensom e" are trying to avoid
consequences for harm ing others. AI is not what its m arketers say it is and it has yet to offer a solution to any real problem  that doesn't
have better solutions available already. It is expensive and wasteful and not worth investing in to begin with. It should not even be called
AI, as it is not an artificial intelligence. It is a com puter program  that m akes probability guesses and gets those wrong m ost of the tim e. I
oppose the rem oval of safeguards around AI developm ent. There need to be m ore safeguards put into place around m achine learning and
predictive m odels.
