I like the approach of light touch regulations. Given that China is right behind us with AI, I donâ€™t 
think we should overregulate. We should also work to subsidize our nascent chip industry since 
China is also very close behind with chips. Energy is anothe r area that requires deregulation and 
investment. All 3 combined should lead to a great AI future controlled by America.
