Hello,
I'm writing in response to the Request for Information on the Development of an AI Action
Plan.  
AI has a lot of potential to enhance our lives. It also has potential to be used with maliciousintent. It is imperative that the federal government regulates AI to ensure ethical andtransparent development of AI systems, including transparency around training data sets andhow information uploaded into AI systems will or will not become a part of the training data.
 
Sincerely,Sonia Chawla
