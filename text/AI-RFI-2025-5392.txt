General Comment
As an independent creative seeking to m ake a living off of their art and other work in the future, I urge that these actions are not carried
out, as their im plem entation as it stands would underm ine all types of creators and devalue their work by allowing anyone, especially those
with vast am ounts of capital, to exploit existing copyrighted works for their own gain, essentially stealing from  creators both large and
sm all. The econom ic fallout from  such a m aneuver would be disasterous in lawsuits alone. I again plead that these actions do not com e to
pass, as it would hurt every person who has ever m ade or will m ake any piece of art across any m edium . The world's artists are working
under already precarious conditions to m ake life m ore bearable for everyone, often barely scraping by as is. I would not see them  caused
further harm . I hope that these words do not fall upon deaf ears.
