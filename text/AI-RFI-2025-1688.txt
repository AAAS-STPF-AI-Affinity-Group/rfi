General Comment
As a graphic designer and illustrator by trade, I've watched with dism ay as A.I. has crept into m y field, sullied its integrity, and led to
fewer jobs. And all in service to an unreliable set of algorithm s that rarely do what their developers prom ise, all while accelerating clim ate
change and using disproportionate am ounts of electricity, draining our cities of water and power. If you want to prom ote hum ans, then
prom ote hum ans, but giving in to the scam  that is generative a.i. on a federal level is not the way to fo it. It's frankly em barrassing.
