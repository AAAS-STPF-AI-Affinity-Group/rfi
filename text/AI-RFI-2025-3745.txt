General Comment
The highest priorities in any plan of action involving AI m ust include the protections for the rights of the public, not lim ited to copyright and
reproduction. No other industry is allowed wholesale use of public creations without their owners' consent and/or com pensation, and AI
developm ent m ust not be any different in this regard. Several industries have already raised significant legal challenges to the creation and
use of AI m odels trained on copyrighted data, and such avenues m ust rem ain available in any plan developm ent. 
In addition, the plan m ust include requirem ents of efficiency and energy consum ption. LLMs and other AI system s have an exceptionally
high energy usage in both training and everyday use. If left unchecked, this will serve to strain our energy resources as m odels and their
usage grow. The trade war that the adm inistration has instigated against our closest trading partners has already had negative effects for
our energy supply - allowing these system s to add m ore for little gain would be pointless and wasteful in a tim e where we cannot afford
either.
