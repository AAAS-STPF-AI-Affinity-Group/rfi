General Comment
I like the approach of light touch regulations. Given that China is right behind us with AI, I donâ€™t think we should overregulate. We should
also work to subsidize our nascent chip industry since China is also very close behind with chips. Energy is another area that requires
deregulation and investm ent. All 3 com bined should lead to a great AI future controlled by Am erica.
