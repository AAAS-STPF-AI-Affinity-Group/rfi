General Comment
This country is sim ply not ready for AI. This technology is still developing, and from  what I've seen is has only been capable of creating
drastically inferior products to what already exists. Even at its full potential, it would likely be used for crim inal purposes without proper
restraints.
Unless we can assure that it doesn't violate the livelihoods of workers and consum ers alike, it is not a good idea to prioritize AI innovation
at this tim e. Thank You.
