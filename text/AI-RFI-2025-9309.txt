General Comment
As an Am erican who interacts with technology on a daily basis -- like m ost people today -- I am  honestly unsure why we need to be a
"leader" in this current iteration of so-called "A.I." Consum er-facing A.I. is an annoying hinderance at best, putting itself between software
users and the functions they actually want to use, and actively dam aging at worst, as with ChatGPT and Google's "A.I." search results
grossly m isinform ing their users with frustrating and dangerous frequency. All of these "A.I" m odels are built on the back of stolen goods,
and what would be best is policy to protect the writers, artists, photographers, coders, and other creative individuals AND corporations
that hold the rights to this work from  exploitation by these large technology firm s -- not loosening up copyright or m aking it im possible to
sue these com panies for their exploitation, but setting up an efficient system  so that these com panies can properly LICENSE works to
build out their m odels. Building policy that errs on the side of supporting these tech firm s at the expense of so m any other sectors of the
econom y doesn't m ake any sense; "A.I." is a m assive m oney-loser, while the creative arts m ake billions of dollars for Am erican
corporations both dom estically and abroad. Giving this inefficient financial sinkhole of tech preferential treatm ent just doesn't m ake any
financial sense.
Thank you for the opportunity to voice m y thoughts on this im portant m atter.
