General Comment
I have returned to working as a perform ing artist, and m y work and portfolio is building across screen, stage, and behind a m icrophone for
voice acting.
To have m y work used to train m odels without m y consent is a direct and unacceptable harm  upon m y livelihood and the livelihoods of m y
peers. Especially as a returning worker to the field of sim ple and m odest living, where the vast m ajority of working perform ers m aintain
their lives.
The uses of AI are not without m erit, and it is m aking incredible leaps in science that can help hum anity in astonishing ways, but itâ€™s usage
of our creative selves to generate half-baked approxim ations of our creativity sim ply saps the soul of what it is to be hum an. Why m ust we
outsource our joy and spirit to a soulless m achine?
We im plore you to not allow this to be the future of creativity and art.
