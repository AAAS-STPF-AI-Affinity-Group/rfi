General Comment
"AI" is overhyped and a scam . It does nothing and gives nothing of value. It's all bad data. Investing in it will worsen Am erica as a whole
and put us in a weaker position against those that don't use it. It does not have a place in the future of the US or anywhere else, and soon
enough will be yet another fad passing by. It steals the livelihood of actual working Am ericans so foreign powers can profit.
