General Comment
It is not a good idea to let AI databases scrape copyrighted m aterial, because it doesn't fall under fair use.
It is not transform ative in the slightest, because of the fact that AI would take in non-transform ative m aterial as the input.
Not only that, but it is unethical towards creatives who m ake art. Allowing copyrighted m aterial into the database could allow com panies
to steal som eone's art, train their database on that art, and the like without even paying said artist their rightful loyalties
