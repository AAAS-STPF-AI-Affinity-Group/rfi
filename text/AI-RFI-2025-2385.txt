General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica whatsoever. Not only has it been proven tim e & tim e again that it has
plagiarized m any different works (such as digital artwork, online articles published to websites, writings/scripts, etc.), but it also has been
used for deeply m alicious purposes, such as to create vulgar or explicit im ages of well-known celebrities & figures. It also has been used
to create digital replications of norm al people; if an individual wanted to, they could very easily generate content of said person engaging in
acts that are deem ed crim inal, vulgar or explicit in nature, deeply violating the privacy of one's life and potentially causing nothing but
em otional turm oil upon them .
