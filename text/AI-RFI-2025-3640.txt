General Comment
This is going to destroy the industry that's creating the very data you want to collect. Intellectual property laws were m ade for the purpose
of incentivizing creators to share their work knowing it would not be stolen; allowing AIs to scrape people's work without their perm ission
will dram atically reduce the num ber of people interested in m aking novel works.
