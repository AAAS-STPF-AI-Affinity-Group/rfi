General Comment
We cannot allow any generative AI m odel to be “trained” on property that belongs to others. AI should not be allowed to run ram pant
and steal from  any source it can gain access to. This would be blatantly stealing from  the creators and artists of Am erica as well as from
those around the world. A person or entity utilizing the content m ade by others without their consent or even awareness to create a “new”
product would be widely accepted as unethical and corrupt, yet it’s being proposed that generative AI be allowed to do essentially that.
It’s clear by what generative AI has produced in these recent years that it is overall detrim ental to the public availability of inform ation on
the internet and, in turn, the Am erican people. It m ass-produces near worthless im agery that floods im age search engines and has had a
m assive hand in contributing to the ram pant spread of m isinform ation. I have witnessed firsthand this rising tide of m isinform ation and the
alarm ing am ount of people, on m ultiple social m edia platform s, who believe without second thought that AI generated content is real. Out
of concern for the world we are curating by allowing this to happen without regulation, I beg that we please reconsider granting generative
AI and those who own these m odels the power to take whatever they please without consequence. This technology m ust be regulated
and the rights of Am ericans m ust be put above the rights of AI.
