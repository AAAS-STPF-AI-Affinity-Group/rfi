General Comment
The fifth am endm ent of the United States Constitution stipulates that no property is to be taken or used without com pensation from
citizens. Though I am  skeptical of how m uch the current adm inistration takes stock in the Constitution, I nonetheless will post this publicly
so that when these rights are inevitably revoked or tram pled upon, at least one m ore person will perhaps be inform ed as to what we have
lost.
