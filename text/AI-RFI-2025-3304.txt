General Comment
I work for the George Washington University in a position responsible for the college's supercom puters. AI is an incredibly resource
hungry, m orally grey technology that cannot and should not steal from  copyritten m aterial to the benefit of shareholders at the expense of
the average person. Do not allow this to continue, as giving a blank cheque here is a slippery slope.
