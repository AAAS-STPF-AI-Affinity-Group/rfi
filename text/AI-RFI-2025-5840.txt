General Comment
AI is not necessary or desirable for the best possible future of the United States. It’s training requires stealing & it’s product often
plagiarizes or is vastly inferior to actual hum ans. The energy usage is another reason to object to AI. Most people do not want this. The
people who do want it seek to profit from  it. AI doesn’t need training. The people behind it need to stop stealing & overhyping it.
