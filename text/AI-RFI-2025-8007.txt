General Comment
We do not need AI to succeed, and it has proven to be unreliable, frequently producing m isinform ation and outright lies. Aside from  the
obvious issues of not working well enough for any m ass usage, it relies on theft and copyright infringem ent to produce anything at all,
stealing m oney from  both big businesses and sm all ones alike.
Allowing AI to steal data would not only weaken our econom y by m aking data and processes m ore difficult, it also weakens our m ilitary,
law enforcem ent, and other governm ental bodies by obfuscating true, reliable inform ation and their direct sources.
Do not allow this blatant theft to continue.
