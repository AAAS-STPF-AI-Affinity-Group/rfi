This administration is not doing anything on behalf of the American People. They are doing 
everything selfishly and for the elite, but you know that. None of the executive orders passed by this administration are meant to do anything less than dismantle th e last remaining shred of a 
government for the people. I hope the world hold you all to account and punish you to the greatest extent of the global law.
