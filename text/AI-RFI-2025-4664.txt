General Comment
Open AI has built itself up by stealing from  m illions of m ore creative individuals who actually have the skill to create them selves. They have
no right to profit off of the work they've only gotten access to through theft, and without proper com pensation of those who create that
base data. This giant com pany is already in the wrong and hundreds of lawsuit that are clearly not going their way are proof. You can't just
steal som ething and take credit for building it. AI is NOT the future for the US.
