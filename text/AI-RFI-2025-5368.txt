General Comment
AI as it exists should have no future in these United States. As a writer, I see the products m arketed as AI as nothing m ore than theft,
relying on stealing the works of m yself and artists and journalists like m e and m y com m unities for profit while failing to live up to AI
investors' and designers' claim s.
Private property rights, including intellectual property rights, as well as contractual relationships and obligations underpin Am erica's legal
system  and are indeed part of why the nation was founded. The plan requested will violate the intellectual property rights of all Am ericans-
-anyone who has ever written (their works are protected by copyright!), everyone who has shared a photograph or other visual artwork
(their works are protected by copyright!), everyone who has shared their m usic (their works are protected by copyright!). Anything that
can be digitized will be stolen for the enrichm ent of those investing in AI while providing little of value in return.
I am  against providing im m unity to copyright and other intellectual property lawsuits to OpenAI and all other AI com panies. These
com panies are obligated to act within the boundaries of law just like all other US entities--and that m eans contracting with individuals and
organizations whose content they wish to use as training m aterial.
