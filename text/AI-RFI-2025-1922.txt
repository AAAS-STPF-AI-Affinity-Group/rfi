General Comment
I strongly disagree with this m otion. It is m ore to rob the Am erican people of their innovative creative edge that has lead us to have such a
presence culturally. Hollywood exists because of Am erican innovation in story telling. We need to keep stories hum an to keep pushing
that forward.
