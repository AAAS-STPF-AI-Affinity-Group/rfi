General Comment
No one individual or thing should be com pletely im m une from  the legal process. If generative Ai is supposedly "beneficial" for the world,
then why does it require legal im m unity from  the due process of law? If som eone feels that their rights are being violated, they deserve to
be able to take action. What kind of country is "for the people" when it actively works against the people by restricting what they can do
to protect them selves and their property? If com panies selling food were protected from  lawsuits about food poisoning, then that leaves an
open door for them  to cause food poisoning without any punishm ent.
