There is a common argument in favor of generative AI that its creation process can be likened to 
a per son receiving inspiration for their own projects. For example: if a person looks at a painting 
of a polar bear, then they decide they want to make their own painting of a polar bear, is that not the same as Generative AI using a picture of a polar bear to generate an image of a polar bear? This argument is a slippery slope that many fall into, merely because they do not understand the creative process. It i mplies that for people creating art, this one piece is the linchpin that holds 
together the new piece of art, that without this one singular piece, it would not exist. Quite the contrary: there are countless pieces of artwork that individuals are inspired by every day, so even 
if that one picture of a polar bear was taken away, there would be other pieces that can inspire an individual. Generative AI, meanwhile, requires these individual pieces in order to function. No matter how complicated Generative AI m ay seem to people, it is a tool. It does not replicate the 
human brain and it is not sapient nor sentient: it is a tool. A human took images from the internet and fed them into a machine to generate an output. It is math, A + B = C. So when Generative AI utilizes material made by an artist to create a product, it would not exist without that artist's hard work -- and if Generative AI is used to cut expenses from an animation studio, it is actively stealing money from the individuals it stole from. Myself and my friends are all creatives in one way or another: writers, coders, artists, musicians. We all stand against Generative AI. I personally argue that if organizations such as Generative AI wish to continue their program, purge the current database and hav e individuals and organizations submit works to be included, 
not to have them taken without consent.
