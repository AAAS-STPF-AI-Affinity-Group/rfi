General Comment
AI is m ore of a security risk than a security benefit to the United States of Am erica's people and businesses, and is an inefficient use of
resources in m ost applications of its use. I do not believe that that allowing m ore access to data will alleviate these issues, and will instead
m ake them  worse.
