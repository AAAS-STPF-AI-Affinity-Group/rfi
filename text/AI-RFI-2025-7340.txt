General Comment
The ability of a com pany to profitably 
m ake a product or service without blatant wholesale disregard for copyright and other intellectual property law is not a "burdensom e
requirem ent". Generative Models (com m only m islabeled as AI) with excellent can be created without pilfering copyrighted m aterial. If the
current com panies utilizing such kleptocratic practices are unable to do so without honoring the fundam entals of copyright, they should be
relegated to the dustbin of history.
