General Comment
It is sincerely im portant to everyone that copyrights are protected from  AI training. Failure to do so would result in a unstable m arket
where instead of buying som eone's work, AI would be used to replicate the work in a slightly altered form  without the owner's
perm ission. Hum an labor would not sim ply be replaced, but rather stolen and used without providing the proper recom pense. If AI cannot
exist without infringing on the rights of m illions of people to their own work, it should not exist.
