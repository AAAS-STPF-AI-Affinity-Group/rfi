General Comment
There are not enough regulations regarding AI. the thought of rolling back what few things are in place to protect people's art, lives, and
personal data ... Absolutely astonishing. 
AI isn't "sm art" it's a com plete waste of resources. There are already tools to do the things AI is trying to replace, and AI is so so so so
m uch m ore harm ful for the planet than things like... Doing your own Google search. 
The Am erican people do not want to freely give data to corporations that are already causing harm  so they can create m ore harm ! 
the idea that AI is the way forward is childish and an absolute ignorance of the state of clim ate change on our entire planet.
We only have one planet. We need to take care of it.
