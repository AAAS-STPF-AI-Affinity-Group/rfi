Should AI Be Capable of Forgetting? Strengthening Copyright in the Age of Generative AI
If generative AI (GenAI) truly “thinks” like a hum an, then it should also be capable of “forgetting” like one. While AI does not possess
m em ory in the hum an sense, AI m odels that have been trained on copyrighted works without consent should be required to “unlearn”
them , ensuring that creators retain full control over their intellectual property.
To regulate generative AI effectively within a capitalist fram ework (at least without stifling the industry around generative AI entirely)
copyright laws m ust be strengthened. AI com panies offering for-profit generative m odels should be legally required to im plem ent
m echanism s that rem ove copyrighted content upon request, giving artists, authors, and other creators m eaningful recourse.
Copyright & Ownership in AI-Generated Works
AI-generated works should be eligible for copyright protection only when they involve significant hum an creative input. Sim ple text
prom pts without m eaningful post-processing should not qualify. While quantifying creativity is challenging, a threshold of at about 50%
hum an m odification—through editing, refinem ent, or artistic transform ation—should be required for copyright eligibility.
All AI-generated outputs that fail to m eet this standard should be classified as non-copyrightable and m ade publicly available, except in
cases of copyright infringem ent. Outputs that violate copyright laws should not be sold or m onetized in any form , while those that do not
infringe m ay be com m ercialized but m ust be labeled as AI-generated.
Additionally, AI-generated works that have been significantly interpolated, whether redrawn, repainted, or otherwise substantially
transform ed, should be eligible for copyright protection, provided they are truly unique and not replicable through the sam e prom pt. This
ensures that hum an creative effort rem ains central to intellectual property rights in the AI era.
Protecting Hum an Creatives from  Direct Com petition with AI
Artists, authors, and creatives should not be forced into direct com petition with generative AI m odels, as this would devalue hum an
creativity and underm ine professional opportunities. Safeguarding creative industries requires fair m arket practices and clear regulations on
the com m ercial use of AI-generated content, including:
- Mandatory Disclosure of AI Use: Com panies utilizing AI-generated works should be required to clearly disclose when and how AI is
used. This transparency allows consum ers and businesses to m ake inform ed decisions and prevents AI-generated content from  being
m isrepresented as hum an-m ade.
- Restricting AI in Fields Where Hum an Creativity Is Integral: AI-generated content should not be used to replace hum an labor in
industries where artistic vision and craftsm anship are essential. For exam ple, AI-generated illustrations should not be directly substituted
for com m issioned artwork unless explicitly agreed upon by all involved parties.
- Incentives for Hum an-Made Creative Content: Governm ents should offer grants, tax breaks, or subsidies for businesses and platform s
that prioritize hum an-m ade creative works over AI-generated alternatives. This would help sustain and strengthen creative industries,


encouraging investm ent in hum an talent rather than relying solely on AI-generated content.
Fair Licensing Agreem ents for AI Training
Building on the concept of AI “unlearning” or rem oving copyrighted content, licensing agreem ents between copyright or intellectual
property holders and AI com panies should be fair, reasonable, and non-exploitative. These agreem ents should follow key principles:
- Reasonable Licensing Term s & Com pensation: AI com panies should be required to secure proper licensing agreem ents before using
copyrighted works for training. These agreem ents should ensure fair financial com pensation and reasonable tim efram es.
- No Forced Transfers of Full Rights: AI com panies should only obtain full rights to an artist’s, author’s, or creator’s work with their
explicit and voluntary agreem ent. No creator should be pressured into perm anently surrendering their rights to AI developers under
exploitative term s.
- The Right to Revoke or Renegotiate Term s: Copyright holders should retain the ability to renegotiate or revoke agreem ents as AI
technology evolves. This prevents creators from  being locked into outdated or unfair agreem ents.
So in the end, if AI “unlearning” proves to be a challenge, the ethical and legal principles behind it are very valid.
Many of the proposed m easures, like fair licensing, and disclosure requirem ents, are not dependent on whether AI can truly forget and
should be im plem ented regardless, as they ensure creative professionals can continue to thrive alongside genAI m odels.
