To the National Science Foundation and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, 
Unchecked innovation risks consolidating power in the hands of a few, deepening inequality, 
and leaving millions of Americans behind. Without strong, responsible oversight, this 
transformative technology could exacerbate our nation’s challenges rather than elevate 
its potential. 
My name is Carissa Lintao, and I’ve spent my career at the intersection of technology and 
advertising, working with some of the most recognized brands and entrepreneurs in the world.  
As the founder of Apptuitive, an industry-leading firm specializing in mobile growth, I have 
helped scale million-dollar companies and advised high-growth startups on how to build 
businesses that are both ethical and profitable. I’ve worked with Techstars, Inflection AI, and 
BD, and my insights on innovation have been featured in Forbes, TEDx, and major industry 
publications. 
Beyond my work, my perspectives on innovation are rooted in how I learned to think. Being 
homeschooled demonstrated that powerful learning occurs in environments that cultivate 
critical thinking, autonomy, and the ability to see beyond the obvious. Mastery comes from 
sensing what others overlook, questioning assumptions, and adapting with precision in the face of uncertainty. 
This philosophy shapes how I approach business and technology. True innovation goes beyond 
efficiency and scale—it’s about m aking 
strategic, responsible choices that both push industries 
forward while creating lasting, profitable impact. 
The truth behind my work: Responsible innovation reflects integrity and the potential for 
being the most profitable choice as well.  
Beyond a technological breakthrough, AI is an economic force multiplier that will define 
America’s global market position in the coming decade. When the United States leads AI, it will 
control trillions of dollars in economic value, making it a strategic priority for both business and 
national competitiveness.  
However, without strategic oversight, AI risks being consolidated by a handful of large 
corporations, limiting its benefits to small businesses and emerging entrepreneurs. Our 
country must ensure that AI remains a catalyst for broad-based economic growth rather than 
a tool for market consolidation. 
America has always met every challenge with strength. AI is our next great test. I trust this 
administration will make it a priority, and I stand ready to help shape the future. Let’s not just 
“make America great” – let’s keep it great. 
Below are my recommendations for tackling the challenges we face. 
1 


1. AI Will Replace Jobs and America Must Be Ready  
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, predicts that AI will eliminate 70-80% of current jobs—yet 
his company, and others in the space, fail to provide any roadmap for how workers 
will transition in an AI-driven economy.    
This existential challenge cannot be ignored.  
The current reality:  
More than half of Americans currently read below a sixth-grade level. ( APM 
Research Lab ) 
This directly means m ost of the workforce is not prepared for AI disruption, nor are 
business owners equipped with strategies for integrating AI while maintaining jobs or 
creating new ones. 
Education and workforce training must evolve immediately, or else AI’s reshaping of 
the economy will leave millions of Americans behind. 
 
This concern impacts several areas: Education for children who represent future workers as 
well as issues for entrepreneurs, small business owners, and workers across countless 
industries. AI literacy must become as fundamental as reading, writing, and arithmetic. 
 
Without a comp letely premeditated shift in our education system, our country will not 
keep up and will be left behind. 
 
Recommendations:  
National AI Literacy & Workforce Readiness Initiative 
AI literacy is fragmented, with no universal standards. K-12 programs are not mandatory, 
community college AI courses are scarce, and workforce retraining is inconsistent. Small 
business owners lack access to AI education, leaving them at a competitive disadvantage. 
Key Solutions 
● Integrate AI Literacy into F ederal Education Funding – Update Title IV-A grants to 
support AI curriculum & teacher training. 
● AI Teacher Training Nationwide – Ensure every K-12 school has AI-ready educators. 
● Expand AI Workforce Programs – Scale NSF-backed AI training for community 
colleges in all 50 states. 
● Establish a Standardized AI Literacy Framework – Define essential AI skills across 
2 


education levels and industries. 
● Upskill Entrepreneurs & Workers – Fund AI training for small business owners and 
workers. 
● Public-Private Workforce Transition Programs – Develop real-world AI training with 
corporate partners. 
Who Trains Them & What Is Their Training Criteria? 
For the National AI Literacy & Workforce Readiness Initiative to be effective, AI educators 
and trainers must be equipped with the right expertise, frameworks, and methodologies. The 
success of this initiative depends on who trains them, how they are trained, and what 
standards define AI literacy across different industries and education levels. 
Who Trains Them? 
1. AI Industry Experts & Researchers  – Professionals from leading AI organizations, 
universities, and research institutions who specialize in AI development, ethics, and applications. 
2. Certified Educators & STEM Trainers – K-12 teachers, college professors, and vocational trainers who undergo AI-specific training programs to integrate AI education 
into standard curricula. 
3. Corporate AI Practitioners – AI professionals from companies like OpenAI, Google, 
Microsoft, and IBM who provide real-world AI insights and applications. 
4. Public-P rivate P
artnerships – Government-backed AI training programs developed in 
collaboration with major corporations and education organizations to align workforce needs with AI skill development. 
5. NSF-Backed AI Training Programs – Community college instructors and workforce 
trainers who receive funding and certification to provide AI training in local economies. 
What Is Their Training Criteria? 
To ensure AI literacy is standardized and effective, a structured  train
ing framework must be 
established  to cover: 
1. Foundational AI Knowledge – Understanding AI principles, machine learning basics, 
data ethics, and responsible AI use. 
2. AI in the Workforce – How AI impacts different industries, automation trends, and 
strategies for workforce adaptation. 
3. AI Tools & Applications – Training on commonly used AI platforms, automation tools, 
and decision-making systems. 
4. Hands-On AI Im plementation  – Real-world projects and case studies to apply AI 
knowledge in business, education, and innovation. 
5. Continuous Learning & Certification  – AI literacy is constantly evolving, requiring 
ongoing training and certification to stay up to date. 
By training educators, entrepreneurs, and workers with a clear AI literacy framework, this 
initiative ensures that AI becomes an economic equalizer—empowering businesses, students, and the workforce to adapt, innovate, and compete.

National AI Awareness & Skills Campaign 
The federal government should spearhead a nationwide AI education campaign, as 
recommended by the National AI Advisory Committee (ai.gov). This “AI for All” initiative would 
provide: 
● Free AI learning modules for students, workers, and entrepreneurs.
● Public education efforts through libraries, museums, and media.● Online courses and community workshops demystifying AI.
My firm, Apptuitive, with its expertise in marketing, consumer engagement, and behavior-driven 
communication, understands how to bridge the AI 
knowledge gap effectively. We propose 
leading a National AI Literacy & Public Awareness Digital Campaign—ensuring small 
businesses, entrepreneurs, and workers have the practical knowledge and resources to 
navigate AI’s impact. 
2. AI Becoming a Market Monopoly Poses a Both a National Security
and Domestic Economic Threat
A handful of corporations control AI infrastructure, talent, and data—giving them unchecked 
power to dictate who benefits from AI and who gets locked out.   
This consolidation poses severe risks: 
●Small businesses are excluded , lacking access to critical AI technology.
●Innovation is stifled , as monopolies control who builds and at what scale.
●National security is at risk, with AI-driven decision-making concentrated in the hands
of a few entities.
Compounding this issue, Big Tech platforms currently allow anonymous developers to operate 
unchecked. 
This unchecked flood of unverified AI applications threatens consumer trust, national security, 
and U.S. innovation. Without safeguards, bad actors exploit systems. To maintain global AI 
leadership, the government must enforce stricter developer verification and accountability.   
Recommendation:  
●Apple and G oogle must no longer allow anonymous AI developers to operate in
the App Store.
To ensure a competitive and secure AI ecosystem, the government must im plement policies that 
promote responsibility.

3. AI Must Be Pro-Innovation, But That Means Solving Real 
Needs—Not Manufactured Ones  
AI-driven businesses should solve real problems, not just create artificial demand 
through manipulation.  
Currently, AI is being used to:  
● Amplify consumer addiction loops rather than solve actual user needs. 
● Drive hyper-personalized advertising, exploiting consumers without their 
informed consent.  
● Replace human decision-making in ways that weaken rather than enhance 
intelligence.  
Advertising illiteracy is a critical issue—m ost consumers do not understand how AI-driven 
advertising manipulates their behavior. AI should enhance the market. Instead, it manufactures 
demand by preying on consumer vulnerabilities.   
Additionally, entrepreneurial leadership training is lacking. AI best drives true innovation when 
business leaders are effectively equipped to use it. Right now, most small business owners do 
not understand AI, most have still not adapted to social media, and there is little training 
available for them.  
Recommendations:  
● Ensure AI funding prioritizes solutions that solve real business and consumer 
needs—not just engagement-driven m odels.  
● 
Increase AI literacy in business and advertising to prevent market 
manipulation at scale.  
● Expand entrepreneurial leadership training programs to ensure business 
owners understand AI’s role in their industries.  
 Without a responsible approach, AI risks becoming a tool for manufacturing demand rather 
than driving genuine, sustainable economic progress.  
Together we can foster innovation that solves real problems, or accelerate consumer 
manipulation, short-term gratification, and economic inefficiencies. 
 
If left unchecked, this 
cycle will not only erode market integrity but also deepen societal 
disengagement— continuing to accelerate a diminishing sense of purpose—on an 
unprecedented scale.  
 AI is reshaping our understanding of meaning itself. Choices are being made for consumers, their desires molded by prediction engines that are built for engagement, not fulfillment.   
5 


Creators are in no better shape. When AI can generate, automate, and optimize faster than 
creators can think, what’s left to create? When everything is designed for attention, nothing is 
built for meaning in the present time.  
This matters because attention and meaning are not the same currency. Attention is fleeting. 
Meaning is enduring.   
The result? A world where both consumers and creators feel like cogs in a system they 
can’t escape, questioning whether their work, their desires— even their thoughts—truly 
matter. 
And here you are, sifting through, most likely, AI-generated insights, attempting to craft an action 
plan that doesn’t just sound good — but means something.  
The real answer to this A I plan of action isn’t m ore efficiency — it’s meaning.  
That is our challenge.  
 
 
4. Attracting and Retaining Top Talent Best Results From A Values-Driven 
Culture 
As entrepreneurship and technology become more accessible, the competition for exceptional 
talent intensifies. The most skilled professionals are increasingly drawn to companies that 
prioritize and authentically live by their core values. When trust is compromised, employees 
are quick to "jump ship," leading to significant challenges in retention.  
Recent studies highlight this trend:  
● A 2024 WorkProud study found that only 23% of workers aged 42 years or younger 
expressed a strong interest in remaining with their current employers long term. This figure drops to 18% for workers aged 30 years or younger. [prnewswire.com] 
● Research indicates that companies with a clear commitment to their values attract and 
retain top talent, benefiting from a motivated workforce. [forbes.com ] 
As barriers to entry in business continue to diminish—through advancements like AI, no-code 
solutions, and increased access to capital—the ability 
to build something is no longer the 
primary differentiator. The true competitive edge lies in attracting and retaining exceptional 
minds. The strongest players in this new landscape are those who are deeply self-aware and 
actively seek companies with al igned values. Skills can be taught, and capital can be raised, but 
a company’s values—its core m ission, treatment of people, and the culture it 
fosters—determine whether it attracts top-tier talent or repels it.  
This underscores a fundamental truth: People make or break a company. The best 
entrepreneurs and executives have always understood this, but we are now entering an era 
where it is non-negotiable. Companies that thrive will be those that build environments of 
6 


trust, responsibility, and alignment—not just with customers, but with their own people.  
In the past, companies could prioritize profit over people because employees had fewer 
alternatives. Compensation was the primary differentiator—if a company paid well, it could 
attract top talent, even with questionable culture or ethics. 
But as AI becomes democratized and the playing field levels, that equation will shift. Right now, 
salaries in AI-driven industries are astronomical, but this won’t last forever. As AI tools become 
more accessible and widespread, companies will no longer be able to compete purely on 
compensation. The gap will tighten. The differentiating factor will shift from who pays the 
most to who aligns with p eople’s values the most. 
At the same time, accountability will become more intense. As digital transparency increases 
and AI makes it easier to track and analyze corporate behaviors in real time, employees won’t 
just question a company’s values—they’ll fear being associated with the wrong brand and group 
of people. We may reach a point where working for a company or government agency with 
“ethical blind spots” carries per sonal and professional risk. Theoretically speaking, a single 
AI-generated report exposing poor labor practices, environmental negligence, or biased 
decision-making could make an entire workforce radioactive. 
This means companies can no longer afford to treat values as a PR exercise. The era of 
performative ethics is ending. The AI arm s race will give way to a values arms race—one where 
companies and governments that genuinely align their technology and operations with trust, 
fairness, and integrity will attract and retain top talent, while those that cut ethical corners will struggle to attract the mi nds they seek. 
The real competitive advantage won’t just be in having AI but in  h
ow AI is used. Are we 
automating in ways that enhance human creativity, or just cutting costs? Is leadership 
transparent about how AI decisions are made? Are we using AI to build a future people actually want to be a part of? 
Recommendations:  
1. Operationalize Core Values – Move beyond slogans by embedding values into
hiring, AI governance, and technology itself. Conduct regular audits to ensureleadership and teams uphold these values through real decisions, not just in
messaging.
2. Mandate Leadership Training & Accountability – Require all leaders to complete
decision-making training, participate in bias mitigation workshops, 
and be held
accountable through a public-facing mechanism. Establish an AI ethics task force to
prevent reputational risk. This ensures proactive AI transparency and responsible use.
By executing these steps, companies and governments secure trust, attract top talent, and maintain a competitive edge in an era where values define long-term success. 
5. “Kind Innovator” –  Incentivizing Ethical Leadership in AI
7 


 
In 2018, I traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet Megan Smith, former United States Chief 
Technology Officer. We had a long conversation about technology and ethics, and at the 
end, she handed me a coin. 
For me, this coin was not just a symbol—it was a call to action, selectively gifted to changemakers committed to using science, technology, and innovation to advance the well-being of the American people.  
In that moment, she did not just hand me a coin—she handed me a profound sense of 
responsibility.  
Seven years later, that responsibility remains at the core of everything I do. 
 
 
 
 
  The Problem: An Industry Without Guardrails 
  
Today, the elephant in the room is our government struggling to navigate an AI-driven world 
where industry leaders operate like children in a candy store with limitless resources and no 
oversight.  
 
The unchecked pursuit of profit has outpaced our ethical frameworks, leaving us at risk of 
irresponsible innovation that serves pockets, not people. 
It is time for the U.S. government to set the standard for responsibility and accountability 
in AI. That starts at the top.

How do you incentivize good behavior in these “god amongst men” individuals when the 
“ultimate incentive” – money – is a seemingly infinite resource? 
The answer?: Immortality. 
The Solution: “Kind Innovator” – A New Standard for Leadership 
The Kind Innovator program recognizes and incentivizes business leaders who embody 
America’s core values—integrity, responsibility, and ethical innovation. 
Throughout history, we have admired and immortalized individuals like Abraham Lincoln, Martin 
Luther King Jr., and George W ashington Carver—not just for their influence, but for their 
sacrifice and unwavering commitment to doing what’s right, even when they didn’t have to. 
Everyone wants to be these leaders, but too few are willing to act like them. 
Now, at the forefront of AI’s transformation, we need leaders willing to shape this new era—not 
just for profit, but for progress. 
This is the program America needs to operate. It is time for the United States to take back the 
narrative—not that success alone makes you great, but that America makes you great. 
Call to Action: A Government-Led Initiative to Set the Tone for AI’s Future 
By elevating and rewarding responsible leadership, we can shift the incentive structure—making 
legacy, not just wealth, the true measure of success. 
This program transcends ethics while being part of something far greater than oneself. 
The greatest innovators and leaders don’t just want to accumulate wealth—they want to be 
remembered. They want their names engraved into history. Being recognized by America itself 
cements individual success and potentially solidifies their place in the nation’s legacy. 
Kind Innovator offers a distinction reserved for those seeking to shape not just 
industries, but civilization itself. There would be strict criteria, ensuring that only the 
most forward-thinking, responsible, and visionary leaders earn their place among the 
architects of America's AI-driven future. 
Done right, this becomes the ultimate aspirational benchmark – from a young girl 
studying chemistry in  4th grade to the next industry titan—a mark of honor that money 
alone can’t buy. 
Final Thought: AI Must Serve America’s Business and Workforce Interests  
AI should not be a force that dictates the future—it should be a tool that empowers Americans 
9 


to build it. The true measure of AI’s success will not be in how quickly it advances, but in how 
effectively it creates new opportunities, strengthens businesses, and elevates the American 
workforce.  
To ensure that AI strengthens the U.S. economy, it must be positioned as: 
●A catalyst for economic expansion —empowering businesses of all sizes to scale and
innovate, rather than consolidating power within a select few corporations.
●A driver of job creation —enhancing workforce capabilities, fostering skill
development, and creating new opportunities, rather than displacing workers without a
clear path forward.
●A strategic advantage for American businesses—boosting productivity,
increasing global competitiveness, and ensuring that the U.S. remains the leader inAI-driven industries.
This administration has a critical role in shaping the national perception of AI—not as an 
existential threat, but as an opportunity for all Americans to participate in and benefit from. AI should not be something that intimidates the public or widens the knowledge gap—it should 
be a tool for empowerment, economic mobility, and innovation.  
This happens when Americans are equipped with the education and resources necessary 
to engage with AI meaningfully. T his 
happens when this administration positions itself to 
positively act on its responsibility to position the American people for success. To elevate 
national literacy, foster entrepreneurial thinking, and provide clear pathways for workforce adaptation.  
Our legacy cannot be conditional and limited based on half of us reading below a 
sixth-grade level. If this gap is not addressed, AI will not be an opportunity—it will be an 
insurmountable barrier.  
This administration must choose: Shape AI into a force that uplifts our people and 
businesses, or allow  
it to widen economic and educational gaps that will leave 
millions behind.  
This administration has the unique opportunity to set the entire tone for the personal and 
cultural perception of AI. Don’t let “AI” overwhelm the American people. Use it to fuel a stronger 
economy, a skilled workforce, and a more prosperous future for all. Together we can make AI the next iteration of the ongoing American Dream.  
Please consider my involvement – with my trusted partners – in the shaping of your AI policy 
going forward. Let’s discuss at your earliest convenience.  
Thank you for your time.
