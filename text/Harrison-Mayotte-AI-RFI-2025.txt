Introduction:
My name is Harrison Mayotte, and I am the President of MetroGov Solutions Inc., a Massachusetts -
based company dedicated to modernizing municipal operations through scalable, efficient, and secure 
technology solutions. My background in local government administration, technology infrastructure, and 
public p olicy informs my perspective on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in government operations.
As the National Science Foundation (NSF) develops its AI Action Plan, I strongly encourage a focus on 
practical AI applications that improve government effic iency , protect taxpayer dollars, and enhance 
transparency , while ensuring strong security and accountability in AI deployment.
Key Priorities for AI in Local Government
1.AI for Government Efficiency and Smart Resource Allocation
Many municipalities, espe cially in Massachusetts and across the country , face budgetary constraints 
and administrative inefficiencies. AI presents an opportunity to streamline services while reducing 
operational costs, particularly in:
Permitting & Licensing: AI-driven automation can significantly reduce approval and processing
times, making it easier for businesses and residents to navigate government processes.
Document & Records Management: AI-enhanced classification and retrieval systems can hel p
government entities meet compliance requirements while improving government transparency .
Fraud Detection & Waste Reduction: AI-based anomaly detection can help identify inefficiencies
and fraud, preventing the misuse of taxpayer dollars.
Recommendation: AI funding should prioritize solutions that reduce bureaucratic burdens, eliminate 
redundant processes, and allow municipalities to do more with fewer resources.
2. Ethical and Secure AI Deployment in Government
For AI to be trusted in government operatio ns, its use must be transparent, accountable, and secure. 
Critical considerations include:
Government Decision- Making Transparency: AI systems used in zoning, permitting, and
compliance must be explainable and auditable, preventing biased or arbitrary deci sions.

sensitive municipal and citizen data is protected from both domestic and international cyber
threats.
Accountability & Oversight: AI systems should be designed with clear human oversight
mechanisms to prevent unintended negative consequences in governance.
Recommendation: NSF should support AI governance frameworks that prioritize security , 
transparency , and accountability , ensuring public trust in AI-driven g overnment operations.
3.AI, Economic Growth, and National Competitiveness
The United States must maintain its leadership in AI innovation while ensuring AI policies support 
economic growth and job creation at all levels of government. T o achieve this, fed eral AI policy must:
Encourage Private -Sector Innovation: AI development should be driven by the private sector ,
with governments adopting cost -effective, off -the-shelf AI solutions rather than developing
expensive in -house models.
Ensure National Security in AI Supply Chains: The government must prioritize U.S. -developed
AI models and reduce reliance on foreign AI infrastructure, particularly from adversarial nations.
Support Small and Mid -Sized Municipalities: Many local governments lack the funding for AI
adoption —targeted federal AI funding can help them modernize without unfunded mandates.
Recommendation: The AI Action Plan should promote responsible AI adoption in government while 
prioritizing economic competitiveness and national security .
4.AI Funding: Ensuring ROI and Local Control
AI adoption at the municipal level should be pragmatic, cost -effective, and results -driven. The federal 
government should:
Support Public -Private Partnerships (PPPs): AI deployment in government should leverage
priva te-sector expertise rather than expand government bureaucracy .
Ensure AI Funding Demonstrates ROI: Federal AI grants should prioritize projects with
measurable efficiency gains and cost savings.
Avoid One -Size-Fits-All Regulations: AI should be implemented flexibly at the municipal level,
allowing local governments to choose solutions that work best for their communities.
Recommendation: The NSF should prioritize scalable, cost -effective AI investments that help local 
governments modernize while protecting fiscal responsibility .
Conclusion: AI Should Support Smarter , More Accountable Government
Artificial Intelligence has the potential to transform government operations —but only if it is implemented 
efficiently , ethically , and securely . The NSF’s AI Action Plan should:
1.Prioritize Government Efficiency –AI should reduce waste, streamline services, and optimize
government spending.
2.Ensure AI is Transparent & Secure –AI tools should be accountable, auditable, and protected
from cybersecurity threats.
3.Promote AI-Driven Economic Growth –AI adoption should support American businesses,
technological competitiveness, and local job creation.

improve government services withou t unnecessary expansion.
I appreciate the opportunity to provide input and look forward to the NSF’s leadership in advancing AI 
policy that strengthens government efficiency , economic growth, and national security .
Sincerely ,
Harrison Mayotte
