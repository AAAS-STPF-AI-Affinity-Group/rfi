General Comment
I work as an artist where m ore than 50% of m y work is protected by m y various em ployers but still can be publically viewed as m y own.
To see the sheer fleecing of the public on the views of AI as it continues to ravage m y industry is downright pathetic and disgraceful. AI
steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. If that alone does not im pact your views on AI then youâ€™ve already drank
the poisoned kool-aid. I will not sit idly by and watch m y work be used for AI purposes without m y perm ission.
