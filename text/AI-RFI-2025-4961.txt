General Comment
AI Corporations need to be held accountable and face consequences for their theft and copyright breaches of people and com panies all
over the country. They already profit off of and exploit the regular Am erican, m aking m illions of dollars. While those they steal from
struggle to survive, without the AI Corporations trying to replace their jobs.
Passing this AI action plan will only serve to m ake life for average Am ericans worse, while these already well off Corporations will profit
m ore and m ore with no rem orse or consequences.
