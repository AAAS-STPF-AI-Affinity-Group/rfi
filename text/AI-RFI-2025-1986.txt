General Comment
AI doesn't do anything that hum ans can't do better. It can't even function without consum ing tons of inform ation and art from  hum ans. It is
literally an algorithm  trained on our work, and it will not save you m oney in the long run because it will fall apart without constantly
consum ing new data-from  hum ans. There are literally so m any issues with AI just on a consum er level, so integrating it into im portant
system  will just results in catastrophic failure. Just hire people to do things, please.
