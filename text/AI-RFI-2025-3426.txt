General Comment
Thus far the only interactions I've had with GEN AI have been quite bad. 
I'm  friends and colleagues with several working artists who are afraid their work will be stolen by AI training off them  and from  what I can
tell, their fears are not unfounded. I've seen AI be used copy existing artistwork and or styles of popular artists. For all intents and
purposes its just tracing their work with extra steps and a high price tag. 
I also have econom ic concerns. AI seem s like a m oney furnace. We keep putting m ore resources in but little progress has actually been
m ade in the last 5 years. It's an interesting technology but all it has am ounted to so far is 
com puterized theft. I suspect it will go the way of NFT's in the next two years.
I don't think this is what the US governm ent should be spending any m oney
on AI at the m om ent. Given the current state of the econom y and trade war, I believe that m oney is better put elsewere.
