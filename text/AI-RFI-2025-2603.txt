General Comment
AI as com panies have been using it in the past four years has no place being federally subsidized by the united states of am erica. It is
bloated and inefficient, based on stolen intellectual property, and it brings little value while dem onstrably destroying the jobs of capable,
hard working am ericans. It needs to be restricted and m onitored, not encouraged. Generative AI has no right to be forced upon the
am erican people.
