General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. As a Freelance artist and illustrator, AI steals from  m y livelihood and, as an
Am erican citizen, allowing AI com panies to have full protection from  copyright rules give them  the ability to profit off of theft from  both m y
work and the work of other hard working Am erican citizens. 
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. While som e AI technologies can help people with issues like coding and
com ing up with com plex solutions, generative AI that OpenAI and Google are pushing are nothing but a scam  that just lines their pockets
with m oney, hurts hard working Am erican artists, and fills the Internet with poorly developed slop that m akes sources less reliable.
Am erica is supposed to be the land of freedom  and opportunity, but if OpenAI gets their way with this plan it will take away the
opportunity for every artist in the country from  achieving the Am erican dream .
