General Comment
AI training is intellectual theft, plain and sim ple. If m achine learning com panies want to use works to train AI m odels, they need to
LICENSE or OBTAIN PERMISSION LEGALLY to use the works of the m illions of artists, writers, and m usicians. Anything else is
plagiarism  in the highest degree.
