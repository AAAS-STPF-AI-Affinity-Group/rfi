PLC_RFI Response 31425


___________________________________________________________________________  
The Payments Leadership Council (PLC) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the  
Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) National 
Coordination Office (NCO)'s request for information (RFI) on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan ("Plan"). As a CEO -led organization representing the  world's 
leading payments networks —American Express, Discover, FIS, Fiserv, Mastercard, and Visa —
PLC is committed to expanding global commerce and driving inclusive growth by encouraging 
public policies that protect consumers, foster financial inclusion, a nd promote innovation and 
competition in payments.  
While payments companies have been using machine learning and AI to detect fraud and 
protect customers for decades, the integration of AI technologies has surged over recent years, 
enhancing efficiency, security, and user experience in many areas, includin g operations, risk 
management, and customer interactions. However, as financial institutions use AI to drive 
innovation, bad actors are also leveraging AI to perpetrate fraud, bypass security systems, and 
manipulate financial transactions. A coordinated an d adaptive regulatory approach is essential 
to protect American competitiveness and ensure that AI fosters trust, security, competition, and 
efficiency in financial services.  
The NITRD should proactively work with international, federal, and state regulators on AI 
oversight and regulation applicable to the financial sector. Without a coordinated national 
approach that promotes interoperability across jurisdictions and sectors, financial institutions 
and AI developers risk navigating a patchwork of inconsistent rules, leading to regulatory 
arbitrage, compliance inefficiencies, and potential security vulnerabilities.  
To ensure a unified, effective, and globally competitive AI regulatory environment, the federal 
government should develop a national flexible and risk -based AI governance framework to 
prevent regulatory arbitrage. To develop this framework, PLC recommends starting a public -
private working group to identify any areas where AI standards and regulations in the financial 
sector conflict, produce duplicative requirements, or leave gaps and identify the most potent 
risks to consumer trust and transparency. We rec ommend that the working group convenes 
quarterly and includes, but is not necessarily limited to:  
●Financial services providers
●AI developers and researchers
●Regulatory bodies


At the conclusion of the working group, the group should release a report outlining a coherent, 
coordinated framework for proposed national AI governance best practices unique to the 
financial services sector that both promote innovation and protect consum ers. By fostering 
continuous dialogue between regulators and industry leaders, the working group will help 
ensure that AI is leveraged in a way that enhances security, fosters competition, and protects 
consumers while maintaining U.S. leadership in financi al innovation.  
In addition, the U.S. must take the lead in working with global partners to shape global AI 
standards and governance frameworks that align with American interests and ensure 
competitive markets for U.S. financial services. As AI in the financial sector ope rates across 
borders and markets, it is essential that international regulatory coordination prioritizes U.S. 
leadership, innovation, and economic strength.  
To this end, the U.S. should continue to engage with the G7 and G20 working groups (and other 
international organizations and forums, as appropriate) to develop coordinated global AI 
governance policies. Coordination will help prevent conflicting AI regula tions that create barriers 
to cross -border financial transactions and disadvantage U.S. -based payments companies. 
Additionally, the U.S. should work with the IMF to prevent harm to American consumers in the 
global financial sector.  
Currently, in the United States and overseas, AI -related risks may be exacerbated without a 
uniform and nimble approach to regulation. In the United States, there is a growing patchwork of 
legislation at the state level, and the lack of a federal framework  risks creating disparate policies 
for enterprise use, which may ultimately adversely impact financial institutions, businesses 
(especially small businesses), and consumers. It is imperative that the US government help 
coordinate with stakeholders domestic ally and internationally to develop a framework that can 
be applied globally to ensure that AI deployment follows the "same activity, same risk, same 
regulation" principle.  
We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this critical discussion and welcome further 
engagement with the NITRD NCO as the AI Action Plan develops.
