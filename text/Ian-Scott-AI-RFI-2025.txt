This AI Action Plan is a disaster. Allowing AI to use materials regardless of copyright status
 puts millions of Americans at risk of losing security and jobs. People aren’t as interested in AI
as many corporations think. The masses will become jaded and angry, potentially resulting in
violence. This will only be exacerbated by the jobs lost to AI. Generative AI does not hold aplace in America’s future.
