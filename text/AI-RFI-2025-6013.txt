General Comment
Generative AI is a dead end
it is culturally a dead end and it is econom ically a dead end. There is no advantage in using it, never m ind that the only way it claim s to be
able to sustain itself is to be allowed around laws to illegally access m aterial protected under copyright. AI generated m aterial, cannot
create. They do not, form  som ething original, or of worth. No one likes it. The public roundly rejects engaging with it or products that use
it. It is a poison pill for any com pany's product to hear that it used generative AI. There is no gain in allowing it to run wild. If it was of any
value, it could sustain itself. And it cannot, which is why it is begging to be allowed to break Copyright Law. Let it die.
