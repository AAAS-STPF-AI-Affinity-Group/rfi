 Re:  Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
 Action Plan 
 Dear Mr. D’Souza, 
 The Internet Infrastructure Coalition (i2Coalition) appreciates the opportunity to submit 
 comments in response to the above-referenced Request for Information (RFI) regarding the 
 development of an AI Action Plan. i2Coalition represents the companies that build and maintain 
 the essential infrastructure of the Internet, including web hosting, data centers, cloud computing, 
 domain name services, and managed services. As the backbone of AI development and 
 deployment, our industry plays a critical role in ensuring that AI innovation is scalable, secure, 
 and globally competitive. 
 AI and the Role of Internet Infrastructure: 
 AI is increasingly dependent on the physical and digital infrastructure that our members provide. 
 AI models require robust computing power, data storage, and network bandwidth, all of which 
 are supported by the infrastructure sector. The AI Action Plan must account for the needs and 
 challenges faced by this sector to ensure that the United States remains the global leader in AI 
 development and deployment. 
 AI-Driven Network Security and Cyber Resilience: 
 AI is both a tool and a target in cybersecurity, and AI-powered network monitoring enhances 
 threat detection and mitigation. The AI Action Plan should encourage investment in AI-driven 
 cybersecurity for infrastructure providers and support international collaboration on AI security

 standards to prevent cyber threats targeting AI data centers and networks. Developing AI 
 governance frameworks that account for the risks of adversarial AI and model poisoning attacks 
 that threaten infrastructure integrity is critical. 
 Balanced Export Controls for AI Infrastructure: 
 AI infrastructure is a key competitive advantage for the U.S., and export control policies should 
 protect national security without hindering innovation. Export controls should be precisely 
 targeted to prevent adversarial access while maintaining the ability of U.S. companies to expand 
 AI infrastructure globally. Providing clear, transparent criteria for designating restricted 
 technologies is necessary to avoid uncertainty that could hinder investment in AI infrastructure. 
 Investing in AI-powered supply chain monitoring will help prevent illicit technology transfers 
 while enabling legitimate business operations. 
 Promoting Open and Interoperable AI Infrastructure: 
 AI relies on open Internet infrastructure and the ability to access publicly available data. The 
 U.S. must avoid overregulation that limits the ability of AI models to be trained on publicly 
 available data and ensure that U.S. data center policies align with global standards to maintain 
 interoperability. The U.S. should also push back against restrictive international policies, such as 
 excessive AI model licensing requirements, that disadvantage U.S. businesses. 
 Workforce Development for AI Infrastructure: 
 The growth of AI requires a skilled workforce capable of managing next-generation data 
 centers. The AI Action Plan should expand workforce training initiatives focused on data center 
 operations, AI model deployment, and cybersecurity. Supporting visa programs that allow AI 
 infrastructure companies to recruit highly skilled technical talent globally is necessary. 
 Additionally, investing in education programs that prepare workers for careers in AI 
 infrastructure, including data center management and cloud architecture, will help maintain the 
 industry's leadership. 
 Ensuring Sufficient Energy Resources for AI Workloads: 
 AI workloads are energy-intensive, requiring scalable and sustainable energy solutions for data 
 centers. The U.S. government should adopt policies that support investment in grid 
 modernization and transmission capacity to prevent bottlenecks in AI data processing. 
 Streamlined permitting for energy infrastructure supporting AI data centers, including nuclear 
 and renewable energy sources, is necessary. Additionally, equitable electricity pricing should be 
 maintained to prevent discriminatory rate structures that disproportionately burden AI 
 infrastructure providers.

 DISCUSSION DRAFT: DO NOT DISTRIBUTE 
 Conclusion: 
 As the foundation of AI innovation, the Internet infrastructure industry must be a key stakeholder 
 in AI policy development. i2Coalition urges the U.S. government to prioritize policies that 
 support AI infrastructure growth, enhance cybersecurity, and maintain America’s leadership in AI 
 development. We appreciate OSTP and NITRD NCO’s efforts to engage stakeholders in this 
 process and look forward to continued collaboration.
