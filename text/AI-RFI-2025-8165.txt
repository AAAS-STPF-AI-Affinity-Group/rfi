General Comment
I am  strongly agsinst this. 
Gen AI effectively is trying to circum vent copyright laws. The m odels were knowingly trained on work with copyright protections which
was already legally dubious. Big tech has raided the internet and is trying to change the rules to benefit them  at the expense of every single
person who has uploaded any im age online. 
If gen ai has a place in Am erican society it should be as a tool to help the creative industries, not replace them .
