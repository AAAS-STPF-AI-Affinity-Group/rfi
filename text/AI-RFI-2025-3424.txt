General Comment
Generative AI is a tool of fascists whose goal is to dism antle our dem ocracy and install a dictatorship in its place and lazy pseudo-
entrepreneurs who want great reward without putting in the work for it. Both of these ideals and the m en who represent them  - m ost
especially Donald Trum p and Elon Musk - com pletely fly in the face of the Am erican dream  and what our country is supposed to
represent.
