General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to blatantly steal data to train their algorithm s is both foolish and unethical. AI is not the future of hum anity. It's an
over-hyped tool. It's not intelligent. It m erely steals and regurgitates. This is an arm s race of idiocy. Rem oving OpenAI's guardrails will
only serve to let them  steal m ore data.
