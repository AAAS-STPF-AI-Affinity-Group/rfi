General Comment
I believe this law will only hurt hum an artists, anim ators, and writers because this would an ai program  to steal their work and use it
without any com pensation for the real people who actually put in their blood, sweat, and tears into their work. To let som ething that spits
on the very concept of creativity steal the creative works of real people from  around the world is an insult to everyone who has ever
created any form  of art or writing. Listen to those who put real effort into their work and donâ€™t let any ai steal the work of the real artist.
