General Comment
As an educator in public school, I can tell you that the idea of AI being needed in som e way is harm ful. I have already seen teenagers in
m y classroom  attem pting to use AI to do their research and work for them , and the results were dam aging. They had been given incorrect,
som etim es dangerous and bigoted inform ation, som e of which ended up being the catalyst for dangerous and abusive conflicts on our
cam pus. In addition, the idea of AI being protected in order to allow such apps (and the people behind them ) to scrape people's
copyrighted work is abhorrent. Artists and writers m ust be allowed control of their own work which is often their livelihood and m eans of
literal survival. They do not deserve to have creative work stolen and corrupted, and for a few wealthy strangers to profit from  it instead.
No such technology needs protection or support by the governm ent of the United States.
