General Comment
By allowing AI com panies to continue to go unchecked, whether it be with regard to copyright issues or not, people will be able to
continue m aking AI generated videos of Elon Musk sucking and kissing all over Trum p's feet. That's not even the upper lim it of what
they'll use it for, and that should scare you.
Allowing AI com panies, OpenAI included, to train their m odels on the copyrighted work of others is straight up copyright infringem ent. I
don't care how you try to slice it. They should be held liable for this like any person.
On top of this serious issue, the am ount of energy it takes to power all of these generative AI databases is a huge hit to the environm ent
and is only going to further destroy our planet and clim ates. The hum an race is on a fast track for extinction if we aren't careful.
