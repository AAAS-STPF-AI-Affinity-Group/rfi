General Comment
This is genuinely, in m y honest opinion, a very bad thing for the Am erican Governm ent to focus on.
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
I ask this genuinely: Who needs it?
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
AI is over-hyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
Everything nowadays has som e form  of AI built into it, when we, the people, do not need it.
Not to m ention, AI is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), with false prom ises to fool the
public and huge legal problem s by enabling them .
Nvidiaâ€™s $600B m arket cap drop was not an accident, AI is a speculative bubble waiting to pop.
