General Comment
Hello and thank you for your tim e to consider all public com m ents regarding AI. 
I am  writing to im plore you to reconsider utilizing any and all AI services/program s. I have spent the past two years watching friends and
love ones suffer at the hands of this technology as their art is being used to feed these program s to churn out half-hearted im ages that their
creator likes to call "art.". I have seen first-hand the inherent laziness that com es with utilizing this type of technology, from  students in a
university setting to m y veterinary colleagues who cannot take two m inutes to type up their client com m unications that are part of a legal
docum ent (m edical record). Even with all of this, this technology is having a horrific im pact on our environm ent. The am ount of water that
is needed to run these program s and to keep their servers running is astronom ically high and in a tim e where the effects of clim ate change
are being felt all across our wonderful nation, we cannot afford to let these program s run ram pant. 
Until we can better figure out how to program  these technologies to com e up with content and inform ation without im pingem ent on
copyrights of the artists in our nation AND without im pacting our environm ent, we should not be utilizing these technologies at all. This
technology will not m ake anything m ore efficient and will steal the jobs of thousands of Am ericans. It would be large stain on our country
as a whole and will im pact everyone. 
Thank you for your tim e.
