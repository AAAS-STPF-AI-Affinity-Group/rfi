General Comment
AI is overhyped and is not that im pressive. There is no reason that any AI com pany should be allowed to steal inform ation from  everyone
in order to try and m ake a m odel. These m odel are incredibly inaccurate. They lie all the tim e. The developers have no way of stopping
m odels from  lying. They have no way to stop m odels from  giving you incorrect inform ation. Not a single AI com pany is profitable. Apple
cannot sell their iPhone with AI. Microsoft cannot get people to buy their OS with AI. OpenAI is losing subscriptions. Anthropic has a
tiny user base. Meta already used copyright data in their m odels (as directed by Zuckerberg) and their m odels are terrible. 
People that create (artists, m usicians, writers, etc.) deserved to be paid for their work. Letting AI com panies steal from  them  without
paying them  is unfair to the creators. This is especially the case when it would be unprofitable com panies with technology that no one
wants.
