General Comment
Hello,
I strongly disagree with this RFI, as it is in harm  to the legal protections of creatives as well as the overall copyright system . By allowing
generative AI com panies such as OpenAI and Google to train on protected m aterial, it would actively underm ine the right of ownership
and consenting peoples. Those who do not want their content to be used for AI training, including those under legal copyright, should
m aintain their protections and right to deny such corporations from  enacting further usage. If they no longer have those protections, then
that would be allowing generative AI com panies to effectively steal any m aterial desired for their own usage. This RFI does not stand for
the rights of people, and should not be pursued.
