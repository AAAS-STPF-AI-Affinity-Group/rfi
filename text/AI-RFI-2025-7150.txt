General Comment
Am erica hasn’t been a leader in AI in its entirety. AI in its current iteration is a subpar answer to whatever needs the elite is m aking up.
We do not need to be first in AI because it’s not som ething that should be used. Instead of using resources to sustain generative AI, how
about we put that effort towards, I don’t know, literally anything else?
