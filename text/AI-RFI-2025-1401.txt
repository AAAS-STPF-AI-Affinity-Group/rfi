RE: National Science Foundation’s Development of an  AI Action Plan  
Dear Ms. Plimpton:  
On behalf of the more than 3 million members of the National Education Association (NEA), we 
submit the following response to the National Science Foundation’s request for information on the 
development of an artificial intelligence (AI) action plan. As AI  continues to reshape aspects of 
society, we highly encourage the NSF to consider the increasing impact that AI will play in the 
education sector and on educators and students across the country.  
In accordance with the notice, “This document is approved f or public dissemination. The document 
contains no business -proprietary or confidential information. Document contents may be reused by 
the government in developing the AI Action Plan and associated documents without attribution.”  
At the core of our recomme ndations, we believe students and educators remain at the center of 
education. The NEA envisions AI -enhanced technologies as an aid to public educators and education, 
not as a replacement for meaningful and necessary human connection. The use of AI should not 
displace of impair the connection between students and educators, a connection that is essential to 
fostering academic success, critical thinking, interpersonal and social skills, emotional well -being, 
creativity, and the ability to fully participate i n society.  
Educator Involvement in AI Development & Implementation  
Educators are on the front line of integrating AI into classrooms, but they are often excluded from 
decision -making processes related to AI tool development. Educator i nvolvement is critic al to 
ensuring  that AI is implemented in ways that are effective, accurate, and appropriate for learners at 
all levels. We urge  the NSF to support efforts to collaborate between AI developers, educators, 
policymakers, and researchers to ensure that AI tool s align with pedagogical best practices and serve 
the real needs of students and educators. Additionally, funding opportunities should be made 
available for initiatives that actively involve educators in education -focused AI research and 
development.

Fairn ess and Accessibility in AI Integration  
AI tools in education must be developed and deployed in ways that ensure fairness and accessibility 
for all students, regardless of socioeconomic background, race, disability, or zip code. Many 
underserved communitie s continue to face barriers to accessing quality education, including limited 
access to technological resources. It is important that education systems are able to not only provide 
AI tools but also guarantee the technical support, devices, and internet in frastructure necessary to 
reliably access and use AI in both the classroom and at home. The NSF should prioritize research and 
funding for AI applications that reduce disparities in access to high -quality educational resources, 
facilitate differentiated in struction, and provide personalized learning experiences. Additionally, AI 
systems should be rigorously evaluated to ensure they do not reinforce existing biases.  
Student & Educator Data Privacy Protections  
AI systems in education must be guided by strong ethical principles, including transparency, 
accountability, and student and educator data privacy. As the use of AI tools for learning and 
assessment has grown exponentially, the risk of data misuse and abuse has also increased. AI systems 
should be design ed with robust encryption, minimal data collection, and clear protocols for data 
storage. Educators, students, and their families must have full transparency around what data is 
collected, how it is used, and who has access to it. There must be clear guide lines in place to ensure 
compliance with existing privacy laws such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
(FERPA) and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The NEA recommends that 
the NSF promote policies that safeguard student a nd educator data from exploitation or unauthorized 
access. AI systems should be designed to allow for human oversight. Additionally, schools and 
educators should be provided with guidelines on responsible AI usage, ensuring that personal 
information remain s protected at all times.  
Evidence -Based AI Technology  
AI should only be adopted once there is data supporting a tool’s appropriateness and efficacy with 
potential users, and, for instruction -focused AI, its alignment with high -quality teaching and learnin g 
standards and practices. AI tools should be tested in real -world educational settings to evaluate their 
effectiveness, ensure they enhance learning outcomes, and prevent unintended negative 
consequences. Various types of tools – including but not limited  to adaptive learning platforms, 
intelligent tutoring systems, AI -powered writing assistants, language learning tools, classroom 
management tools – are regularly used in classrooms across the country. It’s critical that evidence 
supporting specific tools c omes from either research conducted and reviewed by independent 
researchers or from industry -sponsored research that adheres to the same standards of methodology 
and peer review as independent research. Where such research is unavailable, AI should be adop ted 
on a pilot or trial basis if the evidence is being collected and analyzed in a timely manner, with an 
agreement in place to cease the use of the technology if the research does not show the intended 
benefits toward educational goals. The NSF should pri oritize funding for studies that assess AI’s 
impact on student achievement, equity, and educator workload.  
AI Literacy & Ongoing Professional Development for Students & Educators  
Effective, safe, and equitable use of AI technology in education requires that students and educators 
become fully AI literate and develop a greater sense of agency with this technology. AI literacy must 


be part of every student’s basic education and every  educator’s professional preparation and 
development. Curricular changes should be made to incorporate AI literacy across all subject areas 
and educational levels so that all students understand the benefits, risks, and effective uses of these 
tools. Educa tors must also be afforded high -quality, multifaceted, ongoing professional learning 
opportunities that help increase their AI literacy and understand what, how, and why specific AI is 
being used in their educational settings.  
The proliferation of deep  fake technology poses significant risks, especially for students, who may be 
more vulnerable to misinformation, manipulation, and exploitation. These fabricated media can 
create harmful content that damages reputations, invades privacy, and poses serious ris ks to the 
mental health and safety of young people. Additionally, the rise of AI companion technology raises 
concerns about privacy and the potential for artificial interactions to exploit users’ emotional 
vulnerabilities or sensitive data.  
The NSF should fund professional development programs that help educators understand AI 
technologies, their potential, and their limitations. These trainings should cover how AI can be used 
to support personalized learning, how to identify and mitigate biases in AI, and how to utilize AI to 
reduce administrative burdens. Additionally, AI literacy should be incorporated into educator 
preparation programs to ensure aspiring educators enter the profession with a strong understand of AI 
technology.  The NSF AI action plan shou ld also address the risks of deep  fake and companion 
technologies by promoting safeguards, transparency, and digital literacy initiatives to protect both 
students and educators.  
Energy Consumption & Environmental Impact of AI  
The rapid advancement of AI te chnologies comes with significant energy consumption, raising 
concerns about sustainability and the impact on the environment. Although these technologies 
operate in virtual spaces, AI and the cloud are only going to continue to consume increasing amounts 
of energy and require larger quantities of natural resources, which will likely increase greenhouse gas 
emissions. As AI becomes more integrated into education and society, it is imperative to develop 
sustainable AI solutions that prioritize environmental responsibility. The NSF should invest in 
research focused on energy -efficient AI models. Additionally, partnerships between AI researchers 
and environmental scientists should be encouraged to identify strategies that make AI development 
more sustainable. E ducational institutions should be provided with best practices for minimizing their 
carbon footprint while leveraging the benefits of AI tools.  
AI for Students with Disabilities  
Artificial intelligence -enabled systems offer many potential opportunities for  disability inclusion and 
independence, revolutionizing assistive technologies. AI tools can empower individuals with 
disabilities to meet personal needs, enhance personal mobility, and support communication through 
eye-tracking and voice -recognition softw are, among other benefits. The adaptive nature of AI 
provides a pathway to address specific individual needs, significantly expanding possibilities for 
reasonable accommodations for both students and educators.  It is critical that AI resources are 
develope d for students with diverse learning styles. Actively involving people with disabilities in the 
development, design, and maintenance of AI systems ensures technology that is not only compliant 
with accessibility standards but also genuinely user -centric, c onsidering the unique challenges and 


needs of individuals with disabilities. The NSF should fund research to understand how AI is being 
developed and utilized in practice for students with disabilities.  
The NEA respectfully submits the above comments for c onsideration in response to this request for 
information regarding the NSF’s development of an AI action plan. We look forward to collaborating 
with the NSF in the future in its work around AI. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Justin 
Thompson at  should you have any questions.
