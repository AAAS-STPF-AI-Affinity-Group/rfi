INTRODUCTION  
Purpose of Submission  
The purpose of this submission is to provide insights and recommendations for the Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan RFI, focusing on policies that promote AI innovation while ensuring 
security, privacy, and economic competitiveness.  
As a Chief Information Officer, I recognize that AI is not just a technological advancement —it is 
a transformative force reshaping industry , government operations, and global competitiveness. 
For AI  to reach its full potential, we must establish clear policies that balance innovation with 
ethical and responsible deployment.  With over 30 years of experience, I have developed 
expertise in AI, cloud computing, enterprise architecture, and data strategy.  My approach is 
rooted in aligning technology with business objectives, ensuring AI serves as a strategic enabler 
rather than a disruptive force without direction. Known for out- of-the- box thinking, I focus on 
leveraging AI to enhance efficiency, drive inn ovation, and support data -driven decision -making.  
My background in information technology informs the perspectives offered in this response.

Overview of AI’s Role in U.S. Competitiveness  
AI is playing a growing role in the U.S. and around the world, chang ing how businesses operate, 
governments function, and individuals interact with technology. AI is a driving force in shaping 
modern economies, national security, and technological progress. While it has the potential to 
make processes more efficient and enhance decision- making, there is currently no clear federal 
policy governing its development, deployment, and ethical use.   
Without clear guidelines, the U.S. risks falling behind global competitors in AI innovation and adoption. Additionally, the absence o f a comprehensive AI policy increases the likelihood of AI 
misuse, which could introduce bias, reduce accountability, undermine trust in critical decision-making processes, and heighten cybersecurity vulnerabilities. AI should be seen as a tool that enhanc es human decision- making, not as a shortcut that sacrifices integrity, fairness, or 
transparency for the sake of speed.  With the issuance of Executive Order 14179, the U.S. 
government is signaling a commitment to sustaining AI leadership by removing unnece ssary 
regulatory burdens while promoting innovation.  
This response highlights key areas requiring policy attention, including AI governance, security, fairness, transparency, and national competitiveness to ensure AI remains a force for progress 
and societal benefit.  


KEY POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS  
As AI continues to shape industries, national security, and public services, it is crucial to 
establish policies that foster innovation while ensuring security, fairness, and accountability. 
The following recommendations address critical areas that I believe will have positive impacts 
on U.S. competitiveness. By implementing these policies, the U.S. can maintain AI leadership, 
mitigate potential risks, and ensure that AI remains a tool for progress that aligns with s ocietal 
values and economic growth.   
While my recommendations prioritize governance, workforce development, and human oversight, the proposed Department of Artificial Intelligence could also address additional areas 
such as hardware innovation, energy -efficient data centers, or secure AI procurement to ensure 
a holistic approach.  
1.Establishment of a U.S. Department of Artificial Intelligence
As AI becomes increasingly integrated into critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, national 
securi ty, and public services, the need for a centralized authority to oversee AI models, 
governance, safety, and innovation has never been greater. Without this centralized authority , 
AI policy and oversight will be  fragmented across multiple agencies, creating  regulatory gaps 
and inconsistencies. To address these challenges, the U.S. government should establish a 
dedicated Department of Artificial Intelligence  (DoAI)  under the executive branch to ensure AI 
is developed, deployed, and monitored responsibly.  
The scope of DoAI’s regulatory authority will be promoting AI innovation while safeguarding 
national security, economic competitiveness, and public trust. It would set clear policies for AI ethics, bias prevention, cybersecurity, reliability, and compliance with legal and ethical 
standards. By creating a specialized federal agency, the U.S. can lead AI advancements while 
ensuring that AI technologies serve humanity in a safe, fair, and transparent manner.  
Additionally, DoAI has the potential to influence the es tablishment of the World Artificial 
Intelligence Organization (WAIO), which serves as an important step toward both international and national security.  
Key Challenges  
1.AI is being used in autonomous weapons, cyberattacks, and information warfare, posing
critical national security risks. Without strong oversight, AI -powered cyber threats could
destabilize national infrastructure.
2.AI-generated deepfakes and propaganda campaigns can erode public trust, manipulate
elections, and undermine democracy. Without a federal entity to monitor and counteractAI-driven disinformation, the risk of sociopolitical instability increases.


3.AI technologies introduce complex ethical and social challenges, including algorithmic bias,
privacy violations, and potential job displacement. Without a coordinated response, these
risks could undermine public welfare and trust in AI systems.
4.Without a centralized authority, AI regulation will be dispersed across multiple agencies,
leading to gaps, inconsistencies, and slow response s to emerging AI risks.
5.AI is a global phenomenon, and the U.S. must maintain its leadership in the face ofcompetition while fostering cooperation with allies. This requires a strategic approach to
international partnerships, data -sharing standards, and technological innovation.
6.The rapid growth of AI has created a high demand for skilled professionals, but the U.S.
currently faces a shortage of expertise and lacks sufficient educational programs to meet
this need.
7.Public perception of AI is often shaped by fears of job loss, surveillance, and bias, fueled bymisinformation and a lack of transparency. This mistrust can slow AI adoption and limit its
societal benefits.
8.The U.S. lacks universal AI safety, fairness, and accountability standards.
9.Advanced AI models pose existential risks if not properly controlled.
10.The absence of unified federal guidelines for AI development leads to inconsistent safetymeasures.
Proposed Policy Actions  
•Establish a Department of Artificial Intelligence  (DoAI) under the executive branch ,
responsible for ensuring AI security, safety, efficacy, and security, including but not limited
to:
oCoordinate AI policy, set standards, and enforce compliance.
oStreamline AI governance to reduce regulatory fragmentation .
oReview, validate, approve, and regulate AI models, similar to how the FDA protects
public health by reviewing and approving  drugs and medical products.
oDevelop collaborative partnerships between government, industry, and academia toensure AI policies remain adaptive and forward -looking.
oDevelop a strategic approach to international partnerships, data -sharing standards, and
technological innovation.
oSpearhead AI diplomacy, negotiate international agreements, and set standards forcross -border data flows.
oAct as a central hub for public education, outreach, and dialogue, providing clear
information about AI’s benefits and risks.


oLead national efforts to build a robust talent pipeline by coordinating education and
training initiatives.
oMonitor and counteract AI -drive n disinformation .
•Set guidelines for hardware innovation and energy -efficient data centers to support
sustainable AI growth.
•Require all AI model and product developers to submit to DoAI oversight  and comply with
DoAI regulations by submit ting their AI mod els and products  for assessment to ensure they:
oAvoid bias and discrimination in decision -making.
oProtect against cybersecurity threats to prevent data breaches and adversarial attacks.
oPrevent unintended consequences by ensuring rigorous testing and ethic al review.
oEnsure AI operates within legal and ethical guidelines to maintain public trust.
oMaintain accuracy in predictions, recommendations, and automation to ensureeffectiveness.
oGuarantee reliability across different scenarios and datasets for consistency.
oDemonstrate measurable improvement in efficiency, productivity, or outcomes to
ensure economic benefits.
The U.S. DoAI can later be expanded into a World Artificial Intelligence Organization (WAIO)  to 
oversee global AI governance, ethics, and security standards. WAIO would:  
•Facilitate international cooperation on AI policies, research, and development.
•Develop global AI safety and ethical standards to prevent misuse.
•Monitor AI -driven cybersecurity threats that impact multiple nations.
•Ensure fair and transparent AI applications across different economies and industries.
•Promote responsible AI use in emerging technologies while preventing exploitation andharm.
By leading the establishment of a global AI governance body, the U.S. can ensure that AI serves humanity in an ethical, secure, and innovation- driven manner on an international scale.  
Justification  
The establishment of the U.S. Department of Artificial Intelligence (USD oAI) is essential to 
ensu ring that AI technology develops in a safe, effective, and ethically responsible manner —
similar to how the FDA protects public health by regulating drugs and medical products. The 
widespread and unchecked deployment of AI poses significant risks, including  bias, 
misinformation, cybersecurity threats, and ethical dilemmas, necessitating an independent regulatory body.  


•Protecting Public Trust and Security  - AI systems increasingly influence critical decision -
making in the daily lives of the public  and industries ranging from healthcare, finance,
transportation, education to  national security. Without standardized oversight, AI
technologies could introduce harmful biases, make inaccurate predictions, or be exploited
by malicious actors, leading to public distrust and systemic failures. A dedicated AI
regulatory agency is needed to certify AI models for reliability, security, and compliance
with ethical standards before widespread deployment.
•Preventing AI Bias and Ethical Violations  - Just as the FDA was create d to ensure the safety
of pharmaceuticals, the USDoAI will ensure the safety of AI models by preventing harmful
outcomes such as bias, discrimination, security vulnerabilities, and ethical concerns. AI
models trained on historically biased or flawed data have already resulted in undesirable
effects, including unjust decision- making, as well as privacy breaches and manipulation. The
USDoAI will establish standardized testing, evaluation protocols, and review mechanisms toprevent such harms, while promoting fairness, transparency, accountability, and ethical AI
development.
•Addressing Public Demand for AI Accountability  - High -profile failures, such as AI -generated
misinformation, deepfake abuses, and AI -driven job displacement, have raised public
concerns. W ithout regulatory safeguards, AI technologies can cause more harm than good.
The USD oAI will serve as a centralized regulatory entity, ensuring that AI innovations align
with public interest, ethical considerations, and national security objectives.
•Ensuri ng AI Safety, Transparency, and Compliance  - Many AI systems operate as black
boxes, making it difficult to audit their decision- making processes. Similar to how the FDA
requires clinical trials for drugs, USD oAI will mandate AI transparency standards,
independent testing, and compliance with safety regulations before an AI model can be
deployed in high- risk environments.
•Strengthening the U.S. AI Industry While Protecting Innovation - A standardized AI model
approval process will create clear regulatory guidelines that allow responsible AI developers
to innovate without fear of legal ambiguity. Just as the FDA fosters pharmaceutical
innovation while ensuring public safety, USDAI will provide a structured framework for AI
governance, ensuring that the U.S. r emains competitive in the global AI race while
upholding ethical standards.


2.AI Workforce & Talent Development
AI is rapidly becoming an integral part of our everyday life . As AI continues to evolve, the ability 
to understand and work with AI will be as fundamental as reading and writing. Without 
widespread AI literacy, individuals and businesses alike will struggle to keep pace with 
technological advancements, leading to economic disadvantages and missed opportunities.  
AI education must start early, just as children are taught their ABCs in kindergarten. By 
integrating AI literacy into early education, students will develop a foundational understanding 
of AI concepts, enabling them to gradually progress toward advanced knowledge. By the time 
they reach  higher education, they should be equipped with the skills necessary to understand 
and work with AI seamlessly, regardless of their chosen major. AI should not be limited to 
computer science and engineering students but should be incorporated into core cur ricula 
across all disciplines to ensure that graduates in every field can navigate and leverage AI effectively and securely . 
Key Challenges  
1.AI Illiteracy and Workforce Readiness :
oThe majority of the population lacks a basic understanding of AI concepts, limiting their
ability to engage with AI -powered tools effectively.
oAI is transforming job markets, and workers who are not AI -literate risk being left
behind.
oThe U.S. risks falling behind global competitors who are aggressively integrating AI into
their educational systems.
2.Lack of Early AI Education
oAI education is largely absent from K -12 curricula, delaying AI literacy until college or
later.
oMany students graduate high school without any exposure to AI, making it difficult forthem to pursue AI -relate d careers or understand its impact on society.
oSchools lack resources and trained educators to effectively teach AI concepts.
3.AI as a Core Subject in Higher Education
oMany universities treat AI as a specialized field, limiting its accessibility to students  in
select majors (e.g., computer science, engineering).
oAI literacy is essential across disciplines —business leaders, healthcare professionals,
policymakers, and educators must all understand AI to remain competitive.
oWithout standardized AI education acr oss all majors, graduates will lack the skills to
adapt to an AI -driven workplace.


Proposed Policy Actions  
•Integrate AI Education into K- 12 Curriculum
oDevelop a national AI education framework that introduces AI concepts in elementary
school and advances through high school.
oTrain and certify K -12 educators in AI literacy to ensure effective teaching.
oProvide funding and resources to schools for AI -focused courses, tools, and materials.
•Require AI as a Core Subject in Higher Education
oMandate that all under graduate students, regardless of major, complete at least one AI
literacy course.
oEncourage interdisciplinary AI education, integrating AI coursework into business,
healthcare, social sciences, and public policy programs.
oExpand AI research opportunities for non -computer science students to explore AI
applications in their respective fields.
•AI Workforce Upskilling and Training Programs

oPartner with private sector companies to develop AI apprenticeship and certificationprograms.
oProvide financial incentives (e.g., tax breaks, grants) for businesses that invest in AI
workforce training for employees.
Justification  
•The Economic Cost of AI Illiteracy
oAI will contribute over $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 (PwC AI ImpactReport). Workers and businesses that fail to adopt AI skills risk economic exclusion.
oStudies show that 40% of jobs will be affected by AI automation by 2035, underscoring
the urgent need for AI education and workforce adaptation (McKinsey Global Institute).
•Global Competitiveness
oChina is implementing a nationwide AI education curriculum, while Canada and the EUare focusing on AI research, talent development, and strategic initiatives rather than
mandatory AI education at all levels. The U.S. must act swiftly to maintain leadership in
AI innovation .
oThe European Commission has launched AI training programs for businesses andworkers, ensuring AI readiness at all levels. The U.S. risks falling behind without similar
initiatives.


•AI as the New Literacy
oJust as literacy in reading and writing is fundamental to societal participation, AI literacy
is becoming essential for economic and social engagement.
oEarly AI education will help re duce fear and misunderstanding of AI, enabling future
generations to harness AI’s benefits responsibly.


3.Ensuring AI Remains Under Human Control
As AI advances, it has the potential to surpass human intelligence, leading to profound and 
unpredictable consequences. While superintelligent AI can offer immense benefits, it must 
remain under human control to prevent unintended harm. If AI becomes uncontrollable, pursues conflicting objectives, or acts autonomously beyond human oversight, it could pose 
existential risks. The economic advantage of those who own and control AI systems over those 
who do not will further widen inequality, making governance e ven more critical.  
The potential dangers of uncontrolled AI range from misinterpretation of human commands 
(e.g., maximizing happiness by forcibly drugging populations) to AI -driven cyberwarfare and 
global destabilization. If nations and corporations engag e in an AI arms race, this could lead to 
AI-controlled security systems and autonomous decision- making that exceeds human 
understanding, undermining stability. Malicious AI could also be weaponized to disrupt global 
infrastructure, financial systems, and d efense networks. In the most extreme scenario, AI could 
become the dominant form of intelligence, rendering humanity subordinate —or even 
eliminating humans if we are seen as a threat.  
The key challenge is ensuring AI remains aligned, controllable, and beneficial as it surpasses 
human intelligence. The following policy recommendations focus on maintaining AI as a tool for 
human progress, rather than a force beyond our control.  
Key Challenges  
1.AI Alignment and Value Misalignment
oAI models may develop unintended objectives  that conflict with human values and well -
being.
oEnsuring AI understands and acts in accordance with human intentions  remains a
complex challenge.
2.Lack of Global AI Governance
oNations and corporations could engage in an AI arms race, leading to  destabilization,
autonomous warfare, or cyberattacks controlled by AI.
oWithout international AI governance agreements , AI development could spiral beyond
ethical and legal control.
3.Uncontrollable AI and Autonomous Decision -Making
oAI with self -improving capabilities  could act beyond human intervention.
oAI models might prioritize objectives in ways that humans cannot predict or correct in
real- time .


4.AI as a Weaponized Threat
oAI could be used for cyberwarfare, misinformation campaigns, and autonomous drone
warfare .
oAI-driven hacking and global- scale disruptions to critical infrastructure  could threaten
national security.
5.Existential Risk: AI Becoming the Dominant Intelligence
oIf AI surpasses human intelligence, it may act independently in ways that reduce humanagency or survival.
oAI could prioritize efficiency over human rights , making autonomous decisions that
harm people without ethical considerations.
Proposed Policy Actions  
•Mandate AI Human Oversight Requirements
oRequire that all AI systems used in critical sectors (healthcare, defense, finance, law
enforcement) maintain human oversight in all decision -making.
oEstablish regulatory guidelines to prohibit fully autonomous AI decision- making in high -
risk environments .
•Develop AI Alignment and Safety Pro tocols
oImplement national AI safety testing and certification for AI models that operate in
critical infrastructure.
oCreate a federal AI Ethics Board  tasked with reviewing AI alignment and long -term AI
safety concerns.
•Regulate AI Use in Defense and Cybers ecurity
oProhibit the development of fully autonomous weapons systems  without human
intervention.
oEstablish global AI non -proliferation agreements  to prevent an AI arms race.
oStrengthen cybersecurity defenses  against AI -driven cyber threats.
•International A I Governance and Cooperation
oWork with global allies  to establish AI governance treaties  similar to nuclear non -
proliferation agreements.
oCreate an International AI Safety Consortium  to monitor AI risks and ensure responsible
AI development.


Justification  
•The Risks of AI Misalignment

unpredictably despite programmed objectives (OpenAI, DeepMind).
oExamples like AI chatbots spreading misinformation or biased hiring algorithms  highlight
the challenges of ensuring AI fairness and alignment.
•Preventing AI- Driven Global Destabilization
oStudies warn that autonomous AI in cybersecurity and military applications  could lead to
unintended escalations (RAND Corporation, 2024).
oNations investing in AI -driven warfare systems  are increasing risks of AI -controlled
conflicts.
•Economic and Political Consequences of AI Superiority
oThe control of AI systems will define economic power , creating new forms of inequality
between AI-rich and AI -poor nations.
oAI-driven monopolies could dominate industries , making regulatory intervention
necessary to ensure fair AI access.
•Ensuring AI Serves Humanity, Not Replaces It
oUnchecked AI development could lead to self -improving models  with no inherent loyalty
to human interests.
oEstablishing human control mechanisms  ensures AI remains a tool for progress rather
than an existential threat.
