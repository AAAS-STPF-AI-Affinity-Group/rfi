General Comment
AI tools largely exist to feed off of other creations, credit should be going to those borrowing sources and creations. Instead AI stands to
get around copyright by not credited those involved, not linking to the resources it has fed off of, and refusing to upon question.
These AI tools can also be used to generate the offending content. And for security there just isn't the m anpower. You can have it but not
secured. The US Adm inistration currently shows strong interest in less and less people being involved at the m om ent too.
I think AI does show how valuable the inform ation age can be for learning and perform ing new skills and this effort should instead be used
for the education of various skills. There's no value in m y work as a skill unless neurons are firing in m y brain as I'm  doing it, this is how we
learn. There's value in that.
But we've seen AI im plem entation in sites like Google or Twitter do ultim ately nothing for the platform . For Google, SEO is m essed up
and takes ages to load now. For Twitter, Grok was just sorta tacked on and it feels like nothing else has happened to platform .
Nobody I know is seriously using grok, and m ost AI im plem entation I see from  m utuals is solely for m em es are m aking fun of it.
The introduction of bad AI posters from  som e com panies shows the lack of effort they put into their business. This is not som ething we
should be em bracing.
