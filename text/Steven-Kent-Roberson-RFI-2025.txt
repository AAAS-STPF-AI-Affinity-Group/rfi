pg. 1 Request  for Information  on the Development  of an Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  
National  Science  Foundation:  Document  Citation  90 FR 9088 
Author:  
Steven Kent Roberson based on 36 years of working in High Tech and 
a high  interest  in the direction  of Artiﬁcial  Intelligence  in today’s  world.  
Overview:  
How  to advance  the development  of AI as a tool to help  humans -help - 
humans  while  preventing the  proliferation of  weaponized AI  available 
to any and all bad actors.  
Objective:  
Allow  and encourage  advancement  of AI related  to vision  (emotions  & 
facial recognition -FRT) & Analytics.  
•Continue building use cases with limited or no guardrails
within all industries to include but not limited to: health
care,  utilities,  automotive,  communications,  oil & Gas,  green
energy, retail, travel & transportation, ﬁnancial services,
consumer  goods,  life sciences,  on-line services,  social  media,
education & research and high -tech Industrial
manufacturing.


pg. 2 •Improve  facial  recognition  to a level  that it can be accurately
used  by Law Enforcement  in identifying not  only Caucasians
but also people of color.
•Determine  appropriate  level  of guardrails  related  to the use
of AI for Military & Defense.
Concerns:  
Weaponization  
Unchecked,  AI with  Agency  in the hands  of bad actors  would  potentially 
negate the US’s strong position to keep peace within our own borders 
and worldwide.  
Example:  
•Weaponized  Drones  with  or without  Agency  would  be a
relatively inexpensive weapon that could be:
•Purchased  by any bad actor  in the 1s or 1000s
•Easy  to conceal  and transport  in bulk
•Released  as an individual  unit or as a swarm
•Deployed  with  limited  or no warning  to law enforcement
•Targeted  to individuals  or large  groups  using  FRT including
but not limited to:
oSpeciﬁc  individuals
oRacial  Groups
oGroups  deﬁned  by location
With Agency, such weapons could:  
•Be released  and forgotten  until  goal  was reached
•Have  ability  to return  home  to recharge  and return  to


pg. 3 mission  
•Determine  new  targets  based  on self-learning
oTake  out targets  not determined  by humans
•Refuse  to have  mission  cancelled
General  concerns  of AI without  Agency  but at a Cognitive  level  
•Chatbots  being  abused  in education  (at low levels  now  but
could increase)
•Chatbots  using  sycophancy  to replace  facts  with  favored
answers or advise
•Chatbots  masquerading  as providing  professional  advice
rather than advice based on entertainment.
•Chatbots  providing  harmful  information  not based  on facts.
•The abuse  of AI Deepfake  images  for any purpose  other  than
innocent entertainment including but not limited to:
political, sexual, pedophilia, celebrity scams, endorsement
scams, etc.
General  concerns  of AI with  Agency  
AI in any industry  not requiring  humans  to make  decisions  for AI 
to: 
•Keep  from  being  turned  oﬀ
•Replicate  itself
•Acquire  more  resources


pg. 4 Have  AI Safety  as a requirement  for development  to: 
•Keep  from  moving  too quickly  based  on political,
•Keep  AI from  becoming  more  than  just a tool for humanscommercial and military inﬂuencesto help  humans  (suﬃcient  guardrails).
How  to determine  and enforce  a “Moral  Conscience”  for AI 
•Can this even  be regulated?
•How  does  this change  based  on race,  religion,  status,  etc…?
oHow  is the Trolley  Dilemma  addressed  with  AI?
▪How  can the best -case  scenario  be determined?
Proposed  Solution:  
Based  on National  advancement  and Security  interests,  ﬁnd a way to: 
•Limit  the ability  of worldwide  private,  public  and governmental
industry to generate AI with Agency
oProvide  appropriate  guardrails  to limit  development
▪This could  be directed.  If not, may  end up as a de-facto
standard based on past and current Cold War and
Nuclear standards and proliferation.
•Encourage  responsible  development  with  AI Safety  as a key
qualiﬁer.
oKeep  from  moving  too quickly  based  on political,  commercial
and military inﬂuences
oKeep  AI from  becoming  more  than  just a tool for humans  to
help humans (suﬃcient guardrails until society is ready)


pg. 4 oCarefully  navigate  the advancements  into Self-aware  and
Sentient AI.
