General Comment
I am  deeply opposed to this rule change. “AI” m ust NOT be allowed to freely plagiarize the work of the creative people of the world!
The point of AI is to do tedious work for creative people, not the other way around. If a person can’t be bothered to write or draw it, I
won’t be bothered to read or adm ire it.
