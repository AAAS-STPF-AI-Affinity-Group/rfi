Hello -
I am compelled to respond to any sort of movement towards normalizing AI. I, as an
American, want no part in AI becoming something that has free reign over other people'sworks. It has no place in America or anywhere for that matter.As an artist, it threatens my works and a chance at a livelihood through my art. It steals frompeople. It spits out misinformation.
We deserve better. AI tricks and steals. We must do away with it and protect people's work.Thank you.- Janelle Krzykowski
