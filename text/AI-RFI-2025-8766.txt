General Comment
A basic skim  on this would suggest that all form s of m edia would no longer be profitable or even really accessible to create for anybody
that does not have access to things like Google or OpenAI. To som ebody who works very hard to create original content and works,
com pletely robbing m yself and other people of such works belonging to m yself and m yself alone, especially now that I've been seriously
developing a plan for developing m y work into an official show and com ic series, and in a group of friends with sim ilar situations, this is
straight up just ruining job opportunities. There's no other real way to put it. This is strongly discouraging and a threat to an entire career
field.
