General  Comment  
IQ Throttles:  A Standard  for Contro  ling AI Inte ligence  
AI systems must include  IQ throttles that limit the  sophistication  of perceivable  inte ligence.  Individual  citizens should  have the ability  to 
increase  or decrease  the the IQ of AI systems they  encounter  within  their local environment,  similar  to a dimmer  switch  for lighting.  This 
local control  ensures  AI remains  a tool that serves  human  needs  at the local level but limits  the widespread  adoption  and elimination  of 
human  jobs. 
The AI Trust Council  (TheAITC.com) 
Implementation  Strategy  
A blockchain  based  voting  mechanism  wil be established,  integrating  social  networking,  insurance,  and finance.  A robust  KYC process 
tied to a cryptocurrency  account  and financial  verification  wil eliminate  fake bot accounts,  ensuring  only real individuals  participate  in 
governance.  
Through  this blockchain  platform,  users wi l vote on  specific AI use cases.  Every  aspect of  AI deployment can  be debated and 
recommended,  creating  a transparent and  democratic  system.  The resulting  data pool wil serve as a reference  for lawmakers,  enabling  
themto craft AI regulations that genuinely  reflect public opinion  and protect societal  interests.  
Ensuring  Constitutional  Liberties  in AI 
AI models must be built on  a foundation  that upholds constitutional  civil liberties.  The protection  of individual  freedoms such  as freedom  of 
speech,  religion,  assembly,  and the press  must be a core principle in  the development  of high IQ AI systems.  This ensures  that AI 
enhances  human  rights  rather  than suppressing  them. 
By implementing  these controls,  we can create a future where  AI remains  aligned  with human  values,  while safeguarding  democracy  and 
personal  freedom.

Private  Equity  Through  Accredited  lnvestors1 
"Accredited  investor"  is a term used by the Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  under Regulation  D to refer to investors  who are finan- 
cially sophisticated  and have a reduced need for  the protection  provided  by certain  government  filings.  In order  for an individual  to qualify as 
an accredited  investor, he  or she must accomplish  at least one  of the following: (1)  Earn an  individual  income  of more than  $200,000 per year, 
or a joint income  of $300,000,  in each of the last  two years and  expect  to maintain  the same level of income;  (2) Have  a net worth exceeding  
$1,000,000,  either  individually  or jointly with  a spouse; (3)  Be a general  partner,  executive  officer, director  or a related  combination  thereof  for 
the issuer  of a security being  offered.  
Private  equity is money invested  in firms which have not 'gone public'  and therefore  are not  listed on any  stock exchange  such as  "Over the 
Counter",  "Pink Slips",  NASDAQ  or the NYSE.  Private  equity is illiquid because  sellers  of private  stocks  (called  private  securities)  must first locate 
willing  buyers.  Investors  in private  equity  are generally compensated  when:  (1) the firm goes public,  (2) it is sold or merges  with another  firm, or 
(3) it is recapitalized.  Before  deciding  to seek investors,  know  the type of investor  needed  and then research  the individuals  or investment  groups 
to find those  interested  in the industry or  business.  Then include their requirements  in opportunity  presentation.  In general, equity  investors 
require  a much  more detailed  business  plan than a plan designed  for debt. Depending  on several  factors,  the Securities  Exchange  Commission 
(SEC)  may require  documentation,  circulars,  disclosures,  and other forms  and documents  such as a Private  Placement  Memorandum  (PPM).  
Private  equity is  equity capital that  is not quoted on  a public  exchange.  Private  equity consists  of investors  and funds that make investments 
directly  into private  companies  or conduct  buyouts  of public  companies  that result in  a delisting  of public  equity. Capital  for private  equity is  rais- 
ed from retail and institutional  investors, and  can be used to  fund new technologies,  expand  working  capital  within an owned company,  make 
acquisitions,  or to strengthen  a balance  sheet.  The size of the  private  equity market has grown  steadily since the  1970s.  The majority  of private 
equity consists of institutional  investors  and accredited  investors  who can commit large sums of money for  long periods of time.  Private equity 
investments  often demand  long holding  periods  to allow for a turnaround  of a distressed  company  or a liquidity  event  such as an IPO or sale to a 
public  company.  Private equity  firms will  sometimes  pool funds together to  take very large public  companies private.  Many private equity firms 
conduct  what are known  as leveraged  buyouts  (LBOs),  where large  amounts  of debt are issued to  fund a large purchase.  Private  equity  firms will 
then try to improve  the financial  results  and prospects  of the  company  in the hope of reselling the  company  to another  firm or cashing  out via  an 
IPO.
