General Comment
AI com panies only exist by stealing data, including a m assive am ount of copyrighted m aterial, without getting perm ission from  copyright
holders, or paying any sort of appropriate fees or royalties. They are thieves who are breaking the law, and creating no real value or viable
product in the process. They should not be given access to any data, let alone data that is legally protected, and furtherm ore, legislation
should be introduced im m ediately to further restrict and lim it their access to data obtained and abused illegally. Regulations exist to protect
citzens and businesses from  these types of abuse, and they should applied to this industry as well. Thank you.
