General Comment
I am  deeply concerned about the im pact of AI on the future of the United States. I believe generative AI tools have failed to show any real
value in the life of ordinary Am ericans, instead consistently turning out content that is incorrect, low quality, or both. Furtherm ore,
generative AI has been proven tim e and again to m ake significant use of internet scraping tools, stealing the creations of hard-working
Am ericans for the purpose of creating sim ilar-looking, uninspired slop. Our data should not be available for the taking by any shady or
m alicious actors, and this is doubly true for our intellectual m aterial. AI needs m ore guardrails, not fewer.
