General Comment
AI serves no purpose other than to steal labor. Art IS labor, it takes tim e to do right, not to m ention the hours of practice to stay on top of
your craft. All AI does is steal the hard work of artists and regurgitate it into cheap slop. It's a waste of tim e and energy and a detrim ent to
society.
