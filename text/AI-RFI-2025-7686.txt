General Comment
As a capitalist nation, the United States is no stranger to private individuals m anifesting inventions, ideas or creations and distributing said
inventions, ideas, and creations to the free m arket under the fair exchange of currency. Copyright is there to protect the individual idea
from  unjust perversion and encourage its evolution through the inspiration by the free m arket without thoroughly erasing the existence
original invention, idea, or creation. By allowing the abolition of copyright for the unscrupulous intentions of OpenAI and other like entities,
not only do we abolish the essence of the free m arket, it eviscerates the very foundation of capitalism ; that any private individual can
controls the m eans and distribution of their own production and should not have the m eans of their production egregious stolen and
abused by predatory profit-hungry entities without com pensation, as determ ined by the infringed private entity. 
Say no to allowing OpenAI and sim ilar businesses from  training their datasets on copyrighted m aterial.
