General Comment
There is not only no need for any fort of AI dom inance, but a need for AI to be dissolved until regulations are in place to protect existing
m aterial and to assure that it can only be used in an ethical m anner. In its current state, com panies are only using AI to replace workers to
produce vastly inferior work, and leave people jobless. This should not pass.
