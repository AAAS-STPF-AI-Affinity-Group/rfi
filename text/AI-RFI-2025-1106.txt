General Comment
I want us to harness the power of AI to solve problem s - such as sourcing data from  all over the world regarding cancer treatm ent so that
cures can be found. If a doctor could input the situation of a particular patient and the AI could search all related and sim ilar cases world-
wide it could then plot the m ost likely successful course of treatm ent. 
As a photographer and writer I am  concerned about the protections that should be in place to m ake sure Intellectual Property rights are
also protected. Artists and creatives should have to Opt In. Currently, the process is set up so you have to Opt Out and the process is
either difficult and burdensom e or alm ost im possible. 
I believe we can create a balance that can accom plish both types of goals if planned carefully and used properly.
