13 chains backing frontier AI programs , including supply chain vetting,  should be established, 
similar to DOD facilities clearances but tailored for commercial entities. Industry partners should 
co-develop supply chain security standards with government agencies, leveraging their expertise 
to ensure trusted supplier networks.   
Commercial Security Clearances  
Expanding commercial security clearances is necessary to develop a vetted workforce that 
extends beyond federal employees and contractors. Federal guidelines and implementation 
support for suitability and counterintelligence vetting programs should be desi gned for staff 
working in critical industrial programs as well as FFLs. These programs, similar to security 
clearances in the national security space, but specifically geared for work outside the federal 
government and its contractors, will ensure that ind ividuals involved in AI development and 
deployment are thoroughly vetted and trusted. We recommend that federal guidelines for 
commercial security clearances and supply chain security should be finalized  in 2025, with full 
implementation across  government AI innovation partners  by 2026. This initiative can be seen as 
an extension to National Security Presidential Memorandum -33. 
Information Sharing and Threat Intelligence  
Timely information sharing on potential AI vulnerabilities and adversarial attacks is crucial for 
promoting safer and more reliable AI innovation. MITRE’s ATLAS framework plays a critical 
role in the overall AI landscape by providing a comprehensive understanding of adversarial 
threats, enabling developers to anticipate and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in AI systems. By 
offering insights into real -world attack tactics and techniques, ATLAS helps industry develop AI 
technologies  that are inherently sec ure and resilient . Fostering transparent collaboration between 
government and industry further facilitate s the exchange of threat intelligence, enhancing the 
ability to proactively address emerging security challenges.  
Counterintelligence and Adversary Monitoring  
A comprehensive approach to counterintelligence is necessary to prevent adversaries from 
exploiting AI advancements. Counterintelligence efforts should target specific risks, such as 
China’s state-sponsored intellectual property  theft, to protect U.S. innovations. Monitoring 
adversarial AI tradecraft and understanding how adversaries may use AI to gain an advantage are 
critical components of this strategy. By staying vigilant and informed about adversarial activities, 
we can prot ect AI innovations from being compromised and ensure tha t they are used to advance 
national interests.  
Threat -Informed Approach to Export Controls  
To keep AI technologies out of adversaries ’ hands, a threat -informed approach to export controls 
sharpens our edge over the current system. Unlike static lists, this leverages real -time 
intelligence and threat assessments to pinpoint risks —think AI model theft or weaponization —
while balancing natio nal security with U.S. economic strength. Controls would adapt as threats 
evolve, but with clear, predictable updates to avoid bogging down industry. Partnering with tech 
leaders, the United States  can craft lean policies that block critical tech from rivals like China 
without choking American innovation, ensuring our AI stays ahead and our economy thrives.  
Resilience and Recovery  from AI Incidents  


MITRE’s Response to the OSTP RFI on AI Action Plan  
14 A national AI incident response strategy —built with industry input —must tackle two threats: 
attacks on U.S. AI capabilities and AI -driven assaults on the nation. For attacks targeting AI 
systems, like hacks on data centers or model theft, the focus is fast  recovery—restoring integrity 
and protecting IP to keep our tech edge sharp. For AI -enabled attacks, like adversaries crashing 
infrastructure with smart malware, the priority is rapid containment and public confidence, 
shielding critical systems like power  grids. This lean, dual -track approach ensures U.S. AI stays 
resilient, drives economic strength, and outpaces rivals without bogging down industry.  
Preventing Malicious Use  
Refining policies is critical to stop AI misuse and crack down on bad actors, keeping U.S. tech 
safe and strong. Clear guidelines —built with industry input —must separate legit research from 
malicious use, like AI -generated deepfakes spreading false information, AI -powered cyber  
attacks crashing our grids, or AI stealing American tech secrets. These lean rules set tough legal 
lines, ensuring accountability and deterrence without slowing innovation. By targeting these 
threats, we protect public safety, nation al security, and our economic edge, keeping AI a force 
for U.S. leadership.  
International Collaboration  
The United States  should collaborate with allies to share threat intelligence and align supply 
chain security standards, amplifying our collective resilience. International cooperation can 
enhance America’s ability to secure AI innovation and provide a global advantage  in the 
competition with China . 
Build the American Workforce to Drive and Harness AI 
Innovation Opportunities  
As AI continues to transform industries and redefine the future of work, it is crucial to build a 
workforce  capable of driving and harnessing these innovation opportunities. By focusing on 
strategic initiatives in education and training, we can ensure that the American workforce is 
prepared to lead in the AI economy and maintain a competitive edge on the global  stage. 
Enhancing STEM Education  
The foundation of a capable AI workforce begins with enhancing  science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics  (STEM) education. The federal government can play a supportive 
role by encouraging states and private industry to integrate AI concepts into STEM curricula 
from an early age. This involves curriculum changes, teacher training, and studies on how to 
approach AI e ducation at various ages. By incorporating AI into STEM education, we can ensure 
that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills  needed to thrive in a technology -driven 
world. A skilled AI workforce will help ensure the United States  outpaces China ’s state-driven 
talent pipeline . 
AI Literacy and Skills Development  
In addition to foundational STEM education, it is important to build AI literacy and skills across 
the workforce  and general population . This involves teaching individuals how to manage, 
supervise, and interact with AI technologies, ensuring they are equipped to work and live 


MITRE’s Response to the OSTP RFI on AI Action Plan  
15 alongside AI. By promoting AI literacy, we can empower all citizens  to leverage AI tools 
effectively and enhance their productivity. Initiatives that focus on developing these skills will be 
crucial for ensuring that the workforce is ready to embrace AI technologies .  
Targeted Training and Public -Private Partnerships  
To address emerging AI skill requirements, targeted training programs must be developed 
through collaborations between government, industry, and academia. Public -private partnerships , 
including academia, can leverage the strengths of each sector to create comprehensive training 
and education programs that align with the needs of the AI economy. Industry partners could co -
design training curricula, fund apprenticeships, and commit to hiring program graduat es. These 
programs should focus on preparing workers for roles in critical AI areas, such as data science, 
machine learning, and AI system design, while also anticipating emerging fields like quantum 
AI. These training programs should include certificate and non -degree programs. By fostering 
collaboration, t he United States  can ensure that training initiatives are responsive to industry 
demands and provide workers with the skills needed to succeed in AI -related careers.  
Retraining and Upskilling Initiatives  
As AI technologies continue to evolve, retraining and upskilling initiatives will be essential for
