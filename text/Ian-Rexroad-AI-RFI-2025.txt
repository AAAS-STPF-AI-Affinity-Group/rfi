Comment regarding AI Action Plan RFI :
Generative AI technology is cool, but it's not game-changing. It's a more advanced version of
predictive text generation tools that were standard on cell phones 20 years ago. Modern AIsystems use massive amounts of energy while their confident-but-wrong hallucinations makethem unreliable and unsuited to important tasks. Much like Microsoft's Clippy, AI tools havebeen making the end-user experience more aggravating in many customer-facing contextswith no benefit.
AI tools may yet find some niches where they are overall useful and welcome but they are not
essential to national security, they are not worth the massive energy drain, and they do notdeserve to be propped up by intellectual
 property exceptions that would allow their for-profit
owners to infringe copyrighted works. (If AI technologies really do have the unboundedpotential they are promised to bring, then the owners should have little difficulty convincinginvestors to license any needed copyrighted works.)
AI companies have already profited from the theft of intellectual
 property; they should not get
special treatment any further.
