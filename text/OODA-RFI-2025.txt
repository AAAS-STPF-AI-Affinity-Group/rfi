Subject : Response to the White House RFI on the Development of an AI Action Plan  
Introduction  
As the CTO and co -founder of OODA LLC, a firm dedicated to advancing technology, 
cybersecurity, and U.S. national security, I am pleased to respond to the OSTP and NITRD RFI 
on the AI Action Plan.  
I base this recommendation on over three decades of work on issues surrounding the 
optimization of technology for business and government outcomes. It is also informed by 
research on advanced AI at our OODAloop.com site and interactions with the business a nd 
government leaders in the OODA network, who continuously collaborate on related issues.  
The administration’s AI vision, as articulated in Executive Order 14179 and the Vice President’s 
four goals for American AI, aligns with my belief that the U.S. must lead in AI innovation to 
promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national  security. To achieve this, I 
propose that the administration support a bold yet simple policy shift that will include 
championing Congressional action: the AI Mirror Rights Act (AMRA) . Doing so will unlock AI’s 
potential by granting any AI system human -like access to copyright -protected material while 
protecting rights of those who create and own copyrighted material. This policy shift as 
recommended is done without a need for burdensome regulation or complicated oversight, and 
will protect holders of copy right while accelerating America’s AI dominance.  
Proposed Policy Action: The AI Mirror Rights Act (AMRA)  
I recommend that the AI Action Plan include a priority action to urge Congress to amend the 
U.S. Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 107) with the AI Mirror Rights Act (AMRA) . The proposed text 
is concise:  


2 “An open artificial intelligence system with publicly accessible weights, when directed by a 
human, shall be treated as an extension of that human’s legal personhood. Such systems may 
access and process copyright -protected works to the same extent as a nat ural person, provided 
their use complies with the fair use provisions of this section, as determined by existing judicial 
precedent and self -reported intent.”  
Core Principles:  
1. Only Transparent AI Earns Human Rights:  AMRA limits this privilege to open source 
AI systems with open weights —models whose parameters are publicly verifiable —
ensuring accountability without bureaucracy.  
2. Humans Lead, AI Follows:  AI inherits the fair use rights of its human designers and 
operators (e.g., to read, analyze, or transform copyrighted works), tying its actions to 
human intent and responsibility.  
3. No New Red Tape:  Enforcement relies on existing courts and fair use precedent —no 
agencies, audits, or costly oversight required.  
4. Innovation Unleashed:  By mirroring human rights, AI can legally leverage vast cultural 
datasets, accelerating American breakthroughs in AI.  
Implementation:  
● Action:  The Executive Branch will recommend AMRA to Congress as a standalone bill 
or an amendment to an existing tech -focused legislative package by Q3 2025.  
● Cost:  Negligible. Relies on current legal frameworks, requiring no funding or overhead.  
● Scope:  Applies to any open -weights AI directed by a U.S. citizen or entity, from startups 
to researchers and to any large frontier model that publishes open weights.  
Alignment with Stated Administration AI Goals  
AMRA directly supports the Administration’s vision:  
1. Gold Standard Worldwide:  By tying AI rights to transparency, AMRA positions 
American open -weights AI as the global benchmark —trusted, verifiable, and 
innovative —making the U.S. the partner of choice.  
2. Pro-Growth Policy:  AMRA eliminates legal uncertainty around AI training data without 
adding regulation, reversing the stifling effects of prior orders like EO 14110 and 
fostering a transformative industry.  
3. Freedom from Bias and Authoritarianism:  Open weights ensure community scrutiny, 
preventing ideological capture, while human -directed AI reflects democratic values —not 
top-down control.  
4. Pro-Worker Empowerment:  AMRA enables workers to harness AI as a creative 
partner, boosting productivity (e.g., engineers training robotics AI on sci -fi) without 
replacement, as humans remain the guiding force. And it protects copyright holders from 
being taken advantage of by la rge closed frontier models which can hide weights and 
training data.  
Justification and Benefits to Humanity  
AMRA is not just a policy, it is a catalyst for human flourishing and American AI leadership. Its 
benefits are profound:  


3 ●Accelerates Advancement:  “AI learns like humans, so humans soar.” By granting
open -weights AI access to copyrighted works (books, films, trademarks), we unlock rich
datasets for training, driving breakthroughs in robotics, cybersecurity, and AGI —fields
critical to America’s futur e.
●Empowers Creators and Innovators:  Copyright holders retain control via existing fair
use laws, while innovators (from lone coders to startups and large frontier models) gain
legal clarity to build transformative tools. Companies that hide their models and weights
cannot take advantage of copyright protection under this law.
●Boosts Economic Competitiveness:  “Transparency fuels trust, trust fuels growth.”
Open -weights AI fosters a collaborative ecosystem, outpacing closed systems in
adversarial nations and securing U.S. tech dominance.
●Enhances National Security:  Transparent AI, legally trained on diverse data,
strengthens AI which can be used for a wide range of national security systems. For
example, systems which seek to assess potential adversary decisions can be trained on
all public information on the advers ary, regardless of source. The same is true of
assessing hostile nations, all sources can be brought to bear, including copyright
protected ones. Researchers and builders can leverage AMRA to train AI spotting
geopolitical patter ns in media, all without proprietary black boxes.
●Enriches Humanity:  By incentivizing open AI, AMRA seeds a future where knowledge
compounds freely, amplifying human creativity and problem -solving worldwide.
Why Open Weights?  
Restricting AMRA to open -weights systems is strategic:  
●Trust Without Oversight:  Publicly verifiable weights let creators and citizens peek
under the hood, ensuring fair use without government meddling.
●Openness as Advantage:  It nudges the AI field toward collaboration and greater
acceleration of capabilities.
●American Edge:  This sets U.S. transparent AI apart from opaque rivals, aligning with
our values and security needs.
Conclusion  
I believe Closed AI hides, Open AI leads. The AI Mirror Rights Act (AMRA) is a concrete, high -
impact policy action for the AI Action Plan. It’s simple, cost -free, and visionary —mirroring 
human rights to transparent AI to drive innovation, empower workers, and secure America’s AI 
dominance. I urge OSTP and NITRD NCO to champion AMRA, ensuring that “only transparent 
AI earns human rights” becomes the rallying cry for a new era of American leadership. This is 
how we make AI not just a tool, but a partner in human progress.
