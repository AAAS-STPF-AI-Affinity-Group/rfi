Dear Members  of the NITRD  NCO,  
I am writing  to contribute  to the ongoing  discourse  on the development  of an 
Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) Action  Plan, focusing  on the transformative  potential  of AI 
in the U.S. healthcare  system.  Our current  healthcare  infrastructure  is marred  by 
inefficiencies  that not only inflate  costs  but also impede  the delivery  of optimal 
patient  care. AI offers  a unique  opportunity  to address  these  challenges,  fostering 
a system  that is both efficient  and patient -centric.  
1.Inefficiencies  in U.S. Healthcare  and the Transformative  Potential  of AI
The United  States  spent  $4.9 trillion  on healthcare  in 2023,  accounting  for 17.6 
percent  of GDP. This level of spending  is nearly  twice  as high as that of the next- 
highest  country  in the OECD.  Despite  these  expenditures,  U.S. healthcare 
outcomes  remain  poor compared  to peer nations.  The United  States  has the lowest 
life expectancy  and highest  mortality  rate from preventable  and treatable  diseases 
among  developed  countries.  These  statistics  underscore  a fundamental 
inefficiency:  higher  spending  is failing  to translate  into better  patient  outcomes.  
A 2019  study  published  in JAMA  found  that 25 percent  of U.S. healthcare 
spending —between  $760  billion  and $935  billion  annually —is waste.  The sources 
of waste  are diverse,  but a significant  portion  stems  from fraud,  abuse  of the 
system,  and excessive  administrative  overhead.  These  inefficiencies  impose  direct 
costs  on the healthcare  system  and also contribute  to delays  in care, excessive 
paperwork,  and misaligned  incentives  that prioritize  volume  over value.  
AI offers  a transformative  opportunity  to address  these  inefficiencies.  Multiple 
studies  have shown  that AI can enhance  fraud  detection,  flag system  abuse,  and 
automate  routine  clinical  and administrative  tasks  to improve  efficiency,  accuracy,

to reduce  diagnostic  errors,  improve  hospital  operations,  and streamline 
administrative  workflows,  leading  to faster  and more  cost-effective  care. 
Despite  this potential,  AI adoption  in healthcare  remains  extremely  limited.  Few 
hospitals  have successfully  deployed  AI at scale,  even when  evidence  supports  its 
benefits.  The challenges  preventing  widespread  AI implementation  fall into three 
key categories:  operational  difficulties  in AI development,  organizational  resistance 
to AI adoption,  and regulatory  barriers  that limit AI use cases.  The following 
sections  outline  policy  recommendations  to address  each of these  challenges  and 
unlock  AI’s potential  in transforming  the U.S. healthcare  system.  
2.Recommendations
2.1 Overcoming  Operational  Barriers:  Enforcing  Healthcare  Data Interoperability  
Healthcare  data in the United  States  is highly  fragmented,  often  stored  in different 
formats  across  various  providers.  This lack of standardization  makes  it difficult  for 
patients  to access  their own medical  history.  A 2021  Pew study  found  that only 36 
percent  of Americans  reported  that all their healthcare  providers  offered  electronic 
access  to their records.3 This fragmentation  creates  inefficiencies  at every  level of 
the healthcare  system.  Physicians  struggle  to obtain  a complete  view of a patient’s 
medical  history,  delaying  diagnoses  and treatment  decisions.  Pharmaceutical 
companies  face challenges  in evaluating  the long-term effectiveness  of 
medications  due to incomplete  real-world  data.  Administrative  processes  become 
slower  and more  complex  when  providers  must  manually  request  and transfer 
records.  
Beyond  these  immediate  problems,  the lack of interoperability  presents  a major 
barrier  to the development  and deployment  of artificial  intelligence  in healthcare. 
AI models  rely on large,  diverse  datasets  to generalize  effectively,  yet the current 
system  prevents  models  from scaling  beyond  a single  hospital  or care network.  
Without  seamless  data exchange,  AI systems  cannot  reach  their full potential  in 
improving  diagnostics,  optimizing  operations,  and personalizing  treatments.  The 
federal  government  should  enforce  stronger  interoperability  requirements  to 
ensure  that health  data can be easily  shared  across  institutions  while  maintaining

3  security  and patient  privacy.  Concretely,  the federal  government  should  mandate 
one data format  (e.g. FHIR)  and amend  the HIPAA  act to drive  healthcare  data 
interoperability  and improve  access  for health  apps and systems.  
2.2 Addressing  Organizational  Resistance:  Financial  Incentives  for AI Adoption  
Many  hospitals  and care providers  are hesitant  to adopt  AI systems  due to high 
upfront  costs,  uncertainty  about  return  on investment,  and institutional  resistance 
to new technology.  To accelerate  AI adoption,  federal  policy  should  introduce 
financial  incentives  for healthcare  organizations  that implement  AI in ways that 
demonstrably  improve  efficiency  and patient  outcomes.  
Incentives  have repeatedly  been  one of the most  effective  drivers  of technology 
adoption  in healthcare.  A clear precedent  is the rapid  adoption  of Electronic  Health 
Record  systems  following  the passage  of the HITECH  Act. This law authorized 
Medicare  and Medicaid  to provide  financial  incentives  to healthcare  providers  that 
adopted  and meaningfully  used EHR systems.  Within  a decade,  EHR systems 
became  standard  across  nearly  all healthcare  organizations.  
A similar  approach  is needed  for AI. Federal  policy  should  introduce  financial 
incentives  for hospitals  and clinics  that integrate  AI into clinical  and operational 
workflows.  These  incentives  should  reward  AI systems  that enhance  diagnostic 
accuracy,  improve  patient  outcomes,  or reduce  healthcare  costs.  As with the 
HITECH  Act, these  incentives  should  transition  into penalties  for organizations  that 
fail to adopt  proven  AI technologies  within  a reasonable  timeframe.  By tying 
reimbursement  policies  to the use of validated  AI systems,  the government  can 
accelerate  the adoption  of innovations  that improve  care delivery.  
2.3 Removing  Regulatory  Barriers:  Expanding  AI Use Cases  in Healthcare  
Current  regulations  severely  limit the ability  of AI systems  to function 
autonomously  in healthcare.  No AI system  is approved  to make  independent 
diagnostic  decisions  across  multiple  diseases,  and no AI system  is allowed  to 
prescribe  treatments  without  physician  oversight.  While  safeguards  are necessary 
to ensure  patient  safety,  these  restrictions  prevent  AI from delivering  the efficiency 
gains  it is capable  of. If AI-generated  recommendations  always  require  a human 
provider’s  approval,  the benefits  of automation  remain  limited.  
Policymakers  should  focus  on creating  pathways  that allow  AI systems  to take on 
greater  responsibilities  in healthcare,  particularly  in areas  where  they have been 
shown  to match  or exceed  human  performance.  The approval  of autonomous  AI- 
driven  diagnosis  and treatment  should  be prioritized,  provided  these  systems  meet 
rigorous  safety  and efficacy  standards.  H.R.238  is a strong  step in this direction,

under  appropriate  regulatory  oversight.  Similar  legislative  efforts  should  be 
expanded  to enable  AI to handle  a wider  range  of clinical  tasks,  reducing  the 
burden  on human  providers  and improving  access  to timely  medical  care. 
3. Conclusion  
By enforcing  interoperability,  providing  financial  incentives,  and reforming 
regulations  to enable  AI autonomy  where  appropriate,  policymakers  can create  the 
conditions  necessary  for AI to transform  the healthcare  system.  These  changes  will 
reduce  inefficiencies,  improve  patient  outcomes,  and allow  the United  States  to 
remain  at the forefront  of medical  innovation.
