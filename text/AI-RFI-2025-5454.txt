General Comment
I believe that Artificial intelligence holds no future in the future of the US and in allowing this to pass it would not only not help the
Am erican public, but harm  m any. It has and continues to steal from  m any Am erican citizens pockets, livelihoods, and m inds. It is directly
profiting off of the theft of the peoples property. Artificial intelligence will only dam age the Am erican public and their beautiful environm ent
with its beyond harm ful effects on nature. It is tricking the people and fleecing their eyes.
