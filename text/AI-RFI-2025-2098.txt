General Comment
I work for a com pany in the technology sector that has developed copyrighted software for use in m ission critical spaces and SCIFs. It is
param ount to both our econom ic success as a nation and our national security that AI com panies NOT be allowed to train on copyrighted
m aterials without clear prior consent protocols and financial com pensation to rights holders. Any steps taken by the governm ent to waive
existing copyright law for AI software com panies will disincentivize innovation. Shifting the regulatory environm ent to favor AI software
com panies will m ake it easier to create substitute software products that are cheaper, contain m ore cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and give
our adversaries the tools to reverse engineer our products. What individual or com pany would want to innovate if years of work can
sim ply be analyzed and exploited to m ake a cheap copy on behalf of an AI product user or the AI com pany itself? AI has value in its
ability to train on open source m aterials and consenting rights holders, but it is ludicrous to think that subverting copyright law is in the best
interest of the United States econom y or defense posture.
It is doubly im portant that AI products not be allowed to train on any software products being deployed in SCIFs, or on software
products that process Controlled Unclassified Inform ation or Personal Identifying Inform ation. The risks to our national security presented
by this would be unprecedented.
