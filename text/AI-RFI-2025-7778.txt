General Comment
OpenAI should not be allowed to use copyrighted m aterial for its content. No other business is allowed to do so and the original creators
of those works need to be com pensated fairly. Not only would allowing OpenAI to do this destroy jobs because business leaders would
incorrectly believe that AI can replace people, but it would be doing so with stolen labor.
