General Comment
I do not believe AI will benefit the future of Am erica in the realm s of creative and generative occupations and hobbies. I can see its use in
m edical fields, linguistics, and other diagnostic fields to aid in faster work, but not in the arts. It should not be allowed to have copyrights,
patents, or other rights from  things generated by AI as this will enforce that a hum an is ultim ately responsible for the act of creation, thus
m aking it a tool and not a replacem ent for hum an work.
AI in creative areas is at best used for rapid concept generation for breaking art block of lack of vision on direction for an im age or script,
but it m ust not replace end products m ade by people. Otherwise, m ore things becom e created and owned by corporations and not the
people and their cultures. The stories we tell through art should rem ain, in the end, owned by the people who engage with it, and not
corporations, and Generative AI exists solely to exclude people from  art.
