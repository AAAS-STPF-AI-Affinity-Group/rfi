General Comment
This is truly gross. It’s terrible for anyone who holds a copyright or m akes incom e on IP or other proprietary inform ation. It’s terrible for
individuals, businesses, artists, jobs, and innum erable other people and entities. What a gross, blatantly corrupt, obviously anti-hum an
proposal.
