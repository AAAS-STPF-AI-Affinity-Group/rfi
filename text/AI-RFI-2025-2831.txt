General Comment
Copyright laws should not be com prom ised in favor of advancing GenAI. To do so would be to open the door for the looting of
intelectual property. This would have a devistating im pact on sm aller business and freelance creators, but larger com panies would not be
spared either. Why would I go see a m ovie in theaters or from  a stram ing service when I could get a GenAI to m ake one? Why would I
subscribe to a GenAI service when I could find an open source m odel and feed whatever I want into it without consequence?
Do not com prom ise laws for these com panies. Every other com pany m ust abide by them , why should GenAI be any different? It's no
m ore the future than NFTs were.
