General Comment
We m ust protect creative careers against Generative AI and Large Language Models. Copyright should be upheld against this technology.
The technology is plateauing in its effectiveness, and the attem pt to overrules copyright law in an attem pt to further its developm ent is a
fundam entally unscrupulous and desperate power grab. The current state of AI does not truly im prove productivity as prom ised, and
instead is m uddying the quality of hum an culture and understanding with m ere approxim ations of hum an ability. A quantity over quality
technology which stands to weaken us.
Fundam entally, Google and OpenAI have no right to develop their product using the products of others they have no claim  to. An arm s
race with China's AI developm ent is a pretense to steal the rightly owned efforts of m illions of Am ericans and Am erican businesses.
Ultim ately this weakens trust in our institutions and thereby the strength of our nation. In addition, AI shows worrisom e signs of being a
m arket bubble, threatening to pop. The winner of this "Arm s Race" m ay be the nation who refrains from  putting all their eggs in that
basket, and underm ining copyright is akin to shaking that basket.
