Dear Mr. D’Souza  
 
Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the above -
referenced Request for Information (RFI).1 Lilly is one of the country’s leading innovation -driven, 
research -based pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporations. Our company is devoted to seeking 
answers for some of the world’s most urgent medical needs through discovery and development of 
breakth rough medicines. Ultimately, our goal is to develop products that save and improve patients’ 
lives. We recognize the tremendous potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the healthcare 
landscape, and we are eager to contribute to shaping an AI  policy framework that fosters innovation 
while safeguarding public health, security, and privacy. Our comments below reflect our focus on 
leveraging AI to drive biomedical advancement and improve public health outcomes.  
 
National Security  
Lilly recognizes the critical intersection of biopharmaceuticals, AI, and national security, particularly 
in addressing emerging AI -driven biosecurity threats. As AI continues to evolve, it is imperative that 
federal regulators take proactive steps to safe guard public health, while fostering innovation in the 
biopharmaceutical sector. Lilly believes that strengthening protections for the domestic 
biopharmaceutical industry enhances the nation’s ability to counter emerging biosecurity risks, 
while reinforcin g its leadership in global health security. Moreover, AI -driven synthetic biology 
threats pose unique challenges that require both public and private sectors to work together in 
developing robust strategies to mitigate risks and maintain national resilienc e. Below, we provide 
key recommendations to strengthen national security and mitigate risks associated with AI -driven 
biological threats:  
 
• Regulators should designate key biopharmaceutical manufacturers as national security 
assets to protect against foreign influence and ensure stability in public health 
preparedness  – Lilly supports formally classifying select pharmaceutical companies as national 
security assets, acknowledging their critical role in national defense and emergency response. 
This designation would provide protections against foreign takeovers or undue influence, 
particularly from nations whose interests may conflict with U.S. security priorities. Safeguarding

domestic biopharmaceutical companies would strengthen the nation’s ability to respond to 
health emergencies and mitigate AI -driven biosecurity risks.  
•Pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities should be classified as critical infrastructure to
enhance security against cyberattacks, terrorism, and AI -driven biological threats  –
Federal agencies should establish policies that categorize pharmaceutical manufacturing sites as
critical infrastructure, ensuring they receive enhanced security measures and protections. This
classification would enable increased investment in cybersec urity defenses, emergency
preparedness programs, and risk mitigation strategies aga inst AI -driven threats, such as
synthetic biology misuse. By formally recognizing the pharmaceutical sector as part of critical
infrastructure, regulators can help protect the industry from emerging risks and maintain
national health security.
•The AI Action Plan should include directives to establish a national biosecurity strategy to
strengthen the nation’s preparedness for AI -driven biological threats  – Lilly supports
establishing a comprehensive national biosecurity strategy that outlines clear protocols for
responding to AI -generated biological threats, including the potential use of AI in developing
synthetic pathogens. This strategy should include collaboration between government agencies,
the biopharmaceutical industry, and national defens e organizations to ensure a coordinated
response to emerging threats. Implementing a forward -looking regulatory framework would
ensure federal agencies can bolster national resilience against AI -driven biosecurity risks while
fostering innovation in the bi opharmaceutical sector.
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity 
As AI becomes increasingly embedded in health care operations, data privacy and cybersecurity 
frameworks should evolve to balance innovation with robust protections for personal health 
information. Lilly supports targeted, sector -specific updates to privac y regulations that reflect the 
opportunities and challenges posed by AI, ensuring continued medical innovation while safeguarding 
sensitive data. To this end, we recommend the following:  
•Regulators should update HIPAA regulations and other health privacy frameworks to
address AI -driven technologies that process personal health information  – Federal agencies
should modernize existing health privacy regulations to ensure that AI applications handling
personal health data are appropriately regulated. This includes clarifying how AI technologies
interact with HIPAA protections and establishing  guidelines that allow for responsible AI -driven
research in drug discovery and clinical trials while m aintaining strong patient privacy standards.
Lilly believes that refining privacy laws to account for AI’s role in health care would support both
innovation and consumer trust in AI -driven medical advancements.
•Cybersecurity standards should be tailored to AI -driven biopharmaceutical research and
manufacturing to mitigate the risks of cyber threats and data breaches  – Federal agencies
should introduce cybersecurity guidelines specifically designed to protect AI -driven research,
development, and manufacturing in the biopharmaceutical industry. These guidelines should
promote the adoption of advanced cybersecurity tech nologies, such as encryption and AI -
powered threat detection, while ensuring that regulations remai n adaptable to emerging threats.
Targeted cybersecurity requirements can help protect sensitive health data and prevent
cyberattacks on pharmaceutical infrastructure.

Research and Development (R&D) 
Lilly supports the continued growth in the use of AI to drive meaningful advances in drug discovery 
and development, clinical trials, and regulatory review, and we suggest that federal regulators’ efforts 
focus on creating an environment that encourages in novation while safeguarding public health. We 
recommend that any regulatory actions related to AI technologies prioritize providing clarity, 
flexibility, and standardized approaches to facilitate the development and approval of life -saving 
treatments, espe cially for patients with rare or underserved conditions. Below we provide additional 
recommendations related to the use of AI in R&D and clinical trials:  
•Regulatory guidance should spur the use of innovative approaches to development while
ensuring that new technologies are properly validated and monitored – Drugs discovered
and developed leveraging AI technology should continue to meet the same safety and efficacy
standards as drugs developed with traditional methods. As also described in the recent FDA
Guidance “ Considerations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence To Support Regulatory Decision -
Making for Drug and Biological Products ”, AI algorithms should be free from bias and avoid
exacerbating health disparities. The integration of AI technology and good manufacturing
processes into drug discovery, research, and development brings promising benefits to patients,
yet its potential c ontinues to emerge.
Therefore, any actions to regulate AI technology should consider the implications of jeopardizing 
innovation within the full drug lifecycle. Federal regulators should seek to provide regulatory 
certainty and adoption of standardized approaches for the use of AI technologies to maintain a 
gold standard of safety and efficacy as well as help to encourage the appropriate adoption of AI 
within drug discovery and R&D.  
•Regulators should support the potential for AI to meaningfully advance medical
discoveries for rare disease and disease with unmet medical need  – AI has the potential to
promote efficiencies and increase the availability of treatments, especially for patients battling
rare diseases and those with unmet medical needs. AI’s capabilities in early drug discovery,
particularly in identifying new thera peutic targets, could revolutionize the way we approach
medical challenges in underserved therapeutic areas.
•Regulatory guidance and frameworks should provide greater clarity and predictability
regarding acceptance of the use of AI within clinical trials – Lilly believes that  AI algorithms
used in clinical trials must be validated during the FDA regulatory review process to mitigate the
risk of bias in data and to ensure the integrity of clinical outcomes. As drug developers continue
to enhance the representativeness of trial d ata sets, AI tools can be used to mitigate algorithmic
bias and improve health outcomes if used appropriately.
However, a challenging aspect to leveraging AI in clinical trials is understanding whether the data 
sets used by or to inform AI algorithms are comprehensive and non -biased. Additionally, developers 
need certainty from regulators regarding their acceptance  of AI tools within clinical study, which 
ideally will include a recognition that regulators will remain flexible as the use of AI in clinical trials 
continues to evolve.   
Intellectual Property and Innovation  
Lilly supports the use of AI technology in developing innovative, patentable medicines, which 
accelerates medical innovation, and believes that intellectual property (IP) protections should 
continue to reward human creativity. Additionally, Lilly advocates  for clearer criteria around IP

protections for medicines developed using AI, as strong and clear IP safeguards are critical to 
sustaining the pace of biomedical discovery and ensuring the continued advancement of life -saving 
treatments. To this end, we recommend the following:  
•The USPTO guidance position that AI -assisted inventions are not categorically
unpatentable for improper inventorship should be maintained  – IP protections for AI -
assisted innovation should continue to appropriately reward human creativity that remains
fundamental to AI -assisted medical innovation, thus promoting the progress of science and
improving the lives of patients.
•Regulators should clarify the criteria for IP protections for medicines using AI technology
during discovery – IP protections for AI technology need clarity and should remain strong as IP
is the backbone of continued drug discovery and advancements into biomedical innovation.
Without strong and sufficient protections for IP, the biomedical industry could not cont inue at its
historic pace of bringing treatments and cures to patients as quickly as possible.
*** 
Lilly strongly supports the advancement of AI technologies within the biopharmaceutical industry, 
particularly in drug discovery, research, and development. We recognize that the intersection of AI 
with public health, national security, and IP requires tho ughtful, coordinated action from federal 
agencies, private industry, and academic institutions. As AI continues to evolve, it is imperative that 
policymakers create regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation while safeguarding privacy, 
national securi ty, and fairness. Lilly looks forward to continued collaboration with the NITRD and 
other stakeholders to build a future where AI can be fully leveraged to benefit patients, strengthen 
public health, and drive biomedical breakthroughs. Thank you for your c onsideration of these 
important issues.
