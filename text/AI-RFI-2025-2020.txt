General Comment
The reckless and illegal m ethods technology com panies have em ployed to develop so-called "Artificial Intelligence (AI)" cannot be
allowed to continue. Their flagrant abuse of, and contem pt for, intellectual property and copyright laws not only m ust stopped, these
com panies should be forced to face the sam e consequences any other organization or individual would norm ally face if they them selve
violates these sam e laws.
These com panies have produced nothing of value, but have caused incalculable dam age in their wake. It should not be allowed to
continue. The Am erican people should not be on the hook for these com panies short-sighted and ill-fated business investm ents. Just like
everyone else, if your business "cannot exist" without breaking the law, then it shouldn't exist. The law should not be changed instead to let
it. 
Outrageous this even needs to be put into words, yet here we are.
