General Comment
AI is nothing m ore than a plagiarism  m achine that can only "create" by stealing other people's intellectual property. It's inaccurate,
unreliable and cannot produce consistent answers or results. It m akes things up wholecloth and does so indiscrim inately. It's not som e
m agical entity with a consciousness pulling creativity from  the ether, it's a m ulcher gobbling up inform ation it is fed and spitting out an
am algam ation of what it ate. 
It's not a good investm ent, as inevitably it will be stealing m assive com pany's intellectual property, creating not only a liability but a waste
of energy. There are no original ideas from  AI and this is proven by how badly Sam  Altm an et al insist that they be able to train their
program s on existing art and writing. It would be nothing without what is shoveled into it. It cannot m ake anything on its own. 
AI is no m ore than som eone eating a bar of chocolate and then presenting you with their fecal waste afterwards going "well it is brown,
and I m ade it FROM chocolate, so this is chocolate". I'm  not eating that.
