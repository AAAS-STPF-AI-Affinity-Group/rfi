General Comment
It's rather absurd to suggest that an action that would be illegal for a private individual (taking copyright m aterial without perm ission)
should be legal for a large com pany or large organization. There can be no reasonable justification to allow private organizations to steal
copyright m aterial en m asse while still punishing individuals for copyright infringem ent.
