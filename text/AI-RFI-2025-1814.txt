General Comment
AI dom inance isn't as im portant as protecting the creative work of every individual. The ouroboros this would create, AI looping in on
itself, would even lead to Google and other tech com panies' software and content becom ing free under such a law. They'd destroy
them selves just because they realize there's no other way to get what they want from  the investm ents they put in that are failing.
I've been writing online for m y own genre fan site for over a decade, while creating original works I hope to one day see published, but if
a m achine from  a com pany that only wants to m ake m oney will be allowed to take it and m ake it it's own... what's the point? What's the
point of creating anything new if they can snatch it from  m e and profit from  it, leaving m e without anything for it? Who will want to create
in an environm ent like that? No one. Am erica will be a laughing stock com pared to the rest of the world. And for what? Som e tech
com pany's m oney? I think the answer is clear: this should never becom e a law or else this dom inance they claim  to seek... it'll undo
everything and we'll all end up with nothing, even the tech com panies.
