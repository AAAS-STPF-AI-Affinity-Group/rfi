General Comment
Absolutely do not increase or fund so-called "AI." These business m odels revolve around theft of people's creative work and are thus
legally unstable, are unreliable and produce poor and inaccurate inform ation, and are a disaster for the environm ent due to their energy
consum ption. The only "AI Action Plan" we need is to ban this nonsense.
