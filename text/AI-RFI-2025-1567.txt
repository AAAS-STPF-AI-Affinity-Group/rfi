General Comment
I believe that any developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence plan that does not take into heavy consideration the rights of creative individuals,
their creations, and the appropriate copyright of the latter, is an egregious abuse of power. AI is a tool, and it is a tool that should be
heavily regulated or we risk the dissolution of any and all m eaning to work that is possible solely through the creative intelligence and
genius of the hum an m ind.
AI will never be a perfect replicant of the hum an m ind; on the contrary, whatever it creates will be a sad facsim ile.
I sincerely hope SIGNIFICANT further consideration is given to any and all AI related policies, as well as to the m any voices of the
governm ent's constituents (the people it is sworn to serve and listen to), who are speaking up against the blatant disregard the current
adm inistration seem s to hold for the rights of individuals.
