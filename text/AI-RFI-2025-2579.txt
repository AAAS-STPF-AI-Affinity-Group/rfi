General Comment
AI is fundam ental strain on the environm ent and has not produced anything to prove it is a worthwhile investm ent. The future of Am erican
jobs are being destroyed by this in an a desperate attem pt to put value on a losing investm ent. No funds should be spent towards this
industry until they can prove to actually m ake som ething useful from  it. Until then it is a blight on society and the econom y.
