General Comment
I am  absolutely opposed to allowing open and unfettered AI developm ent, without guardrails or protections. I am  concerned for the
security of m y personal inform ation, as well as the waste of water and other environm ental resources that are used for AI developm ent. 
There should be serious professional regulations for the developm ent of AI, to ensure that the privacy of individuals and organizations is
respected and AI is utilized as a benefit to society, rather than a hazard.
