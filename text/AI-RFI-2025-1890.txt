General Comment
Generative AI m ay have the appearance of learning, but it lacks actual m ental processes. It's at best the big brother to your phone's
autocom plete, and at worst, a plagiarism  m achine trained to steal others' work. It's insulting to creatives, a copyright nightm are for
corporations, and losing popularity as quickly as NFTs did. Generative AI is worthless, and a poor substitute for a hum an worker in any
position (with the possible exception of CEO - but to be fair, that's a job that doesn't require m uch brains or talent anyway).
That being said, it's im portant to note that there are form s of AI that are NOT generative - these form s of AI can be used to track cancer
cells, pilot drones in space, and m any m ore things that are beyond the capabilities of a person when lives hang in the balance. These form s
of AI are useful to m ankind, serving as a tool rather than a shabby replacem ent for hum an workers.
