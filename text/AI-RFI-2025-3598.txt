General Comment
AI can only create from  existing sources to work. It is thus plagiarizing and stealing work from  people. If we critique and m ake students
upload their own essays and other projects to test for plagiarizing, how is AI any different? This is setting up a future for Am ericans where
rules like copyright/tradem ark laws are only protected for big corporations and will eventually take away m ore jobs from  hum ans in
preference to a cheap gim m ick. Without hum an creation and input, AI can’t work and shouldn’t unless the com panies pay the artists and
other people they use to teach their program m ing. If you have any m oral understanding and care m ore about those you govern, you would
actually listen, rather than letting lobbyists pay you for your votes.
