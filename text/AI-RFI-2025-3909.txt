General Comment
We need to prioritize the citizens of this country by ensuring plans that AI will not replace workers, displace workers, and that AI m ust
respect copyrights. AI should not be using copyrighted m aterial for training and should be held accountable in the event that they do.
Prioritize people, not AI
