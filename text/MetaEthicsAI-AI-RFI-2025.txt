Submitted by email to:  
Dear Mr. D’Souza:  
MetaEthics AI appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy’s (OSTP) Request for Information regarding the development of an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. We commend the Administration’s dedication to 
collaborating with organizations such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 
whose call for input on AI underscores the necessity of leveraging standards to strengthen 
American leadership in AI. Just as important, ANSI’s emphasis on global engag ement 
aligns with our belief that forging international partnerships is vital to harnessing AI’s 
potential for the collective good and bridging divides across nations.  
At MetaEthics AI, our mission is to develop ethically grounded AI systems informed by 
robust philosophical frameworks, historical insights, and continuous societal feedback. 
We recognize that efforts to create shared AI standards can not only enhance trust  in new 
technologies, but also facilitate dialogue across diverse cultural and geopolitical 
landscapes. Toward that end, we have pioneered Social Functional Categorization 
Theory (SFCT) —an adaptive, ethics -focused framework designed to quantify AI’s impact 
on society in dynamic, context -sensitive ways.  
Informed by ANSI’s call for greater collaboration and standardization, we propose the 
following priority areas to ensure that the AI Action Plan fosters both domestic and 
international engagement:  
 
1. Universal Ethical Evaluation of AI Systems  
• Harmonize Domestic and International Standards  
Partner with ANSI, international standards bodies (e.g., ISO/IEC, IEEE), and other 
relevant stakeholders to create shared evaluation benchmarks for AI ethics and risk 
assessment.  


•Integrate Adaptive Ethical Frameworks
Encourage AI developers to adopt methodologies like SFCT, ensuring that ethical
guidelines evolve with cultural shifts and emerging technologies.
2.Transparency and Explainability
•Global “Explainability Scorecards”
Develop consistent, internationally recognized “explainability scorecards” that offer
clear, accessible insight into AI’s decision logic.
•Periodic Data and Bias Audits
Mandate regular reports detailing data sources, methodology, detected biases, and
remediation efforts —facilitating comparability across borders and organizations.
3.Enhanced National Security through Ethical AI
•International Coordination on Dual -Use AI  
Coordinate with global partners to establish guidelines for identifying and mitigating
dual-use AI technologies. Such collaboration can reduce misunderstanding,
encourage responsible research, and mitigate threats before they escalate.
•Multinational Threat Intelligence Task Forces
Form cross -border task forces involving security agencies and industry experts to
share real -time AI intelligence, ensuring swift response to global threats.
4.Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Public Participation
•Global AI Ethics Forums
Convene public forums —nationally and internationally —to gather input from
academia, industry, civil society, and the public, ensuring that policy formulation
reflects a diversity of perspectives and fosters mutual understanding.
•Standards -Driven Incentive Programs
Establish grants and collaborative initiatives that encourage multi -stakeholder
research on AI’s social impacts, informed by existing and emerging international
standards.
5.Equitable Economic Prosperity and Workforce Resilience
•AI Workforce Reskilling Consortia
Fund programs that unite governments, educational institutions, and industry
players worldwide to equip at -risk communities with AI -related job skills, fostering
inclusive economic growth.


• Global AI Impact Dashboard  
Partner with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and international equivalents to create a 
shared “AI Impact Dashboard,” promoting transparent tracking of labor market 
shifts, wage trends, and employment disruptions on a global scale.  
6. Adaptation of AI to Biotechnological Systems  
• Cross-Border Collaboration for Public Health  
Support research consortia that combine AI -driven biotech innovations with global 
regulatory standards, accelerating progress in diagnostics, preventive care, and 
sustainable agriculture.  
• Streamlined Approval for International Needs  
Develop standardized review pathways —aligned with international guidelines —to 
speed the safe deployment of biotech solutions in crises or areas of significant 
humanitarian need.  
7. Establishing an International Independent AI Committee  
Given the global implications of AI’s rapid evolution, we strongly endorse the creation of an 
International Independent AI Committee , potentially in partnership with standards 
organizations like ANSI and recognized global bodies. Such a committee would:  
• Coordinate Ethical and Technical Standards  
Facilitate alignment across diverse regulatory and standards frameworks, reducing 
redundancies and bridging cultural divides.  
• Provide a Neutral Conflict Resolution Forum  
Offer a venue where policymakers, industry, and civil society can address disputes, 
promote best practices, and share knowledge.  
• Ensure Long -Term Sustainable AI Development  
Maintain an evolving roadmap that reflects new technological milestones, emerging 
ethical dilemmas, and fresh insights gained from real -world AI deployments.  
 
In conclusion, MetaEthics AI is prepared to collaborate with the OSTP, ANSI, and the 
broader global community to develop and operationalize an AI Action Plan that unifies 
international perspectives, fosters high ethical standards, and demonstrates leadersh ip in 
responsible AI innovation. By embracing transparency, adaptability, and a commitment to 
bridging divides, the United States can guide AI’s transformative capabilities toward serving 
humanity’s shared interests.  


We appreciate your time and consideration.
