Enabling Technological Progress and American AI Dominance through the Diffusion of AI 
Knowledge in the AI Action Plan 
Comment of Professor Kevin Frazier on the Request for Information on the Development 
of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan

I. Introduction
I respectfully submit this Comment to the National Science Foundation (“NSF”) in 
response to its Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) 
Action Plan.1 I am a Professor of Law at the St. Thomas University Benjamin L. Crump College 
of Law, a Fellow of the Lawfare Institute, and a Senior Research Affiliate of the Institute for Law 
and Artificial Intelligence; my expertise is in national security and AI, and I have published 
extensively on topics such as innovation, individual liberty, and American dominance in AI.2 
Thus, I welcome the opportunity to provide input on President Trump’s upcoming AI Action 
Plan.  
This Comment recommends that the AI Action Plan prioritize a national strategy for AI 
literacy—one that systematically breaks down geographic barriers to AI knowledge and creates 
pathways for all Americans to participate in the AI economy. Recent research reveals a troubling 
reality: communities more than 125 miles from AI hotspots see 17% lower growth in AI-related 
jobs and innovation, creating widening opportunity gaps between coastal tech hubs and the rest 
of America.3 A national strategy for AI literacy would support American AI technological 
progress and American AI dominance through the diffusion of scientific knowledge and 
expertise. For the U.S. to maintain technological leadership, it must do more than establish AI 
literacy in a few centers—it demands a comprehensive approach to diffusing AI knowledge 
across the country, much as the Rural Electrification Administration once transformed America 
by spreading both electrical infrastructure and practical knowledge to communities far from

II. Current Gaps in the Diffusion of AI Knowledge and Expertise
The current distribution of AI expertise and understanding in the United States reveals 
concerning disparities. A growing body of research—including Professor Hunt’s 
research—demonstrates that there is a stark geographic concentration of AI knowledge in 
pre-existing innovation hubs. The “superstar” cities of the last wave of technological innovation 
are doubling down on their talent and infrastructure to thrive in the AI era.4 While their success 
is laudable, the fact that the rest of America is missing out raises concerns. “AI innovation 
hotspots,” to borrow Hunt’s term, have disproportionately high rates of AI hiring, growth in AI 
R&D, and overall economic growth. Those economic and knowledge gains, though, are not 
spreading. A lack of digital skills and knowledge persists in communities with lower educational 
attainment,5 less economic security,6 and more rural geographic settings.7 
These geographic disparities in AI expertise manifest in several ways. Large enterprises, 
particularly those near AI innovation centers, are rapidly incorporating AI capabilities; Hunt’s 
work shows that finance and insurance industries, traditionally concentrated in major 
metropolitan areas, are seeing some of the fastest growth in AI job postings. Meanwhile, 
businesses in sectors like retail trade and warehousing, often located away from tech hubs, show 
markedly  slower AI adoption rates8—as do smaller businesses.9 The differences in AI uptick

among different industries means that while one region’s workforce upskills on a daily basis, 
other regions will see their laborers struggle to keep up with new AI advances. Workers in the 
latter communities both now and for the foreseeable future will find themselves on the wrong 
side of the tech boom. As time passes, their counterparts in AI hotspots will accumulate ever 
more knowledge as to the risks and benefits of AI. 
The education sector presents another troubling dimension of this knowledge gap. While 
universities in AI hotspots are rapidly expanding their AI curricula and research programs to 
cater to local employers, educational institutions outside of these areas lack the faculty expertise 
or resources to offer meaningful AI education.10 Hunt et al.'s finding that distance from AI 
research centers significantly impacts the growth of AI-related educational opportunities 
suggests a self-reinforcing cycle of knowledge concentration. 
Perhaps most concerning is the trend of leading AI researchers gravitating toward private 
industry rather than public-facing roles. Hunt et al.’s research notes that companies in AI 
hotspots can offer significantly higher compensation, drawing talent away from positions that 
might help spread AI knowledge more broadly. Industry organizations are also able to provide 
more access to computing power,11 and the proportion of industry-affiliated research has only 
risen with the dominance of compute-demanding large language models.12 This brain drain from 
public institutions further concentrates AI expertise in select private companies and locations. 
III. Diffusing Emerging Technology Knowledge is Essential to Technological Progress
Historical precedents demonstrate that broad diffusion of technological knowledge is
crucial for maximizing societal benefits.13 The electrification of America offers an instructive 
parallel. While initial electrical innovations were concentrated in urban centers, the 20th 
Century’s Rural Electrification Administration recognized that spreading both electrical 
infrastructure and knowledge about its applications was essential for national development. This 
dual focus on physical infrastructure and knowledge diffusion transformed American agriculture 
and rural industry.14 By supporting local cooperatives and private utilities in expanding service to 
rural communities, the Administration helped double the number of rural farms with electricity 
within just five years.15

The internet's development provides a more recent example. While early internet 
innovations emerged from concentrated research centers, deliberate efforts to spread both 
internet access and digital literacy were crucial for realizing the technology's full potential. The 
creation of the National Research and Education Network by President George H. W. Bush and 
subsequent educational initiatives helped ensure that internet knowledge wasn't confined to 
technical specialists.16 
Hunt et al.'s research supports this historical pattern. They find that regions with greater 
AI knowledge diffusion, as measured by the presence of both research and practical applications, 
show faster overall AI adoption and innovation. This suggests that concentrating AI expertise in 
a few centers may actually slow down broader technological progress. 
Moreover, broader technological understanding supports more informed public discourse 
and policy-making. When the public has a basic grasp of a technology's capabilities and 
limitations, policy discussions can focus on substantive issues rather than misconceptions. This is 
particularly crucial for AI, where public misconceptions  could lead to either unwarranted fear or 
dangerous overconfidence. 
IV . Diffusion of AI Knowledge is Essential to America's AI Dominance
The research suggests that America's continued AI leadership requires more than just 
concentrated excellence in a few centers—especially as allies and competitor nations are racing 
ahead on promoting the AI knowledge diffusion. China’s AI strategy has long emphasized a need 
to “comprehensively improve the level of the whole society on the application of AI.”17 Just last 
year, Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced an “AI Plus” initiative as part of an effort to “fully 
integrate digital technology into the real economy,”18 and AI is being incorporated at all levels of 
Chinese public education.19 Similarly, Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that “the most 
important issue [facing Russia] is whether our society and people are ready for the pervasive 
implementation of [AI],” calling for “mass digital literacy and re-training programmes.”20

Countries including France,21 the UK,22 Saudi Arabia,23 Singapore,24 Malaysia,25 and Canada26 
have recognized the importance of or are actively promoting national AI literacy. Maintaining 
competitiveness in AI will require that the U.S. does the same.  
As an aside, which of the aforementioned national efforts merits emulating is unclear. 
The UK spun its program up in early 2025. France’s program started in 2018 and has already 
managed to significantly increase the number of computer science graduates. The CanCode 
program in Canada, established in 2017, has likewise documented a substantial uptick in AI 
knowledge among its hundreds of thousands of young participants.27 A commitment to AI 
literacy in the US may involve borrowing parts of these and other programs. 
Preventing uneven adoption rates is crucial for maintaining public support for AI 
development. If some regions are indeed falling significantly behind in AI adoption, then the 
country is at risk of creating “AI deserts” where lack of exposure breeds resistance to the 
technology. This could lead to political pushback against AI development, similar to historical 
reactions against other unevenly distributed technological changes. 
More broadly distributed AI knowledge would also help address workforce adaptation 
challenges. Regions with better access to AI knowledge see higher growth in jobs adapting AI to 
new uses, rather than just jobs being replaced by AI. This suggests that spreading AI literacy 
could help more workers transition to AI-enhanced roles rather than being displaced. 
V . Recommendations for the AI Action Plan on the Diffusion of AI Knowledge
Drawing on research findings28 about geographic barriers to AI knowledge diffusion, the 
AI Action Plan should consider several time-horizons for spreading AI literacy: 
Short-term initiatives (1-4 years) should focus on breaking down immediate barriers to 
AI knowledge diffusion. The research shows that physical distance from AI hotspots 
significantly impedes knowledge transfer. To counter this, the Plan could propose:

●Creating a national AI extension service, modeled after agricultural extension programs,
to bring AI expertise to underserved areas
●Establishing regional AI resource centers that can serve as intermediaries between major
research hubs and local communities
●Developing standardized AI literacy curricula that can be rapidly deployed through
existing educational institutions
●Incentivizing AI experts to spend time teaching and consulting in regions currently
lacking AI expertise
Medium-term strategies (5-10 years) should focus on building sustainable AI education
capacity across the country. Hunt et al.'s finding that distance reduces growth in both research 
and practical AI applications suggests the need for developing local expertise. Key 
considerations include: 
●Supporting the development of AI faculty at regional universities and community
colleges
●Creating partnerships between AI hotspot institutions and more distant educational
institutions
●Developing specialized AI programs tailored to regional economic needs
●Establishing AI research facilities in currently underserved regions to create new
knowledge hubs
Long-term initiatives (10+ years) should aim to create an ecosystem for continuous AI
learning and adaptation. The paper's evidence that state borders impede knowledge flow suggests 
the need for stronger national infrastructure for AI knowledge sharing. Components might 
include: 
●Building a national platform for AI continuing education
●Creating mechanisms for sharing AI expertise between industries and regions
●Developing standards for AI education and certification
●Establishing frameworks for public-private partnerships in AI education
The Plan should distinguish between different levels of AI knowledge needed because
different industries and occupations require varying levels of AI expertise. General AI 
literacy—basic understanding of AI capabilities, limitations, and implications—is needed 
broadly. More specialized knowledge—such as AI system development or domain-specific AI 
applications—is needed in specific sectors and roles.

VI. Conclusion
Geographic disparities in AI knowledge suggest that current approaches to AI 
development may be suboptimal. While concentrated centers of AI excellence have driven 
impressive advances, the barriers to knowledge diffusion are limiting broader technological 
progress and potentially creating societal divisions. 
The AI Action Plan offers an opportunity to address these challenges by taking a more 
comprehensive approach to AI knowledge diffusion. By considering short-, medium-, and 
long-term initiatives to spread both general and specialized AI knowledge, the Plan could help 
ensure that America's AI leadership is built on a broader and more sustainable foundation than 
just a few centers of excellence. 
Success in the global AI race will require both maintaining America's leading edge in advanced 
AI research and ensuring that AI knowledge and capabilities are widely distributed throughout 
the country. As Hunt et al.'s research demonstrates, distance from AI hotspots currently impedes 
this distribution. By deliberately addressing these barriers through a comprehensive approach to 
AI knowledge diffusion, the AI Action Plan could help ensure that America's AI leadership is 
both technologically advanced and societally sustainable. 
This balanced approach—maintaining concentrated excellence while actively spreading 
knowledge—may be essential for achieving the Executive Order's goal of enhancing America's 
AI dominance. It would create a more resilient AI ecosystem less dependent on a few geographic 
centers and better able to adapt to unexpected technological developments like DeepSeek's recent 
advances. 
The success of such an approach will require sustained commitment and coordination 
across government, industry, and academia. However, the potential benefits—from more 
widespread AI innovation to better-informed public discourse about AI—suggest that such 
investment in AI knowledge diffusion could be crucial for America's technological future.
