General Comment
AI is an overhyped technology and does not deserve blanket protection from  copyright infringem ent. 
Copyright laws exist to protect creators like artists, writers, and m usicians. They would be crushed if com panies like OpenAI can legally
steal from  them . Do not let them  steal inform ation.
