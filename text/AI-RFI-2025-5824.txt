General Comment
I believe this choice to give AI com panies the run of everything ever m ade will not only be harm ful to artists, but to our econom y as well.
AI has already taken over m any processes and jobs that hum ans have historically m anned. I believe it would be fatal to not only thousands
of jobs, but also the livelihoods of sm all, non-corporate artists who rely on their craft to survive. Please do not pass this.
