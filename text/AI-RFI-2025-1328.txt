General Comment
My nam e is Mackenzie Dawson and I am  a m em ber of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High School. I com pleted a sem ester
course on AI and Ethics and studied the im pacts of Generative AI on the sports com m unities, particularly volleyball. EO 14179 will
im prove and policy about innovation and com petition should be based on the effects that AI can have on a wide variety of sports that are
played globally. However, with advancem ents in Am erican AI technology, we can establish an advantage over other countries in
im plem enting AI in the sports world. My research on that specific topic has provided m e with the knowledge that AI is beginning to
establish its connections to sports through video analysis technology to provide insight into film  analysis that we have not had prior. Being
able to identify things that are im possible to recognize with just the hum an eye when it com es to strategy and placem ent based on the
identified positioning of players and the gam e itself, is a new idea in itself, and with this executive order backing its ideals, the possibilities
of AI in the future of sports in Am erica are endless.
