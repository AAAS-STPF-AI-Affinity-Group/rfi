General Comment
Please do not do this. AI can only steal. It is not a m iracle product that is the cure to hum an creative drought, it is a class of software that
is designed to paraphrase what it has seen. It is fed copyrighted work, and it outputs pseudo-sim ilar work. It does not have the ability to
be inspired. All AI work is stolen.
