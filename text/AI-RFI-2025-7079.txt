General Comment
Generative AI is theft. Plain and sim ple. It is scraping the internet and using the works of people who DID NOT CONSENT to train
m odels that then put people out of work. It would be like som eone taking the code for Google, or Am azon, and copying it to create a
com peting website. Its unethical, its theft, and it puts Am erican's out of work. This will do nothing but hurt us.
