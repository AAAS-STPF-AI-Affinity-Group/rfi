General Comment
It should be illegal to use copyrighted m aterials to train artificial intelligence or large language m odels. It allows people to generate text
using interpolations of copyrighted works of others without com pensation or citations. OpenAI and other com panies are taking advantage
of the hard work and personal property of artists, and if they are allowed to do so legally, then personal property rights are perm anently
dim inished. The governm ent should have to m eaningfully explain how private property and copyright can stand when these com panies can
run roughshod over your rights for personal gain.
