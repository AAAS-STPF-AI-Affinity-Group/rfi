General Comment
AI com panies should be responsible for training their own AI with their own data. The focus for AI right now should be efficiency of
training, not attem pting to devour as m uch data as possible. As im pressive as these AI m odels were when they first hit the spotlight, it did
not take long for their cracks to show. They are horribly inefficient and their output is not worth the trouble it takes to get there.
