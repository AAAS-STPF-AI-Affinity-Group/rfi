General Comment
Please do not allow OpenAI the ability to use intellectual property for free and with im m unity from  lawsuits. It is unthinkable that original
property should be allowed to be used in this way with no legal recourse for the owner if it is used without their perm ission. We are a
country based on rule of law and with respect for the rights of all property owners; this decision would m ake a m ockery of that. Please do
the right thing and deny Open AI these actions.
