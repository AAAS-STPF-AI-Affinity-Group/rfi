General Comment
I do not believe that AI holds a place in the future of the United States. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of
theft. It's a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and legal problem s by enabling
them . Nvidia's $600 billion m arket cap drop was not an accident. AI is a speculative bubble waiting to pop.
