General Comment
I am  a professional writer, a book author, and a professor. We should absolutely not be granting OpenAI and sim ilar generative AI
com panies free rein to use copyrighted m aterial to train their large language m odels and other generative AI projects.
We have a rich history of copyright protection in this country, and it can't and shouldn't be undone with the stroke of a pen in the nam e of
progress. Show som e respect for those of us who have worked and sweated through the process of developing creative m aterial. 
Do not build the future on stealing from  the past and present. If generative AI can only exist through theft, perhaps we should be asking
ourselves if it should continue to exist at all.
