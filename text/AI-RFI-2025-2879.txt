General Comment
AI use by grossly incom petent figures such as those, both elected and unelected, in the Trum p adm inistration would be disastrous for
everyone involved. No good will com e of this, especially with how flawed AI still is. The vocal goals the current adm inistration has will, if
uninterrupted, have this used for m alicious purposes, do not give them  the green light.
