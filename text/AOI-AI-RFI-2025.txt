Comment on Request for Information on the 
Development of an Arti ﬁcial Intelligenc e (AI) A ction 
Plan  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the NSF and NITRD NCO’s request for 
information(RFI) on the Development of an Arti ﬁcial Intelligenc e Action Plan. 
The United States leads the world in Arti ﬁcial Intelligence dev elopment, a position 
earned through deliberate strategy rather than chance. This AI leadership stems 
directly from the vigor and innovation of American private enterprise, especially in 
software development, internet technologies, and information systems. Yet AI 
adoption is currently bottlenecked by uncertainty around organisational risk. We 
cannot accelerate growth if enterprises do not trust that they can reliably control this 
technology. The most eﬀective approach to AI security will involve private-sector 
contributions and market-driven approaches to risk mitigation . 
The inherent stochasticity of modern transformer-based architectures makes 
contemporary AI models unpredictable. In order for them to be deployed into critical 
sectors of the American economy – healthcare, infrastructure, supply chain, defence 
and manufacturing – we need the ability to understand and secure their 
implementation. Businesses are uncertain about how to measure, mitigate and govern 
the security threats posed by AI integration into their organizations. Notwithstanding 
the potential economic advantages, this issue persists as a signiﬁcant impediment to 
the di ﬀusion of AI technologies thr oughout the economy.  
To address this market failure we should foster a robust, market-driven AI 
security ecosystem – one that responds to the market’s demand for reliability, 
assurance and interpretability. Numerous vectors for market governance of AI are 
already underway. In our recent paper, we identify insurance, auditing, procurement, 
and due diligence, which address risk and uncertainty in order to unlock adoption and 
enhance national security.

Some vectors for market governance: 
This market governance of AI opens up distinct opportunities for both public and 
private involvement – strengthening national security and increasing speed of 
adoption across critical sectors.   
Insurance 
As AI systems become more complex, agentic, and autonomous, the potential for 
unintended consequences increases alongside prospective ﬁnancial losses – insurance 
gives enterprises peace of mind and the ﬁnancial security necessary to deplo y AI 
systems at scale. Insurance also functions as a powerful governance mechanism, 
shaping AI development through risk-based pricing, underwriting standards, and risk 
assessment – incentivising ﬁrms to adopt security practic es and strengthening national 
resilience. The uniquely complex risk pro ﬁles of AI syst ems – char acterized by both 
scale and high variance – create natural market conditions for novel insurance 
products. This reﬂects the insurance sect or's hist orical role in facilitating technological 
adoption through systematic risk distribution  and indemnity . 
The cyberrisk insurance sector provides a crucial precedent for AI risk management, 
demonstrating how robust insurance markets can incentivize organizations to 
strengthen their defenses and ultimately reduce societal risk. As AI becomes integrated 
into the value creation of major industries, building upon existing insurance 
infrastructure rather than creating entirely new AI-speciﬁc policies o ﬀers a practical 
pathway forward, risk evaluation may be hard but numerous initiatives are underway. 
Societal-scale AI incidents, whether accidental or from bad actors, may eventually 
prompt the development of catastrophe bond markets to transfer liability from the 
insurance sector to capital markets, providing a key backstop for societal resilience. 
Assurance 
Assurance markets services are necessary to enable trust between organisations 
providing AI services. Security services and audits, enable enterprise customers and 
consumers to trust the companies providing AI services facilitating adoption. 
Well-incentivised auditors enhance the resilience of a sector and minimise losses, 
accidents and liabilities. AI assurance markets, sometimes described as the def/acc 
ecosystem – respond to market demand for security and are increasingly part of the AI 
assurance ecosystem.

Auditing resolves the tension between system opacity and public disclosure, o ﬀering 
an intermediary solution that enables independent assessment while maintaining 
security protocols. While complete system opacity maximizes ﬁrm-level security at the 
expense of  systemic fragility, and comprehensive disclosure enhances scrutiny but risks 
exposing proprietary technology, audits provide third-party veri ﬁcation of ﬁrst-party 
claims without compr omising c ompetitive advantages. By validating AI system 
capabilities through structured evaluation frameworks, auditing creates the assurance 
necessary for wider adoption while simultaneously ensuring security standards are 
maintained.  
Procurement Standards 
The U.S. military is the world's largest customer, surpassing the total expenditures of 
most nation-states. This substantial spending is dictated by procurement standards, 
which, in turn, inﬂuence the behaviour of commer cial suppliers seeking to secure 
highly lucrative government contracts. These comprehensive standards provide crucial 
assurance mechanisms that verify product quality, security features, and operational 
reliability before acquisition, creating a powerful trust framework that enables 
conﬁdent technology adoption ev en for mission-critical applications. 
These guidelines and principles function as bottom-up market governance 
mechanisms that eﬀectively regulate industries while driving innovation and 
enhancing security postures across entire supply chains. Similarly, in the commercial 
sector, multinational corporations implement procurement protocols that signiﬁcantly 
inﬂuence supplier practices acr oss multiple domains, cultivating enhanced security 
awareness throughout global supply chain architectures. This phenomenon 
demonstrates how procurement standards transcend their conventional role as mere 
operational guidelines to become foundational trust mechanisms that enable 
conﬁdent technology adoption w hile sy stematically elevating security standards across 
entire industries. 
Conclusion 
Unlike regulation, market governance possesses the distinct advantage of embedding 
its own enforcement and incentive structures – the ﬂow of capital. Regulat ory 
initiatives for AI, on the other hand, have faced increasing criticism for being 
anticompetitive, anti-capitalist, and anti-growth – for hampering the private sector’s 
ability to innovate by imposing burdensome requirements.

A broad array of policy strategies are available towards market governance of AI – from 
complete self-governance to government mandated targets with punitive enforcement. 
From regulatory markets, where governments set strict benchmarks which 
independent entities must verify to public-private partnerships between AI security 
institutes and insurers. Remaining grounded in market forces can prove an important 
heuristic for balancing security and government control with the destabilising e ﬀects 
of large-scale AI adoption .  
By adopting a dynamic, market-centric approach to AI Governance we can enhance 
national security, accelerate technological diﬀusion and navigate the narro w corridor 
between authoritarian control and anarchy.
