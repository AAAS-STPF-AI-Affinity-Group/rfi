General Comment
I wholeheartedly believe that the widespread use of AI (especially in corporate and governm ental application) does not hold a place in the
future of the United States.
AI as a tool has proven in years that it used to steal from  the creativity and livelihood of m any Am erican artists and profits off of theft. AI
as an industry only weakens the Am erican people and econom y, and will dam age the im age and strength of the country, rather than
bolster it as the docum ent suggests. AI is an overhyped and rather weak tool that is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
