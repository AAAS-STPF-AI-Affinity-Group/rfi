General Comment
AI is reprehensible for a num ber of reasons:
* Ecological im pact is im m ense. In addition to the energy consum ption, enorm ous am ounts of freshwater resources are consum ed to cool
data centers for these AI things.
* AI is entirely dependent on theft of creators' works, both big and sm all. It produces work of no artistic m erit.
* AI steals jobs from  talented artists, coders, and alm ost everyone.
* AI is actively worsening the Internet, spreading m isinform ation everywhere. The spread of AI-generated articles with outright incorrect
inform ation is a big problem , as well as poorly-created AI sum m aries.
If anything, AI should be outlawed, or at the very least, forced only to work off of datasets gathered with inform ed consent.
