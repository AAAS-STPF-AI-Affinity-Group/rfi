General Comment
Hello, 
I don't know if m y words will be valued m uch but I still feel it im portant to voice it. Creativity is not som ething that should be taken away
from  people in the nam e of profit, m any of the m ost beautiful works in this world were born of people and ideas. 
OpenAI intends on turning all of it into fuel for an uncaring m achine that produces content rather than art. This is what copyright protection
should be used to fight, the data scraping clum ping together of the work of m illions of people who had actual passion and put in the work
to bring that passion to life, all for the sake of selling snake oil to everyone telling them  they can be an artist too with a subscription and
som e words. 
People's voices will no longer belong to them , their ART will no longer belong to them , and what little art exists will be hidden away out of
fear of the m achine taking it, dissecting it and vom iting it out for profit. For the sake of all art, for the talented people who write, sing, paint
and dream  this cannot be allowed, OpenAI and all of its brethren cannot be allowed to steal it all so som eone can boredly punch som e
lines in to receive Content and claim
it their own.
It isn't even really artificial intelligence, it's just an algorithm  using the data it scrapes to hallucinate an im age.
