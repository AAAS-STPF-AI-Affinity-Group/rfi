General Comment
The Artificial Intelligence Action Plan that this request for inform ation ( [Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan, Docket #2025-02305] ) details contains several troubling and potentially dam aging points of acquiescing to
com panies working to advance generative AI technologies like OpenAI, that could severely affect Am ericans of all fields, not just creative
ones, due to OpenAI's stated necessity to train its large language m odels on copyrighted m aterial without express perm ission. 
As an exam ple, if OpenAI and other AI com panies are allowed unfettered and unchecked access to copyrighted m aterial, this would
include not just works of art, writing, and m usic, but also things like software. Without strong regulation of this technology, nothing is
stopping anyone, including other nations from  using the excuse of "I'm  training a generative AI m odel" to claim  right to any intellectual
property, including the software of com panies like Open AI.
Also, as a technical writer that professionally works with privacy and security docum entation, I am  concerned that allowing com panies like
Open AI to train indiscrim inately opens the door to them  inadvertently storing and using sensitive personal inform ation of Am erican
individuals, opening them  up to security breaches and identity fraud if that inform ation is m ishandled or appropriated by third parties.
Please consider these points ahead of any work on the proposed action plan.
Please consider what this research im plies regarding the effectiveness of this regulation in achieving its stated purpose.
Sincerely,
