General Comment
Copyright law is not a "burden", it is a requirem ent for the future of creative and scientific developm ent in this country. Without clear
copyright laws that are respected and enforced, creators of both innovative and im aginative science and arts will go to other countries to
do their work. The brain drain as a result of stripping copyright protections to further a science that barely functions will be staggering.
This entire project is tantam ount to intellectual suicide and it should be stopped im m ediately.
