Stop building it. Literally just stop. This is deeply unacceptable. AI companies want to put us all on 
the street while they risk all of our lives in their pursuit of ASI god to let them rule the world forever. 
You must pursue an international treaty to pa use advanced AI development until we can guarantee 
with global consensus that we can make truly ethical AI. Otherwise, you are complicit in the worst 
act humanity has ever taken.
