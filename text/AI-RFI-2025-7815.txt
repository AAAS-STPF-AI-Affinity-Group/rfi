General Comment
I believe AI has been overhyped and lied about by people seeking to exploit the latest buzzwords and know they cannot deliver on their
prom ises. I also believe that giving AI the ability to train on copyrighted m aterial is pure theft and if it cannot work without stealing from
others then it is not a workable m odel.
