General Comment
AI’s very existence depends on the outright theft of others’ work and intellectual property. The obvious conclusion here is not that we
should therefore allow AI com panies to break the law. It’s that we m ust force them  to rethink and rework their system s to stop stealing. If
they cannot do that, then we do not need AI. As it is, it produces m assive quantities of garbage at enorm ous cost. We do not need to
allow this, and we shouldn’t.
