Home sleep testing and CPAP devices including BPAP and ASV should be available to patients 
with much less of a burden than current treatment protocols and insurance companies require. 
There are very few contraindications for these devices overall and AI is  nearly perfect at making 
the determination. Get with the program and streamline the procurement process with things like 
this. As a credentialed Polysomnographer I should be able to own a d operate CPAP specific 
distribution clinics and websites without h aving to grease the palms of an MD to keep the doors 
open. The oversimplification here is intended to get the discussion started. There are a lot of 
tecnologists in sleep diagnostics who could effectively saturate the population with a much 
higher l Percen tage of high quality sleep -hours if deregulation were to take place. It'd be 
comparable to the impact that legalizing marijuana had on the cartel shipping weed into the US, 
but this outcome would be realized on the medicare fraud prevention side as a well as the amount 
of resourced needed to review and approve insurance claims for PAP decices, oxygen, sleep 
testing, and other devices. You want to save medicare and social security, so here it is. With 
respect to any medical practice that treats 95% of its pa tients with the same form of treatment, 
there's no reason to bill insurance for MD assessments and expertise. I'm alluding to the fact that 
9.5 out of 10 patients who present to the sleep clinic are initially treated with CPAP. The 
paperwork generated in t hesis process as asenine.
