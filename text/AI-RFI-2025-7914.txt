General Comment
I firm ly believe that Generative im age creation ai is an absolutely negative use of technology, and resources. While AI can definitely be
used to help people in places like m edicine and certain areas of scientific research, it's use in creating im age relies on stealing the work of
copyrighted and unprotected m aterial, discourages people to m ake art for them selves, and all around is m ostly used to allow people to not
have to pay other people for their work in general. Allowing AI to freely access copyrighted and otherwise protected is purely allowing
thieves to steal the hard work of others and selling a product that will do little else but destroy our country's artists and art, while lining
their own products for doing nothing.
