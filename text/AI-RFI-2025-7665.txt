General Comment
As an academ ic and professor the m aterial private com panies want free access to isn’t free to those who create the knowledge nor is it
free to those seeking a deep understanding of it. If private com panies are allowed unfettered access to data then that access should be
unfettered for all. But to be honest m ost people to do not want generative AI. However, you know what type of AI I and others want the
USA to be at the forefront of? Catching abnorm alities in MRIs, PET, and CT scans. This type of AI doesn’t generate or hallucinate
anything. It has literally caught abnorm alities earlier than a radiologist can. Let’s have m ore of that if we insist on AI. No generative AI, no
one wants it.
