General Comment
Our entire culture and econom y is built on the assum ption that if you m ake an original creation (be it a book, painting, m ovie, invention,
etc) you own it by copyright and you have protection from  theft. Creatives toil for decades in obscurity safely that if they ever strike gold
and break through to an audience, that copyright will protect them  from  thieves swooping in and stealing your reward. If you allow AI
com panies an exem ption to copyright protection, you blow up centuries of established law that work and have prom oted innovation and
experim entation. AI is nothing but autom ated theft.
