General Comment
We should not be investing Am erican taxpayer dollars into a glorified plagiarism  engine that not only steals from  hardworking Am ericans
but also frequently gives out m isleading at best and downright false and fatal m isinform ation in search results that pollute our Internet,
further weakening our Nation in m ind and m oney.
