General Comment
STOP LETTING AI STEAL FROM HARDWORKING PROFESSIONALS ! It is deeply unethical to allow ai to use anything but
what the com pany them self produced or licensed personally with the artist / writer / professional for training. Ai com panies owe m em bers
of the creative industry untold am ounts in dam ages for what they’ve already taken. Any com pany that scraped a single piece of work
without express perm ission has com m itted theft, and should well be penalized for it, and since these com panies have done this to
thousands of people their software should be considered ineligible for com m ercial use. If you’re unwilling to side with hum an professionals
in this issue rather than big corporations, you owe it to independent creatives and everyone else who have had their hard work stolen and
fed into a m achine for profit to resign. Hum anity should not be forced to com pete with the robot software that steals people’s work for
jobs in any sector. AI poses a serious threat to creative expression, academ ics, and critical thinking, and should not be allowed to
continue developing and being sold in the current m anner on the basis of ethics. It is not in the public interest to continue such ai
developm ents, nor is it in the public interest for the governm ent to do anything else but enact strict regulations and end the use of ai in roles
that should be hum an only, such as job recruiting. Failure to do this will be rem em bered for generations and will not be forgiven.
