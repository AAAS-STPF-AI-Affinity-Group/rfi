General Comment
It has already been shown that AI developm ent has been incredibly dam aging to artists. How can we allow tech corporations to steal from
artists, writers and other working creatives to build their AI tech? Just as every other com pany m ust pay for their inputs - construction
buying wood, autom otive buying steel - if AI com panies want inputs for their m odels, they should be paying artists. Artists are hard
working people, m ost of whom  are paid very little for the work they produce. We cannot allow art to becom e a soulless endeavor that is
controlled by corporations.
