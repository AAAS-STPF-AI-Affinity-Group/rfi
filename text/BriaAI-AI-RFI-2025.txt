AMERICA 'S AI CRO SSROADS:  
Ensuring  Global Influence While Leading Innovation  
America’s global leadership  has always been built on a powerful interplay of 
military strength, economic dominance, technological innovation, and 
cultural influence. While breakthroughs in aviation, computing, and the 
internet have cemented America 's role as a technological superpower, it is 
America 's cultural exports—its films, music, media, and art —that have 
shaped global aspirations and values in a way no other nation can 
replicate.

Action Plan  
 


This soft power is uniquely enduring —it does not merely project strength, 
but shapes worldviews, fosters affinity, and instills American ideals across 
borders. People around the world don 't just watch Hollywood films or listen 
to American music —they absorb the perspectives, aspirations, and values 
embedded within them. This influence extends far beyond economic or 
military reach, fostering connections that outlast technological shifts.  
Technology can be replicated, and economic tides can turn—but cultural 
influence is far harder to displace. China can and has built  advanced AI 
models, but it cannot manufacture Hollywood 's global appeal or replicate the 
profound influence of American storytelling. As the AI era unfolds, preserving 
and protecting this cultural advantage must be a central pillar of U.S. 
policy —because the ability to shape narratives is as strategic as any military 
or technological edge.  
If America weakens copyright protections in a misguided bid to " win" the AI 
race, it risks forfeiting one of its most enduring strategic advantages. 
Copyright doesn 't hinder innovation—it preserves the intellectual and 
cultural capital that has defined America 's global influence for generations. 
Without these protections, foreign adversaries—including China —could 
freely exploit America 's creative legacy , using it to train AI models that 
reshape narratives, redefine values, and repurpose U.S. cultural influence to serve their own agendas. Instead of strengthening AI leadership, undermining copyright would hand competitors the very assets that have made America a dominant force in global storytelling, media, and ideology.  
The current policy debate presents a false dichotomy  between AI progress 
and copyright protection. In reality,  as we will demonstrate,  America 's 
leadership in AI and its leadership in storytelling are not at odds—they are 
intertwined . 
America 's creative industries are not anti- AI—they actively seek integration 
with these technologies. Media companies, studios, and creators are eager 
to participate in the AI revolution and push the boundaries of innovation,  
but through fair licensing models, not unrestricted exploitation.  By 
preserving copyright 's structure, the U.S. can accelerate responsible AI 
adoption and development while safeguarding its creative industries.  


The AI revolution must not be built on theft disguised as innovation. The 
fundamental principle that economic growth and creative rights must coexist  is the only viable long -term strategy for AI success.  
Introduction 
As a leading developer of visual generative AI models trained exclusively 
on licensed and ethically sourced content , we have pioneered an AI 
ecosystem that upholds fair compensation for content creators and rightsholders while delivering high- quality, commercially viable AI 
models.  
Bria AI, founded five years ago, has offices in New York City and Tel Aviv  and 
is backed by prominent venture capital firms. We serve the world 's leading 
marketing agencies, creative platforms, brands, and consumer goods 
companies, with media, entertainment, and gaming companies now 
increasingly adopting our models.  
Bria AI holds nine patents for its attribution technology, which connects the 
demand for generated content with the supply of authentic content for 
training —on a per- asset basis—across image, video, music, and text.  The 
company recently closed its Series B round  to expand its risk -free model 
offering  to additional content modalities, including video, music, and text.
I.Copyright: A Strategic Asset for America 's Global Influence and
Innovation
America 's greatest strength lies in its ability to shape the global narrative 
through storytelling, media, and culture. This cultural influence—rooted in 
strong copyright protections—is as essential to national security and 
economic leadership as military strength or technological innovation.  
From Hollywood films that inspire global aspirations to American music 
that sets worldwide trends, the U.S. creative industries project American 
values and interests more powerfully than any military or diplomatic 
effort.  
According to the International Intellectual Property Alliance, in 2023, core 
copyright industries were a major driver of the U.S. economy , contributing:  
•$2 trillion to GDP , accounting for 7.66% of the total economy


•11.6 million jobs, representing 5.43% of the U.S. workforce
•Trade surpluses across nearly all major global markets, reinforcing
America 's competitive edge in creative exports
These industries are not just culturally influential, they are an economic 
powerhouse, fueling growth, employment, and global trade leadership.  
If copyright protections are undermined, the U.S. risks  surrendering a key 
pillar of its economic strength, jeopardizing  $2 trillion in GDP, 11.6 million 
jobs, and its trade advantage in creative exports. Weakening copyright 
doesn 't just threaten artists and creators —it undermines a critical driver of 
national prosperity and global influence.  
Beyond its role in safeguarding creative industries,  copyright is also a 
cornerstone of American technological leadership.  While patents often 
dominate discussions on innovation,  copyright is the primary legal 
protection for software—the backbone of modern technology.  From  AI 
models to enterprise software and cloud computing , copyright underpins 
the very systems that power the digital economy. Undermining copyright protections doesn' t just weaken the creative sector —it threatens  America 's 
broader innovation ecosystem, leaving its technological advancements more vulnerable to exploitation and unauthorized use.  
II.Copyright : A Matter of N ational Security
Recent developments with Chinese AI models like DeepSeek  demonstrate
that the technological gap is rapidly narrowing . However, China still cannot
match America 's cultural influence or software innovation.
If America gives away  its creative works and software through unchecked AI 
training , foreign adversaries—including China —would be free to train AI 
models on America’s creative legacy, replicate its technological advancements, rewrite its narratives, reshape global values, and erode 
the U.S. technological edge to their advantage.  Undermining copyright 
doesn’t just weaken cultural influence —it exposes critical software 
innovations to exploitation, jeopardizing America’s leadership in the 
global technology race.  
This is not just an economic concern—it is a matter of national security . 
While the U.S. debates weakening copyright protections, other nations are fortifying their own content industries against AI exploitation. Europe’s AI 


Act is advancing strong copyright protections to ensure European creators 
and businesses are not unfairly used for AI training. Meanwhile, China has 
erected strict data barriers, limiting foreign AI companies' access to its 
cultural and technological assets while aggressively scraping global 
content —including from the U.S. —to train its own AI models.  If the U.S. 
undermines copyright, it will become an outlier, putting its own industries at a disadvantage while foreign governments shield their creative sectors and extract value from America’s.  
The U.S. creative sector is the most valuable source of training data in the 
world , making it a prime target for AI developers worldwide. From 
Hollywood and the music industry to journalism, gaming, and software, these industries are not only cultural powerhouses but also major contributors to U.S. GDP . Foreign AI developers prioritize U.S. content 
because it sets the global standard  for quality, influence, and commercial 
impact. Weakening copyright would mean unrestricted access to the world’s most sought -after training data , fueling foreign AI advancements at 
America’s expense.  
If the U.S. abandons strong copyright protections, it would effectively grant foreign adversaries—including China and Russia —unrestricted access to 
American creative and technological assets for AI training. These nations 
would be empowered to develop advanced AI models trained on U.S. intellectual property , supercharging their capabilities while undermining 
the industries that have made America a global leader in media, technology, and software.  Instead of securing a competitive edge, the U.S. 
would be handing its greatest assets to global competitors—without 
compensation or oversight.  
Other nations would not reciprocate U.S. leniency on copyright.  Instead, 
they would continue blocking American AI firms from accessing their 
content  while freely harvesting U.S. intellectual property  to strengthen 
their own AI models. This asymmetry would lead to foreign AI companies—trained on American culture and technology —outcompeting U.S. AI in the 
global market.  By failing to protect its creative and technological assets, the 
U.S. would cede its leadership in AI and digital media  to competitors who 
built their advancements on stolen American innovation.  
If AI developers are required to license content for training , it would create a 
natural barrier against foreign adversaries gaining AI power at America’s 


expense.  Licensing is discretionary , meaning U.S. content owners would 
have control over who can access their works, preventing hostile nations from 
freely using American intellectual property to build competing AI models. Currently, AI harvesting is unmonitored , allowing foreign developers to 
extract high -value U.S. creative and technological assets without oversight 
or compensation.  A licensing -driven framework would not only secure fair 
compensation for rights holders but also serve as a strategic safeguard , 
ensuring that America’s most valuable AI training data remains under U.S. 
control, rather than fueling the AI ambitions of foreign competitors.  
III.AI Leadership is About Data Quality, Not Just Scale
AI companies claim that copyright is an obstacle to progress —but this 
obscures an economic calculation rather than a technical necessity . Many 
companies understand the value of high- quality data but choose to scrape 
indiscriminately and filter afterward to avoid licensing costs. This approach is fundamentally inefficient: vast resources are devoted to cleaning and filtering 
data that could  have been properly sourced from the beginning.  
This inefficiency manifests in technical performance. Even after extensive 
filtering, poor -quality data inevitably finds its way into models, resulting in:  
•Misinformation propagation: Models trained on uncurated web data
absorb and reproduce factual inaccuracies, conspiracy theories, and
outdated information that filtering processes fail to catch.
•Privacy violations: Web -scraped datasets frequently contain personal
information that was never intended for AI training, creating risks of
exposing private data through model outputs.
•Harmful content reproduction: Despite filtering efforts, models trained
on broad internet content often reproduce toxic language, extremist
viewpoints, and harmful stereotypes.
•Persistent hallucination problems: Remnants of unverifiedinformation continue to appear in model outputs, creating reliability
concerns for enterprise applications.
•Residual bias: The biases inherent in broadly scraped internet contentoften persist in the final models despite attempts at mitigation.


By contrast, starting with properly licensed, high -quality data from reputable 
sources allows for thorough vetting, clear provenance, and appropriate 
consent. This approach not only respects creator rights but also provides a stronger foundation for building AI systems that businesses and consumers 
can trust.  
The issue is not merely technical but ethical and pragmatic: cutting corners 
on data quality to avoid licensing costs creates significant downstream 
liabilities that ultimately undermine both model performance and public 
trust.  
The "more data solves everything" approach represents outdated thinking from AI's earlier days. Modern research increasingly highlights  that 
thoughtful data curation strategies often outperform pure scale approaches for many important metrics, particularly in domains requiring 
specialized knowledge and factual precision.  
Bria AI , Adobe, Getty Images and other responsible AI developers have 
proven that models trained on licensed data deliver superior results while 
respecting creator rights.  
IV.The Flywheel Effect: Accelerating Enterprise AI Adoption and
Innovation
The greatest misconception in the A I policy debate is that licensing 
requirements slow AI progress. In reality, properly licensed AI models 
dramatically accelerate enterprise adoption, which directly fuels greater innovation:  
•Legal certainty removes adoption barriers: Media companies,publishers, and content producers cannot risk implementing AIsolutions built on unauthorized use of copyrighted works. The liabilityexposure, reputational damage, and regulatory compliance issuesprevent deployment in these sectors.
•Trust accelerates integration: Content -intensive industries—including
entertainment, journalism, publishing, and marketing —adopt AI
systems significantly faster when those systems have clear dataprovenance and licensing compliance.
•Broader adoption drives more real- world testing and feedback :
When enterprises confidently deploy AI across their operations, they


generate invaluable implementation data and use cases that drive the 
next wave of innovation.  
• Industry -specific customization accelerates: As content -intensive 
industries adopt AI more widely, they invest in specialized applications and improvements, creating innovation tailored to real business needs.  
This creates a powerful virtuous cycle:  
1. AI developers gain access to high- quality, structured training data  → 
better model accuracy and reliability  
2. Licensed AI models gain preferential access to content markets → 
faster and wider adoption  
3. Widespread adoption generates diverse implementation data  → 
informing better, more specialized AI development  
4. Innovation accelerates through real- world application → creating 
competitive advantage for responsible AI developers  
5. Content producers receive fair compensation → incentivizing 
continued creation and partnership  
Under the current extractive model, AI companies harvest value from creative industries without reinvestment , ultimately degrading the quality 
of content available for future training. This approach is not only unfair but economically short -sighted . 
Lack of transparency in AI training data creates exponential downstream 
costs that slow adoption and innovation. Without clear provenance, 
companies must devote significant resources to post -training remediation —
content moderation, filtering, guardrails, and legal reviews. Up to 50% of AI 
development resources are diverted to these defensive measures rather 
than creating new capabilities.  
Enterprises cannot fully trust or adopt systems built on unknown 
foundations. The risks of copyright infringement, privacy violations, 
misinformation propagation, and harmful content generation create substantial liability concerns that prevent widespread implementation, particularly in risk -sensitive industries. The uncertainty surrounding models 
trained on unauthorized content creates a significant barrier to adoption for risk -conscious enterprises, particularly in highly regulated industries.  
As AI becomes more central to business operations, legal clarity becomes a 
competitive advantage that speeds not only deployment and integration 
but innovation itself. Transparency and accountability in training data is 


not just an ethical requirement —it's a business necessity  that accelerates 
adoption by reducing the remediation burden and building the trust 
necessary for enterprise integration.  
Instead of AI thriving at the expense of creators, a licensing -based approach 
ensures AI and content industries grow together, maximizing both innovation and value creation across the entire economy.  
V. The Economic Double Standard: Why Are Only Creators Expected to
Contribute for Free?
Generative AI models depend on three essential inputs:  computing power, 
AI expertise, and high -quality training data. Yet, while hardware providers 
and AI firms are compensated, content creators—the very foundation of 
AI training —receive nothing.  
By 2030, the AI industry is projected to generate over $15 trillion in global 
economic value. Without a framework for creator compensation, this would constitute the largest unauthorized transfer of value in history.  
•Hardware companies and cloud providers receive billions for GPUs
and computing infrastructure.
•AI companies generate record -breaking revenues, stockholders
profit, and AI researchers and engineers command high salaries andequity stakes.
•Content creators—whose works enable AI capabilities—aresystematically excluded from this value chain.
If AI companies  truly believed that all critical AI inputs should be free, they 
would demand  free GPUs and compute power as well. Yet, they readily pay 
billions for  hardware, cloud services, and AI talent , acknowledging their 
value as essential inputs.  
At the same time, these companies  fiercely protect their own intellectual 
property, monetize AI -generated content, and insist on free access to 
copyrighted works.  This  blatant economic asymmetry —where AI firms 
demand compensation for their contributions while refusing to compensate content creators —is indefensible.  
Adding to this hypocrisy, some AI firms selectively strike licensing deals 
with major media companies while simultaneously invoking “fair use”  to 


avoid compensating other creators whose works fuel their models. This 
contradiction is not driven by legal principle but by risk management —
choosing to mitigate potential lawsuits from well- resourced media 
companies while continuing to exploit independent creators without 
consequence.  
This model is not only unsustainable but fundamentally unjust.  A thriving AI 
industry must be built on fair compensation, not selective legal 
maneuvering and unchecked value extraction.  
VI.Policy Recommendations: Strengthening Copyright to Safeguard U.S.
Leadership in AI and Creative Industries
To ensure AI innovation advances without undermining  America's 
economic, cultural, and technological leadership, policymakers must 
implement a clear framework that upholds copyright protections, promotes ethical AI development, and secures U.S. competitive advantages.  
1. Recognizing Copyright as a Strategic Asset
•Establish copyright as a pillar of U.S. global leadership andeconomic competitiveness.
•Designate cultural production as critical national infrastructure,
granting it protections equivalent to those for energy grids and defense
systems.
•Integrate copyright into national security policy , treating it as a
strategic asset in AI governance to prevent exploitation by foreign
adversaries.
•Promote international copyright standards among democratic alliesto preserve U.S. cultural influence and maintain technologicaldominance.
2. Enforcing Ethical AI Training and Licensing
•Prioritize licensed data in government procurement , ensuring
federal AI acquisitions favor models trained on properly licensedcontent.


•Develop a voluntary federal certification program  to validate AI
systems trained on ethical, licensed data —creating a market incentive
for responsible AI development.
•Fund research on efficient learning techniques that maximize AI
performance from smaller, high- quality datasets, reducing reliance on
indiscriminate web scraping.
3. Closing Legal Loopholes that Enable Uncompensated Value Extraction
•Reject broad fair -use exemptions for AI training  that allow free-
riding on copyrighted works while AI firms and infrastructure
providers are fully compensated .
•Ensure that AI -generated works trained on copyrighted content
under fair- use claims do not receive copyright protection,
maintaining consistency in intellectual property rights.
•Support voluntary licensing frameworks that create a sustainable,
market -driven economic exchange between AI developers and
content industries.
By implementing these policies, the U.S. can secure its leadership in AI 
while protecting the creative and technological assets that drive economic growth, global influence, and innovation.  
VII.Conclusion: America's AI Policy Must Sustain Both Innovation and
Cultural Leadership
America stands at a defining moment in the AI revolution —a choice that 
will determine not only technological leadership but the future of its global 
influence.  
We can allow AI development to proceed as an extractive industry  that 
cannibalizes our creative ecosystem, weakens our cultural influence, and 
ultimately delivers short -term technological gains at the expense of long -
term strategic advantages.  
Or we can establish an AI ecosystem built on ethical foundations that 
respects creator rights, delivers superior technical performance, accelerates enterprise adoption, and strengthens America's position as both a 
technological and cultural leader.  
The right choice is clear.  


Responsible AI development isn't just morally correct —it's strategically 
essential. America's global influence has always been built on both 
technological innovation and cultural leadership. By protecting copyrighted works while embracing AI advancement, we ensure that both pillars of 
American power remain strong.  
Bria AI welcomes the opportunity to collaborate on AI policies that secure 
America's leadership through innovation that respects and reinforces our 
creative industries rather than undermining them.  
Sincerely,  
Vered H oresh , Chief of Strategic AI Partnerships
