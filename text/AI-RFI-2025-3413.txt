General Comment
I believe that generative AI, if im properly and insufficiently regulated, relies on the theft and devaluation from  artists who support
Am erica's great creative outputs and industries, including film , television, and m usic. If AI firm s do not acquire the consent of data owners,
including artists, then we will greatly devalue these Am erican treasures.
