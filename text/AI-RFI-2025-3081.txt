General Comment
Hello, I do not agree with going forward with the developm ent of artificial intelligence plan. It rem oves jobs from  hardworking people and
takes away the right and identity of m any individuals. 
It is argued that so m any things could be done by a com puter, but there is a reason that it is done by a person. It gives that person a job. It
gives them  an incom e. 
By rem oving the boundaries that punish AI and the com panies that run them  for copyright infringem ent, so m any people's livelihood would
be lost. Artists and creators of all form s would no longer have a guaranteed source of incom e as their industry is overflowed with
senseless, lifeless, things and no one is able to tell the difference. 
I do not understand how anyone could think AI would ultim ately benefit anyone except the ones that m ake m oney off of it. It is a crutch
and supporting it would be against everything that I have worked for.
