General Comment
I do not believe that AI holds a future for hum anity. Giving AI free reign over everything people have built is not a good idea. Those who
steal the work of artists deserve to be held liable in every conceiveable court of law. This will give com panies legal im m unity from
copyright infringem ent. For the sake of everyone and those yet to com e, I cannot agree to this.
