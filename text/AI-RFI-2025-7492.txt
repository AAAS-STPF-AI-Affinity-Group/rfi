General Comment
Unregulated AI has already been extrem ely dam aging to copyright protection, jobs, and education. As a teacher, it is hard to overstate the
extent to which it has m ade plagiarism  and academ ic dishonesty both m ore com m onplace and harder to detect. I can see very little upside
to allowing overvalued com panies suck up vast am ounts of capital and energy to steal other peopleâ€™s work in order to pum p out
disposable slop that has little value beyond m aking it easier for teenagers to cheat at school. At the very least, AI com panies should be
strictly prevented from  using copyrighted m aterial to train their large language m odels.
