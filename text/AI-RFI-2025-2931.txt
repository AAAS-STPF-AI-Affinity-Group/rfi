Hey, what are you doing with this? Us as citizens should know what is being used and why. This sounds like anything is fair gam e. I legally
do not give you consent to just freely use m y stuff to train AI. I'm  an artist, and I've seen first hand what generative AI can do and what
dam age it can cause. You can't do that with people's inform ation!
