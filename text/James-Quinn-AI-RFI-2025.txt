As an AI practitioner for a large technology company, I strongly urge that the new AI Action 
Plan prioritize reducing non -renewable energy consumption and increasing efficiency. This is 
not just a policy action; it is a necessity for human beings' future. In my role, I see firsthand how 
AI can drive innovation and efficiency. However, the energy demands of AI are significant and 
growing. This directly impacts my workplace and community, as we strive to balance 
technological advancement with clean air and wa ter (which gas, oil, and coal -based energy 
actively harm). To address this, I propose that we remove all barriers to a rapid buildout of solar 
and wind power. Supporting this proposal, research from the International Energy Agency 
indicates that data cente rs currently account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure 
that could rise significantly without intervention. Transitioning to renewable energy and 
improving efficiency can mitigate this impact. I encourage my fellow tech workers and AI 
advo cates to join me in this call to action.
