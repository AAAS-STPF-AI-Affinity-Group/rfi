General Comment
Artificial Intelligence, which is a m arketing m isnom er for rebranding large language m odels, im age m odels, and som e form s of m achine
learning, does not work as advertised. Despite repeated and overly optim istic statem ents, AI cannot produce even m arginally consistent
results. To use the m ilitary term : it fails to m eet standards on a consistent bases. Additionally, and equally im portantly, AI m odels are built
on stealing the work of actual Am ericans so that a group of venture capitalists can try to profit off of it. Moreover, the am ount of
resources - energy, national resources like water, tim e, and m oney - that could be better used elsewhere are being diverted to chase this
technological fools good. When the AI bubble bursts, the US governm ent, m eaning the US taxpayer, should not be left holding a bag of
rotting, worthless technological feces and be on the hook for paying the tab for all the destruction the attem pt to develop AI has caused, is
causing, and will cause if this regulation is put into place. The attem pt to develop AI, especially using the current developm ental and
business m odels, present a clear and present danger to econom ic well being and national security of the United States and its citizens. AI
needs to be m ore tightly regulated, if not shut down as a the m istaken fever dream  of a group of m arketeers who want to privatize any
potential profits whole socializing the risk/dam age. This proposed regulation should not be im plem ented.
