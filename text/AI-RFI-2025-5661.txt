General Comment
AI, like any industry re-using the assets created by others under copyright law, m ust respect that law and both get perm ission from  and/or
pay creators, rather than steal that work for their own for-profit ends. It is not "burdensom e" for the AI industry to follow the law ALL
OTHER industries and individuals follow, and it is disingenuous to even suggest that it is..
