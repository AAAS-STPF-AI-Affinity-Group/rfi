General Comment
Big Tech is trying to force legalized theft down on every Am erican with this. It is predatory and wrong. Copyright infringem ent on such a
m assive scale would directly dam age countless sm all businesses and individuals for these few disgustingly irresponsible AI com panies.
They do not get to violate the law and get special treatm ent sim ply because they want to.
