General Comment
The developm ent of Artificial Intellifence is a relatively newer field that needs ethical guidelines that protect the Am erican people. AI has
already infringed on the intellectual property of thousands of Am erican creatives by training off their work with no com pensation. This not
only affects real hardworking people who wish to contribute art, writing, and m ore to society, but the inability of AI to use real thought in
its output has resulted in a flood ing of false inform ation and im agery. Regulations are needed to protect copyright laws and m ore broadly
the Am erican Dream  to work hard and earn from  your own intellectual property and skills. No entity should be above the law just to
further their business. Thank you for your consideration.
