General Comment
I am  strongly against allowing corporations to access and use copyrighted works to train AI program s. Doing so plunders the hard work
of thousands of artists and creatives, stealing their ideas in order to drive those sam e creatives out of the arts & entertainm ent m arket. It is
ethically reprehensible and only serves to m ake it easier for corporations to churn out cheap low-value products which will be disastrous
for the entertainm ent industry as well as freelance artists, and will decrease the available pool of jobs for creative workers.
