General Comment
Generative AI that is allowed to exclude itself from  copyright restrictions is not AI anym ore, it is a tool of neofascism . It is against interests
both capitalistic and otherwise. It steals from  all creative fields, and has no place whatsoever in a country that takes itself even rem otely
seriously. 
If you perm it this, you are perm itting thievery and plagiarism  as the way of the land. Facts do not m atter if Generative AI is allowed to
stand. 
And if you're thinking it will m ake m oney: Nvidia lost $600 billion dollars recently.
That was not an accident. It was a bubble deflating. It will pop, and utterly destroy the m arket and everything that latches on to it.
