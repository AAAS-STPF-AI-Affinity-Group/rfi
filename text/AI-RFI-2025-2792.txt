General Comment
AI is already a national security risk. It spreads m isinform ation, can be used to create non-consensual pornographic m aterial of m inors and
adults, and relies on the stolen m edia and content created by artists, writers, and virtually anyone who has an online presence. AI also has
drastic effects on the environm ent. As a creator, I do not want m y content or m y likeness used to train AI. I have a right to privacy as well
as the right to express m yself confidently without fear that m y work is being stolen and used by corporations without m y consent.
Copyright laws ensure that I own m y creations and that I own m y likeness. I am  a United States citizen. I am  a creator. And I am  against
the developm ent of artifical intelligence.
