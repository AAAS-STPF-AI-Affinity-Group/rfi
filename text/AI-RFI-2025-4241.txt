General Comment
I personally do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US, this is because AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and
profits off of theft.
AI fundam entally cannot work without stealing content from  hum an creators, authors, writers, artists, etc.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public to the benefit of large corporations.
