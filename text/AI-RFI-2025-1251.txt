General Comment
This is a com plete step in the wrong direction. Current AI developm ent is based on the wholesale theft of intellectual property, all to
create a technology that is extrem ely unreliable and cannot be counted on to accom plish even the m ost m enial of tasks. Repealing the
Biden adm inistration's restrictions will place undue burden on the individuals and com panies within the United States who actually created
the intellectual property being stolen for AI developm ent. This m easure will rob intellectual property holders of m oney they are owed for
the use of their intellectual property.
Further, there are serious security concerns about the utilization of AI by the federal governm ent. AI is prone to fabricating "inform ation"
and "evidence" wholesale, with no basis in reality. It is wholly incapable of accom plishing the tasks that federal workers are able to
accom plish, and im plem enting it in governm ent will only serve to waste m ore taxpayer m oney and render the federal governm ent
inefficient.
The correct thing to do is to strengthen restrictions and regulations on AI developm ent, not loosen them  as loosening restrictions will only
harm  Am erican citizens and businesses.
