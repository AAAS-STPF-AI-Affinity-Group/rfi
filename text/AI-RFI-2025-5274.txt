General Comment
I am  writing to oppose any change in regulation that would favor AI developm ent, or investm ent.
AI is a fairly blatant scam , and investing in it, or allowing it to flagrantly ignore intellectual property laws, represents an incredible m isuse of
public funds and resources. AI is a financial disaster, and appears to be effectively the next thing in the line of NFT's, and other speculative
currency scam s that serve only to m ove vast sum s of wealth around by deceiving both investors and the general public.
