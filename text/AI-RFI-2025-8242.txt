General Comment
This "plan" is a bad idea that'll lead to a less safe Am erica. Allowing everyone's data to be stolen for this AI is a privacy concern and the
generative tools it provides can be used to spread all sorts of falsehoods. Plus, it'd be an infringem ent of our rights as Am erican citizens to
not be able to sue if any intellectual property is stolen
