General Comment
Ai in this current form  is unacceptable. It's creation requires: destroying everything we believe about ownership of our own creations,
m aking people do the worst m ost soul crushing job possible of categorizing m ass am ounts of data, using m ass am ount of energy and
resources which contributes to clim ate change. And what do we gain out of it? A m achine capable of averaging m ass am ounts of data to
m ake som ething fam iliar to all the data fed to it. 
How can this be worth the im m ense cost of its creation? What does this do positively for good actors? Bad actors love it as it let's them
do a variety of horrible things. Som e exam ples: non-consensually creating pictures of people, potentially with fewer clothes than they
prefer to be publicly wearing. Firing artists of all types from  all professions and replacing them  with som ething that kinda vaguely seem s
like it creates sim ilar work when it will in actuality never create som ething unique or valuable. Create and execute scam s with believable
pictures of people or bots that act like people.
We can not support "progress" like this, it is sim ply another scam  just like web 3.0, bitcoin, nfts. It just has m any m ore horrible uses that
giant corporations and scam m ers love. Am erica is supposed to be about individuality, so let's not support the bit of software that averages
and flattens m ass am ounts of people and their work. Choose hum anity.
