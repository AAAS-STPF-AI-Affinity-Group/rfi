General Comment
As a hobby artist who wishes to m ake a career with m y art in the future, I wish to let the word be known that this proposed regulation is
nothing m ore than destructive and insulting towards creative Am erican citizens. To allow these corporations to freely train their AI
program s to copy what artists do for a constructive and inspiring living is nothing short of underm ining the potential of great storytellers
within the entertainm ent industry, corporate and independent. Generative AI is sim ply a sm oke-and-m irrors schem e to steal from  creators
of visual art, anim ation, m usic, cinem a, video gam es, print, television, and beyond, in order to cheapen the m any facets of m edia our nation
absorbs on a daily basis. If generative AI is allowed free reign by corporations to com m it blatant theft for the sake of lining their pockets
with additional and, m ight I add, undeserved profit, I can prom ise you the public, including m yself, will push back, or fight back, against
this decision, should it com e to pass.
Generative AI has zero m oral or legal standing within Am erica or any country in the world. I say no to any and all form  of AI in the
context of learning and producing.
