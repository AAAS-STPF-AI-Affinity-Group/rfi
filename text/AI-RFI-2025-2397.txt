General Comment
I believe AI should not be allowed to use/be trained with copyrighted im ages, and any im ages on people’s social m edia accounts,
especially those that are private accounts. Generative AI im ages pose a large threat to individuals’ reputations and safety. For instance,
explicit content can be generated that features a person who has never, and would never, take such photos of his/herself. (Minors in grade
school have already faced this problem ; it is not only theoretical anym ore.)
I also think AI should not be allowed to use any copyrighted m aterial for its training: writings, m usic, etc. AI is a threat to all creatives
currently. When this technology was on the rise, m any people said that no artists or other creatives would lose their jobs because of it;
however, that has been undoubtably proven wrong within the last two or three years. AI is attem pting to autom ate the arts, which are such
an im portant part of hum an life, when we could instead use this technology to autom ate m undane tasks, and tasks that no one wants to do.
