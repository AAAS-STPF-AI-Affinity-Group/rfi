General Comment
As som eone who relies on photographs of real anim als for work and keeping people safe, I do not want AI generated im ages to flood
internet im age searches in a way that obscures real photographs. I need to be able to identify anim als through m inute details and
environm ental data and I do not want the identification process to be filled with detrim ental falsified inform ation.
