Subject: AI Action Plan – Advancing AI Education for K -12 and Higher Education Dear OSTP and 
NITRD NCO: My name is Raza Ali, and I am writing to emphasize the importance of integrating AI 
education across both K -12 and higher education in a way that streng thens American innovation 
while ensuring students develop critical thinking and problem -solving skills. AI is already reshaping 
industries, and if the United States is to maintain its leadership in this field, our education system 
must prepare students not  only to use AI tools effectively but also to understand their limitations, 
biases, and broader societal impact. As a student in the higher education system, I have seen how 
AI-powered tools can enhance learning and research in profound ways. However, as A I tools 
become more sophisticated, there is a growing concern that over -reliance on them could hinder 
students’ ability to think independently and solve problems creatively. To prevent this, the AI Action 
Plan should include policies that ensure AI educati on enhances —rather than replaces —critical 
thinking skills at all levels of learning. I propose the following: 1. AI Literacy Across All Grade Levels 
K-12 and higher education institutions should integrate AI education into their curricula, not just as 
a technical subject for computer science students but as a fundamental skill for all learners. This 
should include: • K -12: Basic AI concepts introduced early, focusing on responsible AI usage, 
understanding AI -generated content, and recognizing bias in machin e learning models. • Higher 
Education: More advanced AI literacy, including hands -on applications in research, industry, and 
ethical considerations of AI deployment. 2. AI as a Tool for Learning, Not a Substitute for Thinking AI 
should be integrated into e ducation as a complement to human intelligence, not as a crutch that 
diminishes analytical skills. AI -powered learning tools should: • Provide students with data -driven 
insights while requiring them to interpret, analyze, and verify AI -generated outputs. •  Encourage 
problem-solving exercises where students use AI to assist in brainstorming or research but must 
ultimately produce their own conclusions and arguments. • Teach students to critically evaluate AI 
responses rather than accepting them at face value , ensuring they develop the ability to fact -check 
and challenge AI -generated content. 3. Teacher and Faculty Training in AI Integration Educators at 
both K-12 and higher education institutions need professional development opportunities to 
effectively inco rporate AI into their teaching methods. Training programs should focus on: • Helping 
teachers balance AI use with traditional learning methods. • Encouraging faculty in higher 
education to integrate AI into research and coursework while maintaining academi c integrity. • 
Providing clear guidelines on when and how AI tools should be used in assessments and 
assignments to avoid over -reliance. 4. Ethical AI Education and Awareness With the rapid 
deployment of AI, it is critical that students at all levels under stand AI ethics, including issues of 
privacy, bias, and accountability. Policies should: • Require AI ethics courses as part of both K -12 
and higher education curricula. • Teach students to recognize and mitigate biases in AI models, 
ensuring that AI devel opment is equitable and inclusive. • Promote discussions on AI’s societal 
impacts, particularly in fields such as healthcare, criminal justice, and labor markets. By taking 
these steps, the United States can ensure that AI is used to enhance learning and r esearch without 
undermining the intellectual skills that drive true innovation. If the AI Action Plan focuses solely on 
advancing AI technology without equipping students with the critical thinking skills needed to 
engage with it meaningfully, we risk crea ting a workforce that depends on AI rather than one that 
leads it. I strongly urge the administration to prioritize AI education policies that empower students 


to harness AI as a tool for discovery, innovation, and critical analysis. By ensuring that AI education 
is both widespread and intellectually rigorous, we can prepare the next generation to lead in AI 
development rather than merely follow its advancements.  Thank you for considering my 
perspective. I look forward to seeing policies that support both AI literacy and the cultivation of 
independent thought across all levels of education with this administration’s support. Sincerely, 
Raza Ali
