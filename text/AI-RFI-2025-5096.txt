General Comment
AI steals from  m y livelihood as a working Am erican citizen and profits off of theft in ways that have been overlooked by the courts.
If any other private party were to consum e protected m aterial owned by another person or business and reproduced it for their own
profit, that would be stealing.
The source m aterial is not being transform ed for different use, itâ€™s actually being used in the sam e form  as it was originally created and
owned.
