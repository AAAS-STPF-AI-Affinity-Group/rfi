General Comment
Do not let OpenAI steal from  other artists and profit off work they did not create. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the
US. AI steals from  artistâ€™s livelihoods and profits off theft from  other Am ericans. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican
public - and destroying the environm ent.
