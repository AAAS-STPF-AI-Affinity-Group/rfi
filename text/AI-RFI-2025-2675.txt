General Comment
AI has no place in the future of Am erica, and I am  sick and tired of Open AI and Google thinking that just because they have a lot of
m oney they can jsut buy their way into control of everything. AI trained off stolen artwork is im m oral and should absolutely be illegal,
especially since the 5 pay who all have enough m arket shares in OpenAI to get rich from  it won't ever care about what this will take from
us. This is take our privacy, our right to our own words and ideas online. I hope that you, whoever is putting this bill into action, are fully
prepared to hand that right over to the corporations if you plan to go through with this, which you should not be. I can't im agine whatever
children you have being too happy with you, knowing that they'll never know a m om ent's peace on the internet. Please, for all our sakes,
for m ine and yours, please please please don't allow this bill through!
