General Comment
The restrictions put in place by the prior adm inistration were m ade to protect us, and by rem oving those restrictions the governm ent seeks
to rem ove our negative rights and allow others to invade our right to privacy. The right to privacy has been protected by the 9th
Am endm ent since the founding of our governm ent, and the training data that AI com panies are trying to use is protected by it.
Additionally, the Constitution also protects our copyrights, which AI com pletely ignores. Please, keep restrictions on AI so that our rights
m ay be protected.
