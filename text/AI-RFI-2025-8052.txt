General Comment
Please do not give AI focused com panies carte blanche to steal from  the public without consent from  those that create. You do so, you
strangle creativity in Am erica. 
AI can replace hum anity in ways that are conducive towards hum anity's growth and the cessation of suffering. Replacing the hum an aspect
in art and creativity with AI regurgitations will not do any such.
