Hello. My name is Devin Marshall, and I strongly disagree with this plan and urge you to
reconsider.
AI is a dangerous path that promises us the world on a silver platter, but is actually going to
lead to the downfall of our country. It steals from the labor of artists and artisans, repurposeswith no empathy or consideration, and gives incorrect information that people absorb as law.
The more that we rely on such empty promises, the more we leave ourselves vulnerable to
manipulation and misinformation, and also lose out on the work of the creative minds thatmake our country so great and provide so much of the work that AI steals from.
I urge you to instead work on robust copyright laws with regard to AI use, so that we may
remain protected in terms of our intellectual property, labor, and ideas. Only then should wefeel secure in relying so much on artifical intelligence instead of biological intelligence.
