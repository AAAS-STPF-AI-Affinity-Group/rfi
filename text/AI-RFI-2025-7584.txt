and other creatives. They constantly present false or otherwise harm ful inform ation as the truth endangering every day Am ericans. The
technology is dangerously easy to abuse to spread false inform ation about real world health, safety or political situations. In addition AI
Technology consum es m assive am ounts of energy, water and natural resources endangering local infrastructure and the environm ent writ
