General Comment
AI should not and does not hold a sustainable place in the United States. It is a plagiarism  tool that isn’t accurate nor reliable. It’s also an
energy suck and us, everyday people, are the ones that have less access to basic infrastructure and electricity in our hom es and
com m unities. It will also take needed jobs from  hum ans. The Am erican governm ent needs to prioritize hum an capital, not a chatbot that
has stolen hum an intelligence, art, research, and scholarship.
