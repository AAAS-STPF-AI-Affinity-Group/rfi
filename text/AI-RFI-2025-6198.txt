General Comment
Stealing another's work without perm ission is copyright infringem ent, thief in fact, no m atter the m ethod. This will have no teeth, and the
lawsuits and litigation will still com e, by bending around precedent until the thief loses anyway. Save yourself the trouble and kill this bill.
