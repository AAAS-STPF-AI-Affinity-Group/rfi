General Comment
The system  currently being advertised as "artificial intelligence" is little m ore than aggregation of statistical data. This system  does not know
or understand any of what it outputs, and it certainly does not know how to think. This is not an "artificial intelligence" system , but a system
blatantly based around the theft and distribution of content created without the consent or copyright of the people actually responsible for
the works that is fed into it. These regulations m ust not be lifted, as they are a flagrant m isuse of the assets of hard-working people the
world over, including the Am erican people, who frown on this system  and everything that it stands for. The only people who stand to gain
from  the rem oval of these regulations are the people who have stake in it, people who have lied their way to the top by claim ing that theft
is legal if they have the m oney behind them  to m ake it so. Uphold these regulations, and let us distance ourselves as a nation from  these
crim inals claim ing to be entrepreneurs.
