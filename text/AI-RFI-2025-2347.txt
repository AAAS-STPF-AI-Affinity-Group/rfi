General Comment
Please do not go through with this. AI as we know it is not actually anything intelligent, it is m erely pattern recognition and com bination on
a large scale, built off of works it had no rights to train on. Jobs are at stake because com panies would rather use com posites of stolen
work than anything original thinking they can save a few bucks when in reality it only further harm s their brand. 
You claim  this is for dom inance but you cannot dom inate in a field where nothing is actually original or yours. Nothing that LLMs provide
is original or able to be protected.
