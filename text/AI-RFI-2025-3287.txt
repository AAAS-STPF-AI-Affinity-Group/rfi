General Comment
We do not need AI training their m odels on data they do not have perm ission to use. Please do not ruin the lives of artists, creators,
designers, m usicians and so m any other jobs and peoples way of life. How unethical and horrible is it to STEAL from  others and create
som ething that looks like it. Exactly. A m achine shouldnâ€™t be doing it either. We need careful and thoughtful AI laws to protect THE
PEOPLE.
