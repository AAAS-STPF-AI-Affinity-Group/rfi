General Comment
As a content creator, I should have the absolute right to license m y copyright work to AI com panies for a price that I determ ine is fair.
Any regulation that attacks that right is an affront to the Am erican system  of free enterprise. Copyright is established in the Constitution.
Telling creators that their property rights can be taken away for the good of som e other party is the sort of com m unistic nonsense I would
expect from  the Dem ocrats, not a Republican adm inistration.
