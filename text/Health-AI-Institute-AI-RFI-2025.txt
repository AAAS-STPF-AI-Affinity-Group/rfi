 
   Subject: Public Comment on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  
To Whom It May Concern,  
On behalf of the Health AI Institute , we appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the 
development of a national Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan . As a leader in AI -driven 
healthcare innovation, research, and implementation, we support a strategic and responsible 
approach to AI governance that maximizes benefits while safeguarding patient safety, equity, 
and transparency.  
1. Prioritizing AI Governance and Risk Management  
We recommend the AI Action Plan emphasize robust governance frameworks  that align with 
the principles of transparency, accountability, and fairness  in healthcare AI deployment. 
Specifically, we urge the federal government to:  
• Establish clear regulatory guidelines  on AI validation and performance monitoring in 
clinical settings.  
• Promote standardized AI risk assessment frameworks , including bias detection, 
explainability, and ethical considerations.  
• Require human oversight mechanisms  in AI-assisted decision -making to prevent 
overreliance on automated outputs.  
2. Strengthening AI in Healthcare through Interoperability and Data Standards  
To accelerate AI innovation and adoption in healthcare, the AI Action Plan  must address 
barriers related to data interoperability and access  while maintaining stringent data privacy 
protections. We encourage:  
• Development of federated learning models  that allow AI training across institutions 
while preserving data privacy.  
• National data sharing standards  to enhance AI model generalizability while ensuring 
security and compliance with HIPAA.  
• Collaboration with health IT vendors and EHR systems  to integrate AI solutions that 
enhance clinical workflow efficiency.  
• Support for community engagement initiatives  that involve diverse stakeholders in AI 
system design and evaluation.  
3. Ensuring AI Transparency and Public Trust  
Public trust in AI -driven healthcare depends on transparency in AI development and 
deployment . We urge federal agencies to:  
• Require AI developers to disclose model limitations, validation data sources, and 
explainability metrics . 


 
   • Establish public AI registries  for high-risk AI applications in healthcare to ensure 
accountability.  
• Mandate rigorous post -market surveillance  of AI tools used in medical decision -
making. 
4. AI Workforce Development and Ethical AI Education  
A comprehensive AI Action Plan should include workforce training initiatives  to equip 
healthcare professionals with AI literacy and implementation skills. We recommend:  
• Federal grants to support AI training programs for clinicians, data scientists, and 
health IT professionals  and AI think tanks . 
• Ethical AI education programs integrated into medical and informatics training 
curricula . 
• Development of interdisciplinary AI ethics boards  to oversee responsible AI 
deployment in healthcare.  
Conclusion  
The Health AI Institute  supports a balanced approach  to AI regulation and innovation that 
prioritizes patient safety, equity, and transparency  while fostering technological 
advancement . We welcome continued engagement with federal agencies to shape a forward -
looking AI strategy that aligns with the needs of healthcare providers, researchers, and patients.  
We appreciate your consideration of these recommendations and look forward to further 
collaboration.  
Sincerely,
