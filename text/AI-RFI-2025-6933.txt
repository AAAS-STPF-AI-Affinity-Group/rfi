General Comment
I and countless other Am ericans im plore you - DO NOT DO THIS. SHUT THIS DOWN NOW. GenerativeAI has no place in our
future as it exists now. It flies in the face of every hum an being and only exists to steal & poorly regurgitate ideas of actual people.
Allowing OpenAI unfettered access to the creations of actual hum ans, allowing it to bypass copyright will have far-reaching &
catastrophic consequences for us all. Meanwhile it will continue to funnel wealth into the pockets of a handful of ghouls. There HAS to be
a boundary. Stop this NOW!
