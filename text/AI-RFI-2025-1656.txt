General Comment
Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and m anaged with
com m ensurate care and resources. Unfortunately, this level of planning and m anagem ent is not happening, even though recent m onths have
seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever m ore powerful digital m inds that no one – not even their
creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.
