General Comment
Under no circum stances should the right to private property be infringed by AI com panies, developers, or anyone else. Generative AI
can, and has for years, continue developm ent on public and free inform ation only. In addition, there is no need for artist AI or author AI.
The only real utilities for AI are as inform ers to or assistants to hum ans. AI "art" is not real art, and if we allow the proliferation of it, we
will eventually reach a point where the AI is learning from  other fake pieces of both art and literature to produce new content. This will
inevitably lead to m ajor decline in the quality of our cultural corpus and the threat of cultural regression.
