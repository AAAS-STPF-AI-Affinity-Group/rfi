There are a lot of restrictions that limit the applications of Health AIs. For example, medical 
advice is a regulated area. Regulations like this stifle the potential for AIs. A good compromise would be more specific regulations, where low risk areas have lower amounts of restrictions, which would allow for Health AIs to increase the value they provide to consumers.
