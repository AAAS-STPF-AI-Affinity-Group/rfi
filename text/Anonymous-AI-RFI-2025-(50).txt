Justification :
Using platform data for AI training without explicit consent violates user autonomy and
undermines public trust. Dark patterns, which manipulate users into sharing data, exacerbate
this issue by exploiting behavioral psychology. By enforcing strict penalties and requiringtransparency, we can ensure that tech companies prioritize user rights over profits.
2. Ethical Use of Social Media Data
Problem Statement :
Social media platforms collect vast amounts of personal data, often without users fully
understanding how it will be used. This data is frequently used to train AI models, leading toprivacy violations and biased outcomes.
Proposal :
●Ethical Guidelines for Data Usage : Establish clear ethical guidelines prohibiting the
use of social media data for AI training without explicit consent androbust
anonymization .
●Open Source Audits : The datasets used to train AI models should be open source ,
allowing independent auditors to verify that they were obtained ethically and with proper
consent.
●Public Accountability : Companies should be required to publish annual transparency
reports detailing how user data is used, including any AI training activities.
Justification :
The misuse of social media data for AI training undermines privacy andfairness , eroding
public trust in both tech companies and AI technologies. By enforcing ethical guidelines andrequiring open source audits , we can ensure that AI development aligns with societal values
and respects user rights.
