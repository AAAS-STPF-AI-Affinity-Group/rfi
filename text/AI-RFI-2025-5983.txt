General Comment
AI is the death knell for hum an freedom  and creativity. AI should not be given access to products of hum an creation for training because
this will lead to plagiarism , and already has. AI spreads m isinform ation and hallucinated sources. I’m  a professor and already seeing the
ugly effects in m y students’ writing. We need to stop this and if possible reverse it.
