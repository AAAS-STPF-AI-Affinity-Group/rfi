General Comment
No com pany should be allowed special perm issions to use the data of citizens for AI training. Let them  go through the current legal
fram ework if they want it.
In any case, AI is all hype, esp when it com es to LLMs generating text and im ages. The potential for invasion of privacy with tbis action is
m uch higher than the possible threats this action could defend us against.
