General Comment
Large Language Models cannot create original work on their own. They are program s that can only produce a statistically m ost likely next
word or pixel based on the training data fed to them  and they require a trem endous am ount of data to work. Allowing for com panies and
organizations producing LLMs to freely appropriate any and all data that they can to train them  without com pensation to the people who
m ade the work is an anathem a to the free m arket and should not be allowed.
