General Comment
If I have to pay to use an AI m odel, which you do for m ost of them , the AI m odel com panies should have to pay for the content they train
their AI on.
However. There is absolutely no reason AI should be trained on copywritten m aterials. There is plenty of non-copywritten m aterials, such
as m edia that has entered public dom ain, that they can use.
My writing, m y art, m y copywritten work should NEVER be used to train AI without m y express written perm ission.
