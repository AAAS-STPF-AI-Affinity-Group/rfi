General Comment
It is disgusting to allow a singular Com pany to override all copyright infringem ent on people's own personal works. AI steals from  actual
hum ans creations and is a horrible thing for the states. 
AI breeds laziness from  com panies to hire actual workers that are passionate about their job in place of som e ugly garbage that nobody
likes. AI content is overhyped and being pushed by businesses purely because they invested in it. Nobody thats an actual hum an enjoys
this. 
Shut this garbage down now.
