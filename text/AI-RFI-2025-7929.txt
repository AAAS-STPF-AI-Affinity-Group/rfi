General Comment
Allowing AI developm ent to disregard copyright and legally steal other people's intellectual property is theft. It will im m easurably harm  the
open internet, as anyone with anything worth protecting will have to stop sharing their inform ation and art with the world, lest it be stolen.
Any future legislation to redress these harm s will be closing the barn door after the horses are gone. Citizen data privacy and property
protections are sham efully weak already; we need to strengthen them , not rem ove them  entirely.
