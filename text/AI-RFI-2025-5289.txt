General Comment
Breaking our laws because other countries m ight break our laws is the downfall of our legal system . We cannot allow this breach of
copyright law just because another country m ight do so. This takes away our autonom y and m akes us stoop to the lowest com m on
denom inator. With this we let our com petitors set term s instead of doing things the right way, our way.
