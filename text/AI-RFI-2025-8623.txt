General Comment
Using AI to strip artists of their intellectual properties without their consent is theft. I canâ€™t take a m ovie and copy it to m y own website
without being exposed to litigation. Artists should be paid for their work and given the opportunity to continue working and creating.
Allowing an AI com pany to steal their work with no recom pense or recourse is appalling.
