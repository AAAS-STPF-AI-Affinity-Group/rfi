General Comment
I oppose the presidential action "Rem oving Barriers to Am erican Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," and I am  calling for a review of
artificial intelligence under current copyright law. 
As a visual artist, m edia producer, and science journalist, I have no incentive to innovate if I have no ownership of m y work. The 15 years
I have spent developing m y body of work will m ean nothing if som eone scrapes that inform ation to train an AI and pad their own
portfolio.
Open AI released ChatGPT to the public nearly two and a half years ago. In that tim e, we as a society have received plenty of evidence
that the AI industry is under im m ense pressure to deliver a return to investors. As a response, com panies have released products that fail
to deliver on their prom ises of accuracy and reliability. Google's "AI Overview" and Gem ini often return false or dangerous inform ation.
Generated news articles and im ages flood the internet without any kind of AI label or fact checking. And even at this early stage, the
resources it takes to run AI dam age our already strained energy grids and ecosystem s. 
It's tim e to acknowledge that AI is not a cure-all, is not built for widespread use, and needs m ore tim e in the oven. During that tim e, we
need to build a code of ethics that allows Am erica to continue to be a destination for artists and creators. We m ust also hold com panies
accountable for AI-generated m isinform ation.
