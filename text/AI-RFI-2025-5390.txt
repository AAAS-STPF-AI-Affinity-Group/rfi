General Comment
AI m ust not be allowed to steal, or “train” on works unowned by the AI com pany. Allowing such an act only hurts the Am erican and will
create m ore distrust than there already is in the ability of our governm ent. They will steal our art, our voices, our faces, anything you think
to be yours can and will be stolen. Do not let them  take this from  us and do not let them  take it from  you.
