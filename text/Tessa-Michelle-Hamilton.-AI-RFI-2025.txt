My name is Tessa Michelle Hamilton.
My comment:"I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US and AI steals from my livelihood as
an American and profits off of theft. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Americanpublic; it is a speculatively valued product peddled by people with interests in their ownmarket value and not vested in the good of the American people. This is not an appropriateway for us to be spending our time/tax dollars/resources on."
