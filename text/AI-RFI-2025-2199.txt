General Comment
Speaking out for m yself and other creatives: AI is the worst. AI program s are the equivalent of a dem o or Alpha level program . They
don't work! If they really worked, hum an input and correction would be m inim al. Instead, it's increased workloads. Not only that, the only
thing AI can do well is steal data. That's all it does is steal and sm ash all that info together badly. 
AI is anti-Am erican! It is anti-freedom ! If a com pany has to steal to m ake m oney they are nothing but fraudsters, scam m ers, and
charlatans! They steal what was m ade by the hands of real, living, breathing Am ericans, and sell it back with their own nam e on it. Lazy is
what I call it. These AI com panies don't want to work like the rest of us! If we cannot m ake a living off our own labor, without m achines
stealing what we've m ade, this country is not a free country.
