General Comment
AI has and continues to hurt creatives in all industries. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. It will continue to put
Am ericans out of jobs and steal from  m y livelihood and m any others, profiting off of theft. AI is a scam  that is being oversold and over-
hyped to the Am erican people.
