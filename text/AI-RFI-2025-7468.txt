General Comment
AI steals from  Am erican livelihoods and profits off of theft.
AI is overhyped slop and is fleecing the Am erican public.
AI could have had lim ited, judicious use in certain applications, but instead has been unethically slopped across everything to the point
where we are drowning in it, we are sick of it.
