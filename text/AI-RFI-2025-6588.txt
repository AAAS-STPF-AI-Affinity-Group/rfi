General Comment
Under no circum stance should the wholesale theft of the intellectual property of Am erican artists in the nam e of fueling a privatized
plagiarism  m achine be allowed.
Artificial Intelligence should not be given an autom atic pass to ignore the rights autom atically given to creators. Creators, artists, authors,
m usicians and all other artists should retain control of their original works, especially when corporations are poised to profit im m ensely
from  these works.
