General Comment
Artificial Intelligence system s m ust not be allowed to be trained on copyrighted m aterial without perm ission and licensing of the
creators/owners of that m aterial. The nature of LLMs dictates that they can and will generate exact duplicates of the training data, which is
a copyright violation. Most of the training data for these m odels was taken without perm ission or any kinds of licensing, which is unfair and
threatens the incom es of the people who created the m aterial to begin with. All training data m ust be explicitly opt-in and all rights holders
need to be paid for their work, or this is no better than piracy on a grand scale, which is already against the law.
