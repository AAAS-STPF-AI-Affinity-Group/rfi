General Comment
As som eone who values m y privacy and also values the integrity of m y own works and m y own rights, AI agencies having the ability to be
im m une to lawsuits and being allowed to scrape from  anything is a m assive safety risk and is also som ething I'm  not consenting to in the
slightest. Additionally, stuff like this will allow for people to create deepfakes of anything from  porn of children to incorrect governm ent
statem ents from  officials. It is a threat to both national security and citizens, and will not be used for anything good at all.
