General Comment
I am  a university m athem atics instructor. As an educator, it is im portant to m e to be able to share publicly content that I create for m y
courses so that it can reach a broader audience. At the sam e tim e, I rely on copyright protection to retain rights and control over m aterials
that I create. My understanding of the proposed regulation is that AI com panies would be essentially exem pt from  following copyright law,
and free to use anything I m ake publicly available to train AI m odels. If im plem ented, it would have a chilling effect on m e and anyone else
who wishes to m ake m aterial of any kind that they have written available to the public. I would have to seriously reconsider what I can put
on the public internet lest it be scraped by AI trainers, and would likely need to keep m y course m aterials restricted to university servers
that only m y own students can log into.
I also do visual art as a hobby, and enjoy sharing m y art online for the sheer joy of sharing it with others. I would also be m uch less able to
do this if m y art were m ore vulnerable to AI scraping. Every other artist I have discussed this issue with feels sim ilarly, so I would also
expect to be less able to enjoy others’ art.
In sum , this regulation flies in the face of the principles of copyright and the rights of creators, and im plem enting it would seriously harm
everyone’s ability to share m aterial (whether written or visual) in public.
