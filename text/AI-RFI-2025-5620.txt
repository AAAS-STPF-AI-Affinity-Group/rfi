General Comment
As a creator and avid enjoyer of the arts, I believe that allowing AI com panies to ignore copyright law is a detrim ent to everyone. This
would actively discourage any kind of sharing of inform ation or innovation, as openAI would be allowed to steal it and m ake low quality
knock offs. Additionally this would allow any individual or com pany to access vast am ounts of copyrighted work, save it, then shield
them selves with the excuse that they are training an AI and are exem pt from  copyright. This would harm  m any people and stifle m ore
econom ic growth that the country desperately needs.
