General Comment
Generative AI is theft, stealing from  hum an creators, m ost often without their consent. Most accurately, it is a scam  trying to pass as
hum an work when it can never be. It often creates m ore work for hum ans with the fallibility of its creations and requires diligence to
ensure accuracy. AI cannot be trusted as it lacks a hum an’s discretion and ability to say “I don’t know the answer to that.” With all that
being said, generative AI does not deserve special exem ptions from  the law and should be heavily m onitored and never given free rein of
data.
