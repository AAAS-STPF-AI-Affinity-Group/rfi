Hello,
I am an illustrator and author, and I do not support companies training their generative AI models off of copyrighted
images and data without the consent of the copyright holder. This will hurt other industries within our economy,including the small independent artists who already walk a fine line financially, whose work is so often taken totrain these models. So many of these artists are pursing what so many of us think of as the American Dream -starting from nothing and building a trusted business. If we don’t protect their work from generative AI, we willsacrifice their careers and lose the chance to experience many of their works. We will lose so much of the art andculture that shapes America. I don’t believe that’s a worthwhile trade.
Please do not allow generative AI to be trained off of copyrighted works. We can’t cannibalize other industries to
support this one. We can’t replace human creativity with machine code. Not only does it go against the values wehold as a nation, but I don’t believe it will serve us in the long term morally or materially.
Thank you for reading,
-Maria Frantz
