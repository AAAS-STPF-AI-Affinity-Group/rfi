General Comment
Generative AI is nothing m ore than an overpriced crutch to enable the laziest and dum best m em bers of society. It is a drain on our
collective intelligence, and ability to think critically. The powers that be, who are seeking to enact this m easure, m ay have been sold on the
con, but all evidence thus far has dem onstrated this entire enterprise is little m ore than a bottom less financial crater, where only the
prancing salesm an presenting the proverbial snake oil stands to benefit, confident in the knowledge that it is not he who shall be
accountable in the end. This request should be whole heartedly rejected.
