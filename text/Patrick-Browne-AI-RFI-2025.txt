I am the Associate Director for the Global AI Frontier Lab at NYU. International cooperation 
and exchange for AI research is crucial, as demonstrated by many critical international 
cooperative discoveries throughout recent history. In an increasingly isola tionist international 
landscape, it is imperative that the United States continues to recognize comparative scientific 
strengths throughout the world, and utilize our alliances and global partnerships to bolster our 
scientific ecosystems and enhance our AI  capabilities. The wealth of potential applications for 
the nascent AI field will only benefit from a broad set of perspectives and inputs, and 
international partnership and exchange among U.S. research institutions has a proven track 
record for success.
