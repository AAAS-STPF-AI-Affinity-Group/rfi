General Comment
I am  a US citizen and a podcast host and voice artist. This m eans that hundreds of hours of m y voice are available online for people to
listen to. I am  happy to put m y voice on the internet for people to listen to and enjoy, but I worry that AI com panies m ay want to use m y
voice for training generative AI software without m y perm ission. It's becom ing very com m on to have AI com panies use opt-out language
for AI training, which I always do, but once m y voice recordings have been downloaded and used to train AI software, there is no
recourse available. I worry that these com panies m ay want to break the rules and then ask forgiveness later. I would hope that the US, in
its m ission to ensure AI dom inance, would not allow these com panies, m any of whom  have foreign investors and business interests, to use
Am erican voices, writing, art, or photography to train their software without express perm ission. Cheating to achieve dom inance in the AI
field is not only un-Am erican, it puts a dark m ark on all of the AI produced here. Thank you.
