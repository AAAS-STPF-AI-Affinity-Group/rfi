Greetings,
As an American citizen, I have found that AI is grossly overhyped with its work, and that it is one big scam
designed to destroy resources for the country. It profits from hard work of our people that it steals from withoutpaying back, and any funds put into it vanish into the pockets of its creators without seeing any returns. This“technology” has no place in American spending.
