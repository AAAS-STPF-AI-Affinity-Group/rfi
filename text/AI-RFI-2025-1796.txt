General Comment
I understand the need for AI developm ent as an em erging technology that will alter the geo-political and econom ic landscapes going
forward, but I also see how dangerous this technology is going to be if handled by reckless leadership. AI cannot be allowed to take over
roles for Hum ans too quickly or too invasively, doing so, or even showing the possibility that that will happen, will only serve to further
destabilize the Am erican econom y when tariffs are already m aking people cautious. The possibility of people losing their jobs because
Am erican leadership is so focused on efficiency that they don't give regard to the consequences of m ass lay offs and the concerns of the
people... it will sim ply cause m ore hesitation, m ore econom ic downturn before that reality even gets here. This is som ething that needs to
be addressed with caution and tact, both qualities that are lacking in the current adm inistration. So I feel com pelled to give com m ent as
well, please take steps to protect people's jobs, focus AI efforts on defense and security where it can be em ployed to protect the country.
