General Comment
I am  NOT in support of this action. I stand with any and all copyright holders, whose rights would be violated by this action.
Generative AI isn’t “intelligence.” It is studying and copying the patterns it’s trained on, so it’s not the fault of AI. Copyright infringem ent is
the fault of the developers who train their technology on copyrighted m aterials. We need to be lim iting this m ovem ent, not giving them
m ore. We can develop and advance this technology without relying on giving the developers furthered and unfiltered access. 
If the technology is artificially intelligent, why m ust it dem and m ore from  us? We need to find a way where it can exist peacefully with us,
rather than parasitically.
