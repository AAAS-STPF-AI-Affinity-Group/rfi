General Comment
AI is not the future, it is sim ply a way to steal the work of authors, artists, and creators of all kinds. Copyright is a vital elem ent of
Am erican industry, and allowing AI com panies to unilaterally bypass it will cause enorm ous dam age to the Am erican econom y. I do not
wish to surrender the rights to m y labors to any AI com pany, that is only interested in stealing from  hardworking Am ericans. Do not allow
these Silicon Valley salesm en to destroy the livelihood of m illions of Am ericans who contribute to the beautiful artistic legacy of this great
country.
