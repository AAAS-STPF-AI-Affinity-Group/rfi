General Comment
AI is theft. It cannot be trained without using copyrighted m aterial, the com panies m aking these m odels have no path to profit. By allowing
this you are devaluing all copyrighted m aterial. It is environm entally catastrophic, these ghouls have nothing. You want to take away
regulation from  an already barely regulated industry that will never turn a profit.
