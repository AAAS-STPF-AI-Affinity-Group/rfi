AI without rigid protections is a liability, not an asset. In this entirely unregulated space, it is a 
breeding ground for extreme energy consumption, entire industries being wiped out, the 
devolution of art, intellectual property theft, likenesses being used without consent, and the creation of false narratives to a criminal degree. This is clearly being done at the behest of the largest companies in the space, and what these corporate AI backers fail to realize is what data they can steal to enhance their  AI’s can be stolen right back. There would be no enforceable 
ownership over anything, no ability for an average citizen to combat likeness, voice, or data theft without fighting these massive corporations in a scorched earth legal battle. Which is why it is the government’s absolute responsibility to regulate a space so clearly steeped in corruption. There is no two ways about it. Any and all AI data must be provided with the explicit consent of any intellectual property holders, or performers. People are entitled to their talents and skills, I along with everyone else deserves the autonomy to choose where their skills and talents can be applied, it is no different than deciding whether I choose to use my voice to become a voice actor, or my analytical mind  to become an accountant. Nobody has the right to steal my talent or 
skillset I cultivated to line the pockets of corporations running a race in the next grift since NFT’s fizzled out. If the United States government chooses not to take the threat of AI se riously, 
AI will not just harm the citizens of this country the government is sworn to protect, but also the corporate masters of industry pushing for this nonsense in ways they are too short sighted to comprehend.
