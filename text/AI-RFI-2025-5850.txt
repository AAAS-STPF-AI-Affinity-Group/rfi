General Comment
Generative AI is unethical, im m oral, and will lead to num erous problem s if allowed to continue to steal intellectual property. It will allow
OpenAI and sim ilar organizations to steal content from  hard working Am ericans in order to elim inate huge num bers of jobs, spiking
unem ploym ent and flooding m arkets with inferior, and potentially dangerous products. It will disincentivize m ore and m ore Am ericans
from  being able to develop productive skills and cause critical thinking to atrophy. This will inevitably lead to brain drain as high quality,
professional workers will be harder and harder to com e by in Am erica, and the United States will slowly but surely slip into irrelevance
and obscurity in technical and creative fields.

It is a technology fraught with danger that robs and pillages everyday Am ericans in order to generate useless nonsense that is only correct
by sheer coincidence. For all of our sakes, the United States should abandon AI or at least severely restrict what AI organizations are
able to pilfer without consent or com pensation.
