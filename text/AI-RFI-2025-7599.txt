General Comment
Please don't give any AI com panies any copyright exem ption. They should ask for perm ission just like everyone else should when using
som eone else's work directly. It takes all the hardworking artists, writers, and m usicians effort away from  them  without any paym ent of
sorts. They don't need this.
