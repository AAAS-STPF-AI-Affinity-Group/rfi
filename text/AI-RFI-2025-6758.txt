General Comment
Generative AI is content theft and should be heavily regulated in its application, with the content creators used in training m odels
com pensated and credited. It should not be subsidized by the federal governm ent and private com panies like Open AI, Xâ€™s Grok,
Midjourney, and others should be subject to fines for their inappropriate use.
