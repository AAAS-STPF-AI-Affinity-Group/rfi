General Comment
As an inspiring artist and general supporter of the arts and artists, protect us. Not AI. AI has been built off the back of m illions of of artist
with our knowledge, concent, or care all while stealing jobs, spreading m isinform ation, and destroying m ultiple industries.
Now AI com panies want to take away the *one* thing protecting us and allowing yo fight this m assive theft fair use and copyright. If AI
can not exist with out stealing from  everyone and everything, it doesn't deserve to exist in the first place. 
Setting aside the theft and job instability inherent to generative AI... it's just a m isinform ation nightm are. With out regulation or checks ai
will turn into a beast that will consum e every inch of the internet until nothing can be none for sure. Not egg prices, not travel routes, not
stock prices or projections. AI is already spreading m isinform ation and lies about the world and if allowed to continue, that will all pur
lives are t built by. 
Allowing AI to change copyright and fair use and to develop woth checks will create a dangerous precedent for all tech and com pnaies. I
do NOT want to live in a world where tech com panies can take whatever they want, do whatever they choose with it, and ignore the
wishes of those responsible for providing them  with their creation. 
AI is theft. AI is violating m illions of US citizens rights and proections. And AI m ust NOT be allowed to continue.
