General Comment
We need to uphold united states copyright law. There is no reason the artificial intelligence industry should be able to bypass established
copyright system s for the sake of their profit. They have already stated that they wouldn't be able to operate without theft - the answer
isn't to let them  steal. If you can't operate a business without breaking the law, then so be it.
Allowing artificial intelligence com panies to bypass copyright law will kill creative industries, as they directly interfere with freelancers,
professionals, studios, and other creative firm s.
