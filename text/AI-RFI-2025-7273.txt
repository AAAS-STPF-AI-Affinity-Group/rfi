General Comment
Generative AI (genAI) creates no value and is a technology built on theft and illegal use. It is a technology built with the sole purposes of
scam m ing or creating illicit deepfake im agery (such as generating revenge porn), and has no real uses outside of causing harm . The
datasets are scraped from  the copyrighted works of artists, from  leaked m edical records, from  every single photo ever uploaded (every
selfie, every fam ily photo, every instance of gore or porn that has been uploaded to the internet, including illegal content). These datasets
are created from  im ages that the com panies who shill these worthless products never had perm ission to use and often never SHOULD
have used. genAI should never be at the forefront. Techbros should not be rewarded for their failures to be a part of hum anity. They
should never be rewarded for having subjected their fellow m an to this glaringly obvious issue of privacy, safety, and labor rights.
