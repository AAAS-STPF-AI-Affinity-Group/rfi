As a PreK -12 school  leader,  researcher,  and instructor  of the leadership  track  for the 
Introduction  to Teaching  with  AI course  at the University  of Pennsylvania  Graduate  School  of 
Education,  I have  guided  school  and district  leaders,  superintendents,  and ed-tech  innovators 
as they  navigate  AI’s promise  and risks.  At The Forest  School:  An Acton  Academy  and The 
Forest  School  Online,  we have  integrated  AI into  teaching,  learning,  and operations  for the 
past  seven  years.  This  work  has revealed  both  AI’s transformative  potential  and the 
safeguards  needed  to use it wisely.  AI, like most  any innovation,  is neither  inherently  good  nor 
bad—it is shaped by its application. Its impact depends on how it is used. Artiﬁcial 
intelligence  (AI) is no exception.  It can expand  opportunity,  personalize  learning,  and 
streamline  operations.  It can also  erode  human  relationships,  reinforce  bias,  and diminish  the 
role  of educators.  The challenge  before  us is not whether  to use AI but how  to ensure  it serves 
education  rather  than  undermines  it. In aviation,  the shift  from  piston  engines  to jet engines 
required  a complete  rethinking  of infrastructure,  air traffic  control,  and safety  protocols.  AI 
requires  the same  level  of thoughtful  planning  in education.  It is not just another  tool —it is a 
paradigm  shift.  The question  is not whether  AI will change  education,  but how  we will shape 
that  change  for good  while  avoiding  its dangers.  At The Forest  School,  we have  seen  ﬁrsthand 
how  AI can enhance  learning.  Adaptive  platforms  like Khan  Academy,  Zearn  Math,  Duolingo, 
Lexia  Core  5, and Amira  Learning  have  personalized  instruction,  allowing  students  to progress 
at their own pace. AI -driven career counseling through YouScience has helped students 
identify strengths and career paths aligned with their skills. AI -assisted scheduling and 
operations  have  given  educators  more  time  to mentor  students  rather  than  manage  logistics. 
These tools, when implemented intentionally, have increased student engagement, 
achievement, and efficiency. But AI’s risks are real. Without clear ethical guidelines, it can 
reinforce  bias,  create  over -reliance  on machine -generated  content,  and erode  critical  thinking 
skills.  We have  worked  to counter  these  risks  by ensuring  students  not only  use AI but 
understand  how  it works.  Middle  school  students  at The Forest  School  participated  in an AI 
Quest,  where  they  explored  AI’s strengths  and weaknesses,  wrote  AI-generated  e-books, 
examined AI biases, and engaged in ethical debates. This approach ensured AI was used as a 
tool  for empowerment,  not automation.  The key to AI’s responsible  use lies in policy,  training, 
and oversight. AI should support, not replace, educators. It should enhance human 
relationships,  not undermine  them. AI  policies  should  be co -created  with  students,  teachers, 
and families  to ensure alignment  with  educational  values.  AI’s impact  on equity  must  be 
actively  monitored,  preventing  wealthier  schools  from  gaining  AI-driven  advantages  while 
under -resourced schools receive a lesser version of education. Finally, AI must remain a 
complement to authentic learning experiences, not a shortcut that removes struggle, 
creativity,  or deep  thinking.  Technology  is neutral,  but its consequences  are not.  AI offers 
unprecedented  opportunities  to personalize  learning,  expand  access,  and support  educators. 
It also  presents  risks  that,  if ignored,  could  weaken  the very  foundations  of education.  The 
challenge  ahead  is not to embrace  or reject  AI but to use it wisely,  ethically,  and in service  of 
human  ﬂourishing.  If we do, AI will not replace  the best  of education —it will make  it better.

Key Points  
 At The Forest  School,  AI has been  integrated  since  its inception  to teach  both AI  development  
and usage,  preparing  learners  for future  challenges.  
 The integration  of AI in education  is not just a trend  but a fundamental  shift, akin  to the 
transition  from  piston -engine  to jet-engine  aircraft,  requiring careful consideration and 
ongoing reflection.

A buddy  of mine,  Paul,  works  for a major  airline  headquartered  in Atlanta.  The airline  
deploys  him to examine  new  technologies.  He assesses  whether  integrating  them  will 
improve  plane  ﬂights  and,  if so, what  the ripple  eﬀects  are. Money,  time, and lives  are at 
stake.  What  a responsibility!  
As an education  leader,  I feel a similar  responsibility  regarding  new  technology, though  the 
stakes  are diﬀerent.  Money  and time,  yes, but also morale,  safety,  and relevance.  
These  days,  a massive  tech  integration  question  for teachers  and school  leaders  is— What’s  
the right  use of artiﬁcial  intelligence  (AI) in education?  
My colleagues  and I at The Forest  School:  An Acton  Academ y and The Forest  School  Online  
have  integrated  AI since  our inception  seven  years  ago.  We believe understanding  AI’s inner  
workings  and using  AI are both  important.  By teaching  AI

development  to select  learners  and AI usage  to all, we prepare  our learners  for the f
The greatest  takeaway  for us hasn’t  been  ﬁnding  helpful  tools.  A bit of R&D testing  in 
classrooms  with  pilot  users  reveals  whether  the tools  positively  impact learning  and are 
perceived  as eﬀortless  by stakeholders.  Rather,  our exploration  of AI has  been  much  more  
meta  than  that.  It’s more  fundamental,  more  paradigm  shifting.  
My buddy  Paul  explains  that  the shift  from  piston -engine  to jet-engine  aircraft  in the 1940s  
and 1950s  required  one of the most  comprehensive  changes  in airport infrastructure, air 
traﬃc control systems, and international aviation regulations. It also  led to the 
development  of new  safety  standards  and innovations  in aircraft design  and engineering.  
It shifted  the aviation  landscape  for the better.  
How  should  AI shift  the current  paradigm  for teaching  and learning?  And how shouldn’t it?  
I teach  the leadership  track  of the Intro  to Teaching  with  AI course  at the University of 
Pennsylvania  Graduate  School  of Education  (our  application  window  closes  at the end of July 
2024).  In that  program,  we wrestle  with  fundamental  AI questions, explore  emerging  tools,  
walk  through  the unique  components  of a school  model where  AI could  play  a part,  
consider  ripple  eﬀects  on the infrastructure  of learning, and  appreciate  the risks.  We 
wonder  about  and plan  for a new  division  of labor  for teaching  and learning —what’s  AI’s job 
vs the teacher’s  vs the student’s  vs the parents and caregivers?  Like with  any big change,  we 
riﬀ on how  to invite  stakeholders  to adjust  to AI and eventually  row in the same  direction.  
As an example,  my team  and I walked  through  13 unique  components  of a school model  
and made  (for now)  the following  moves:  
1.Vision
We asked —How  can AI help  us achieve  our school’s  vision  more  eﬀectively?  
How  we answered —Our school  mission  is each  person  who  enters  our doors  will ﬁnd a 
calling  that  will change  the world.  For us, AI is like any other  new  tech.  It can be used  for 
good  or ill. Thus,  we’ve  sought  and embraced  AI to the extent  it helps  us guide  stakeholders  
to reify  their  life’s  purpose.  Anything  short  of that bar doesn’t  get our attention for long.

 2. Curriculum  
We asked —How  can AI customize  and adapt  our curriculum  to meet  the diverse needs 
of our learners?  
How we answered —We landed on responsive and adaptive learning programs like Khan 
Academy, Zearn Math, DuoLingo, Lexia Core 5, and Amira Learning (the world’s ﬁrst AI teacher 
of reading). The latter tool didn’t replace 1 -on-1 or small group reading  instruction,  but it 
increased  our capacity  10x to facilitate  personalized reading practice. Since then, 100% of 
our diverse community of learners experienced  reading gains of one year or more. Overall, 
the AI learning programs are far from perfect. But they’ve allowed many students to learn 
deeply and at their own pace.  
When  ChatGPT  launched,  I led our middle  school  in an “AI Quest.”  For six weeks  we played  
with  new  AI tools  and riﬀed  on possibilities.  For a ﬁnal Exhibition,  the middle schoolers  wowed  
parents,  caregivers,  and visitors  by writing  e-books  with  visuals, responding  to emails,  
synthesizing  research,  discussing  AI ethics,  and more.  The adults  were  blown  away.  
 
3. Pedagogy  
We asked —How can AI enhance our instructional methods and support personalized learning?  
How  we answered —Three  methods  arose  for us. First,  self directed  learning.  We’ve always  
been  about  learner -led education.  But adding  AI tools  to peer -to-peer  learning  and trial  and 
error  meant  our learners  were  even  more  empowered  to take  charge  of their  learning.  
Second,  we embraced  AI-driven  career  counseling  with  YouScience . 
Enhanced  with  AI, YouScience  analyzes  learners’  skills,  interests,  and aptitudes  to suggest  
potential  career  paths  and colleges  that align  with  their  unique  proﬁles.  One hundred  percent  
of our middle  and high  schoolers  now  use it. Third,  we enhanced learner  support  systems  
through  tools  like speech -to-text,  language  translation,  and personalized tutoring.  
 
4. Assessment

https://www.gettingsmart.com/2024/08/19/ai -in-education -leading-a-paradigm-shift/ 5/14  
We asked —How  can AI-driven  analytics  provide  deeper  insights  into learner performa
How  we answered —Three  methods  arose  for us here  as well.  First,  we leveraged  the learning  
analytics  embedded  in the responsive  and adaptive  learning  programs mentioned  above.  
They  analyze  student  performance  data  to identify  strengths, weaknesses,  and interests,  
helping  guide  learners  toward  discovering  their  passions and  potential  callings.  Second,  we 
had our middle  and high  schoolers  take  the College  and Career  Readiness  Assessment  Plus.  
This world -class  test uses  AI to assess learners’ quantitative reasoning, analytical thinking, 
writing eﬀectiveness, and writing  persuasiveness.  Third,  we brought  back  a form  of oral 
exams  (which  we call Practicals)  to ensure  authenticity  in assessments.  Essentially,  learners  
can use AI at various  points  throughout  their  learning  journey,  but ultimately,  they  must  
prove mastery  of foundational  learning  objectives  in foolproof  ways —i.e., both  with  and 
without AI tools.  
5.Schedules  and Routines
We asked —How  can AI optimize  our schedules  and routines  to create  a more eﬃcient 
learning environment?  
How  we answered —There  are loads  of possibilities  on this front.  We’ve  used  various AI tools  
for dynamic  grouping,  educator  allocation,  automated  scheduling,  task prioritization,  
traﬃc  ﬂow analysis,  and more.  Asking  AI to brainstorm  use cases helps.  
6.Roles,  Development,  and Management  Model
We asked —How  can AI streamline  administrative  tasks  and support  data -driven decision -
making for staﬀ?  
How  we answered —AI has played  a role in job posting,  creating  and synthesizing performance  
reviews,  and professional  learning.  Now,  we look  for candidates  with experience  using  AI in 
teaching  and learning.  On the job, we provide  professional development  for staﬀ  to practice  
doing  so. We guide  educators  through  prompt -

making  exercises.  We’ve  made  our own  bots  to aid internal  planning  and reﬂection pr
7.Community  Practices  and School  Culture
We asked —How  can AI foster  a more  inclusive  and connected  school  community?  
How  we answered —To get everyone  on the same  page,  we appointed  a small  team  to facilitate  
our educators,  learners,  parents,  and caregivers  across  our organization  to authorize  guiding  
principles  for AI use.  The resulting  principles  reveal  a dual commitment  to encouraging  AI use 
while  maintaining  a commitment  to authentic, collaborative, iterative, and deep disciplinary 
learning.  
8.Bridges  and Partnerships
We asked —How can AI facilitate stronger partnerships with external organizations and 
stakeholders?  
How  we answered —We’re  actively  searching  for partnerships  to help  us with enduring  IP 
and privacy  wonderings.  We’re  not alone  in needing  help  here.  Given recent  failures  in the 
sector  (like  the recent  one in Los Angeles ), there’s  nervousness around partnerships.  
9.Tech  and Tech  Infrastructure
We asked —What  technological  infrastructure  do we need  to support  AI integration eﬀectively?  
How  we answered —Over  the last seven  years,  we’ve  purchased  20+ subscriptions  to AI-
driven programs.  
10.Continuous  Learning  and Improvement  Mechanisms
We asked —How  can AI support  continuous  professional  development  for our staﬀ?

https://www.gettingsmart.com/2024/08/19/ai -in-education -leading-a-paradigm-shift/ 7/14  
How  we answered —To inform  decision  making,  we’ve  used  AI bots  to synthesize inter
external stakeholder feedback, helping identify themes across stakeholder groups.  
11.Space  and Facilities
We asked —How  can AI enhance  the use of our physical  space  and facilities  for better learning 
outcomes?  
How  we answered —AI use demands  dynamic  space  management  and personalized learning  
environments.  Recently  we conducted  this research  about  catering  our space to 
individual learning styles and needs.  
12.Budget,  Operations,  and Logistics
We asked —How  can AI optimize  our budget,  operations,  and logistics  for greater eﬃciency?  
How  we answered —We’ve  streamlined  some  routine  administrative  tasks  like updating  
learner  support  documents  and personalized  learning  plans),  allowing  our team  to focus  
more  on guiding  learners  and communicating  with  parents.  Also,  we amped  up data -
driven  decision  making  (e.g.,  AI-driven  predictive  analytics  to anticipate  resource  needs  
and manage  budget  allocations)  to make  better  decisions based on data.  
13.Communications
We asked —How  can AI improve  our communication  with  parents,  students,  and staﬀ?  
How  we answered —Emails,  emails,  emails.  Web  copy.  Newsletters.  Job postings. Social 
media. Graphics. Did I mention emails?  
In sum,  AI has helped  our schools  by: providing  personalized  and interactive learning  
experiences,  tailoring  educational  content  to cater  to diﬀerent  intelligences, scaﬀolding  
support  that  adjusts  to learners’  current  abilities,  increasing

administrative  eﬃciencies,  and aiding  our team’s  progression  from  teaching  to guiding
Integrating  AI has potential  pitfalls.  It can increase  screen  time,  make  cheating  more 
attractive, diminish human -centered relationships, and increase tech company inﬂuence in 
schools. Prioritizing eﬃciency might incentivize learner laziness, undermining  productive  
struggle  and creativity.  It could  exacerbate  educational inequalities  between  better  and 
lesser  resourced  schools.  Environmental  impacts from  tech  infrastructure  needed  for AI add 
further  challenges.  To mitigate  these issues,  some  combination  of promoting  balanced  AI 
usage,  facilitating  bona  ﬁde learning  and evaluation  processes,  enhancing  human  
connections,  and focusing  on equity and eco -friendly practices makes sense.  
Despite  possible  drawbacks,  an exciting  wondering  has been —What  if AI was a tipping  
point  helping  us ﬁnally  move  away  from  a standardized,  grade -locked, ranking -forced,  
batched -processing  learning  model  based  on the make  believe  idea of “the average  man ” 
to a learning  model  that  meets  every  child  where  they  are at and helps them grow from 
there?  
I get that  change  is indescribably  hard  and there  are risks.  But the integration  of AI in 
education  isn’t  a trend.  It’s a paradigm  shift  that  requires  careful  consideration, ongoing  
reﬂection,  and a commitment  to one’s  core  values.  AI presents  us with  an opportunity —
possibly  an unprecedented  one—to transform  teaching  and learning, making  it more  
personalized,  eﬃcient,  and impactful.  How  might  we seize  the opportunity boldly?
