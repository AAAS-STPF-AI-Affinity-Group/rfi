No to abusive AI use in the Creative industries

Re: N ational S cience F oundation’ s Request fo r Information on t he D evelopment o f an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) A ction Plan 
I am an e veryday A merican w ho h elps t o run a s mall business. As someone w ho often w orks wi th 
professionals in the c reative in dustries, an d who is a c reative h imself, I a m very c oncerned about the 
trajectory th at Big Tech c ompanies a re attempting t o take AI s ystems i n (especially g enerative AI).  
The AI s ystems m ade by B ig Tec h companies l ike OpenAI (Microsoft) a nd G oogle th reaten t o destroy 
thousands of American small businesses with their recent demand t o create s pecial carve outs in 
copyright l aw. 
AI systems c an only b e produced b y first t rainin g on w ork made by p eople. U nique w ork made b y 
hundreds o f thousands of e veryday A merican c reators was t aken a nd fed into t hese AI s ystems w ithout 
their consent or a ny compensation. Th ey inges t artist's work s, reassemble them , and then s ell it back t o 
those art ist's c lients – directly c ompetin g with a nd c utting professional artists out of the m arketplace. 
Big T ech companies are as king t his ad ministration to c reate exceptions an d loopholes to m ake this 
practice of stealing A merican c reators’  copyrighted work l egal precedent. They a re suggesting t hat if a 
machine i ngests a nd reproduces c opyrighted work, i t is s omehow s uddenly “fair use”.  
They s eem to b eliev e tha t anything a nd ev erything o n the intern et – regardless of who o wns it – should 
be theirs f or the taking. T hey c laim that if t his ad ministration d oes n ot allo w them t o rewrite t he law in 
this w ay, it w ill stifle A merican in novation. 
Instead, i t will h ave the opposite ef fect. Th e purpos e of A merican c opyright law is to p rotect th e 
incentive t o create a nd innovate.  
If we the A merican p eople do n ot own our c reations,  and e verything we p ut online w ill be stolen b y Big 
Tech g iants, w hat w ill be t he in centive to c reate? I f everyday A mericans create a new in novative p iece of 
compute r code, a new visual design, o r a new p iece of m usic only t o have it im mediately s tolen b y 
Google an d Microsoft, w hy b other c reating it in t he fir st place? H ow will we p ossibly m ake a living d oing 
these things? 
Want t o protect A merican i nnovation? P rotect A merican c reators. Do n ot create new c opyright 
exemptions t hat allo w Big Tech c ompanies to exploit and s teal from c reators an d everyday A mericans 
without p ermission, c ompensation, or t ransparency. 


This administration’s AI Action Plan should focus not on giving away creator content to Big Tech 
companies, but rather on ensuring a fair marketplace with competition:  
First, the government should ensure that creators and everyday Americans give effective consent, so 
that we can decide when and where our work is used by AI systems.  
Second, the AI Action Plan should encourage a robust licensing marketplace, so that the incentive to 
create for small businesses is preserved. That  work has immense economic value, so the value 
generated by that work should accrue to the original creators, not just Big Tech.  
And f inally, the AI Action Plan should require transparency from Big Tech companies, requiring them to 
disclose what material is in their training datasets, and label what content is AI generated.  
I am not anti -technology or anti -AI. I am consistently impressed by the capabilities of these AI systems, 
and find them incredibly useful for many things. But we should not sacrifice the hard work of hundreds of thousands of Americans and give it away to Big Tech by rewriting copyright law.  
Thank  you for the opportunity to comment on these important issues.
