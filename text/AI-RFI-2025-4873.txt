General Comment
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. The purpose of it is to line CEO pockets by cutting creative budgets
to dust and to placate US citizens by tricking them  into thinking theyâ€™re creating som ething, to think they have agency in a world run by
oligarchs who only view them  as laborers for their technocracy.
