General Comment
Generative AI does not have a place in the future of the US, actively harm s US production and soft power efforts, is instrum ental to the
bankrupting of m assive swathes of capital already, and is necessarily not self sufficient, profitable, nor effective at alm ost any task it is put
to, that does not im m ediately becom e inundated with fallibilities, vulnerabilities, liabilities, and plain old lost m oney. 
It's a speculative bubble long past when the relevant authorities should have stepped in to heavily regulated it, and exact financial
repercussions for open, unabashed, and system ic fraud. 
The longer generative AI rem ains as it is, the weaker the US becom es. 
The m ost foolish policy decision from  the perspective of any authority concerning national security, not invested financially in AI, would be
to legalize further fraud and theft.
This adm inistration m ust m ake bold action to restrain this industry, which already is in freefall
