3.0 IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP : A STRATEGIC FOUNDATION FOR AI POLICY ACTIONS  
Before executing AI policy actions, we strongly recommend  the NITRD program begin with a structured 
implementation roadmap. This roadmap will serve as a strategic framework to ensure that AI policies are 
coordinated, actionable, and adaptable to the evolving AI landscape. A well -defined roadmap will provide clear 
priorities, funding strategies, and governance structures, enabling responsible AI adoption while maintaining U.S. leadership in AI innovation. More specifically, we recommend that the Implementation Roadmap include the 
following 10 components. Details about  each component is presented below. 
1.Establishing a National AI Ethics and Governance Structure
2.Prioritizing Funding for AI Research & Privacy-Preserving AI
3.Developing National AI Privacy and Security Guidelines
4.Investing in AI Education and Workforce Development
5. Establishing a National AI Innovation Fund & Promote Open-Source AI6. Developing Standardized AI Testing and Explainability Benchmarks7. Incentivizing Responsible AI Adoption in the Private Sector8. Creating an AI Risk Assessment and Governance Framework9. Funding AI Pilot Programs in High- Impact Sectors
10. Strengthening AI Cybersecurity for National Security
A critical first step in this roadmap is the establishment of national AI ethics and governance structure (1). 
This includes creating a National AI Ethics Board, composed of experts from diverse fields, to oversee AI development, establish ethical guidelines, and advise on modifications to existing policies and identifying the need for new policies . Additionally, a Multi-Stakeholder AI Forum should be launched to ensure continuous 
collaboration between industry, academia, civil society, and government, allowing AI policies to remain adaptive to emerging challenges and advancements. 
To maintain U.S. leadership in AI research and development (R&D), the federal government must prioritize 
funding for AI research and privacy -preserving AI  (2) through agencies such as NSF, the Defense Advanced 
Research Project Agency ( DARPA), and the National Institutes of Health ( NIH). Investments should focus on 
explainable AI (XAI), privacy-preserving AI techniques (e.g., federated learning, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption), and AI safety mechanisms that defend against adversarial attacks and bias. Increased funding in these areas will enhance AI transparency, security, and public trust while enabling ethical AI integration across sectors. 
Additionally, national AI privacy and security guidelines (3) must be developed to protect sensitive data and 
mitigate AI -related cybersecurity threats. The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST) could take 
the lead in establishing adaptable security protocols, ensuring AI systems meet best practices for data collection, storage, usage, sharing, disposal, and security. These privacy and security guidelines must also address AI-specific cyber risks, such as model inversion, data poisoning attacks, and adversarial manipulations, creating a standardized security baseline for industry and government adoption. 


As AI continues to reshape the job market, the U.S. must invest in AI education and workforce development  
(4). AI literacy should be integrated into K-12 education, as well as an expansion of AI -focused degree 
programs in universities and community colleges. A national AI workforce retraining initiative should provide 
scholarships, apprenticeships, and industry partnerships to prepare workers for AI-driven automation. These efforts will ensure that the U.S. maintains a strong, competitive, and diverse AI workforce that is prepared to 
drive innovation. 
To encourage AI-driven innovation, the federal government should establish a National AI Innovation Fund 
(5)and promote open-source AI development. This fund would support AI applications with clear societal
benefits, while also fostering public- private AI research collaborations. Open -source AI should be encouraged
through grants, competitions, and the development of a national AI model repository, increasing transparency,and responsible AI adoption across industries.
Ensuring standardized AI testing and explainability benchmarks  (6) is another essential component of the 
roadmap. NIST, in collaboration with the National AI Ethics Board, should establish AI evaluation standards to 
ensure models are transparent, interpretable, and aligned with fairness and reliability metrics. Standardi zed AI 
testing will provide the necessary safeguards for AI deployment in critical industries such as healthcare, finance, and national security, fostering trust in AI systems and promoting responsible implementation.  
To further drive ethical AI adoption, incentivizing responsible AI development in the private sector (7) is 
crucial. The federal government should offer tax credits, grants, or regulatory relief to organizations that demonstrate adherence to ethical AI guidelines, use explainable AI techniques, and prioritize data privacy and security. These incentives will help align AI industry growth with national policy objectives, ensuring that AI 
advances responsibly while mitigating potential risks. 
A structured AI risk assessment and governance framework  (8) must also be developed to manage potential 
AI-related risks. A national AI risk classification framework should be created to evaluate bias, security 
vulnerabilities, and prevent economic disruptions stemming from AI technologies. Adaptive AI regulations 
should be introduced to balance innovation and governance, ensuring AI applications remain safe, transparent, and beneficial to society.  
To ensure AI policies translate into effective real -world applications, funding AI pilot programs across high-
impact sectors (9) is essential. Examples of high- impact sectors include healthcare, finance, transportation, and 
criminal justice where pilot pro grams will help gather real-world data on AI deployment challenges, best 
practices, and long- term impacts. These pilot programs will serve as a bridge between AI research and practical 
deployment, ensuring AI adoption is informed, responsible, and scalable. 
Lastly, AI -driven cybersecurity  (10) must be prioritized as critical to  national security. Federal agencies such 
as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) , the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects 
Activity (IARPA), and the National Security Administration (NSA) should invest in AI- powered cybersecurity 
tools that detect and counter AI-driven cyber threats while strengthening AI-enhanced intelligence-sharing 
mechanisms across government agencies. As AI -powered cyber threats continue to evolve, proactive investment 
in AI-driven defense systems is critical to protecting U.S. infrastructure and digital assets.  
Implementing this AI Action Plan roadmap will provide clear policy direction and funding priorities, ensuring that AI initiatives align with national objectives related to security, workforce development, and technological innovation. By fostering collaboration across government agencies, industry leaders, and academic institutions, this structured approach will accelerate the responsible deployment of AI technologies while maintaining ethical standards and risk mitigation strategies. Through a phased and s trategic implementation  process, the 


NITRD program and its federal  partners can reinforce U.S. leadership in AI innovation, strengthen AI 
governance frameworks, and support sustainable, equitable, and forward-thinking AI development.
