General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. If anything, the US needs to BAN AI, as it steals from  the livelihoods of
Am erican innovators and profits off the thefts. AI cannot do the kinds of things that its proponents assertâ€”it can collate, but NOT create.
It is actively harm ful to the kind of innovative advances upon which Am erica has long prided itself.
