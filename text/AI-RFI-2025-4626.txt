General Comment
AI can't even tell the difference between cancer research and public waste. It doesn't even know how m any r's are in the word
strawberry. It should be controlled before it does m ore dam age to the governm ent than it currently is. And surely it should be held
accountable for the errors m ade. Or if it can't be I'm  sure there will be plenty of patent infringem ent that cannot be addressed in the future.
