General Comment
AI is poison for creative industries, and doesn't provide any worthwhile service beyond stealing. People have been shown to divest away
from  AI technologies (As is the case with m arket share data for the iPhone 16, and Windows 11) showing that the m arket is trying to say
they're unneeded. However Silicon Valley needs this grift to go on, despite it not providing any m ore value than a search engine. 
I doubt this will have any serious thought put towards this com m ent, so I would just like to add: If AI gets free reign to train it's m odels on
private citizen's independent properties, then I'm  ignoring all copyright laws going forward and torrenting anything I want. Since giving AI
free-reign would prove these copyright laws are valueless.
