General Comment
This is theft, allowing AI to use artwork m ade by countless artists without their consent let alone knowledge as training data so it can churn
out soulless slop for a corporate m achine to replace their creative talent, and inch up the bottom  line is im m oral and sham eful! To take a
whole ocean of work which people have poured their very spirit into without even having the decency to financially com pensate them  for
their contributions is unjust to an unfathom able degree! You people "If you can even be called such a thing" are avaricious parasites who
feed off of the dream s and aspirations of virtuosos, and creatives who contribute m ore value to this world than you could ever hope to.
You sicken m e, and if you have any shred of hum anity you WILL term inate this action plan.
