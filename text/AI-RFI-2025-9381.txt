General Comment
Artificial intelligence, first and forem ost, should m ake sure to protect the rights and interests of the people that it draws data from .
Allowing AI to freely use copyrighted m aterial without needing to pay for licensing from  all people they take content from  would be
effective IP theft on a global scale, and should not be perm itted.
