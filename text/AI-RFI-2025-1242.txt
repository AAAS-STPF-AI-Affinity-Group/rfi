General Comment
This adm inistration is not doing anything on behalf of the Am erican People. They are doing everything selfishly and for the elite, but you
know that. None of the executive orders passed by this adm inistration are m eant to do anything less than dism antle the last rem aining
shred of a governm ent for the people. I hope the world hold you all to account and punish you to the greatest extent of the global law.
