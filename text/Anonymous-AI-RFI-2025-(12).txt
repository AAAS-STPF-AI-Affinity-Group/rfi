So, just to make sure I understand what is going on, so- called "artificial intelligence" can 
endlessly break copyright law and plagiarize all forms of art with no repercussion, but if an 
individual were to even so much as allude to a corporation's work without the owner's permission, said corporations will happily sue that person into the ground. It's ironic how soulless algorithms have better Fair Use laws than living breathing humans.
