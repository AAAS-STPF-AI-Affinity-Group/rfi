General Comment
Businesses that cannot exist without the theft of other people’s labor and property should not exist. 
Generative AI is built on theft on a m assive scale. The livelihood of thousands is gleefully exploited for profit without perm ission or
com pensation for their victim s. Sam  Altm an him self adm itted they cannot operate without stealing hum an labor and creativity. 
The protection of our property rights, including our intellectual property rights, is one of the foundational reasons governm ent exists. I urge
the governm ent to protect the people’s property rights and not allow these com panies to steal from  them  for their own corporate and
personal gain. Theft is theft.
