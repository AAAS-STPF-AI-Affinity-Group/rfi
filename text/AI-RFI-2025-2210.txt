General Comment
I definitely think the guard rail should be rem oved. We need to give President Trum p‘s friends, such as Elon Musk and Sam  Altm an,
unfettered access to profits so they can continue their dom ination of the Kingdom  of Am erica with no obstacles to whatever power they
m ay want. The fact that the technology is unproven has not yet been shown to actually work properly should not be in any way an
obstacle to funneling the whole of Am erican prosperity into their private pockets. There’s a long history in Am erica of people deservedly
getting paid for things don’t work, everything from  Trum p steaks to Trum p University, End it is only right that Trum p and his friends get to
continue to enrich them selves by defrauding to the Am erican public, and now, to not only receive m oney from  gullible fools, but from
everybody, by having it funnels directly to them  from  the federal governm ent. 
We should exem pt them  from  crim inal laws, as well, while they’re at it. Elon Musk works long days, if he hypothetically wanted to unwind
at night by doing heroin or killing a couple of prostitutes, it’s unfair that there are laws that stand in his way. It’s not fair or right that these
people should be subject to the sam e restrictions and rules that the rest of us are, when they are rich. For that reason, it’s wrong to require
them  to succeed by producing com m ercial products and succeeding the m arketplace, like the rest of us, rather than by getting governm ent
m oney and support funneled directly to them .
