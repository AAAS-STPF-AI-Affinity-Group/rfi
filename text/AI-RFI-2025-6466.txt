General Comment
While I understand the desire for innovation and progress in the field of artificial intelligence, I firm ly believe that AI also creates serious
legal and ethical issues, ultim ately underm ining the creative rights of individuals and organizations.
Copyright laws are fundam ental to protecting the intellectual property of creators, ensuring that their work is not used without consent or
fair com pensation. These laws are in place to incentive the creation of new ideas and artistic expressions by providing creators with
exclusive rights to their works. Im m unity from  these laws would not only violate the rights of individuals but could set a dangerous
precedent for how AI-generated content is treated in the future.
OpenAI, as a leader in AI technology, is well aware of the growing concern around the use of copyrighted m aterial in training AI m odels.
If OpenAI were granted im m unity from  copyright infringem ent claim s, it could open the floodgates for the widespread exploitation of
copyrighted works, including but not lim ited to books, m usic, im ages, and other form s of creative output. This would not only underm ine
the econom ic interests of creators but also erode the integrity of creative industries that rely on copyright protections to sustain their
livelihoods.
The question of whether OpenAI's m odels could be used to generate content that infringes on the copyrights of others is a pressing issue.
Im m unity from  copyright infringem ent claim s would absolve OpenAI from  any responsibility for potential m isuse of copyrighted m aterial,
enabling the proliferation of content that could easily violate intellectual property rights without consequence.
This potential lack of accountability could create an environm ent where creators, both large and sm all, are disincentivized to continue
producing original works. If AI system s can sim ply generate content that m im ics or reproduces copyrighted works without facing legal
repercussions, it could underm ine the financial stability and artistic innovation that copyright laws aim  to protect.
While AI has the potential to transform  industries, it should not com e at the expense of the rights of creators who contribute to the richness
and diversity of hum an culture. The law should ensure that AI developm ent does not encroach upon or exploit these rights, and that
com panies like OpenAI rem ain accountable for how their technologies are used.
