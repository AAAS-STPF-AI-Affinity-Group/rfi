General Comment
AI is not beneficial to the US and will actively hinder and harm  our society. I lost m y previous job due to AI and now have to work 3 jobs
just to stay afloat. AI is a copout, negatively im pacts the environm ent, and is a lazy m an's way of trying to infiltrate different aspects of the
workforce with little to no benefits.
