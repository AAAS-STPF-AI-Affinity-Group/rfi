Re: Palantir Comments on Development of an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan  
Dear Mr. D’Souza,  
Palantir Technologies Inc. (“Palantir”) is a U.S. -based software company that builds 
platforms to enable public, private, and non -governmental organizations to integrate, 
analyze, collaborate, and make operational decisions with their data, including throu gh 
the integration of AI capabilities, in a secure and privacy -protective way. At Palantir, we 
see our work as a duty and privilege: to support the United States of America, its vital 
national interests, and the civilization of which it is a part. We are p roud that this 
includes making the software upon which many of the world’s most vital institutions, 
from defense and intelligence agencies to companies in the healthcare, energy, and 
manufacturing sectors, rely.   
The United States stands at a critical juncture in artificial intelligence (AI) development 
and deployment. While the U.S. maintains significant advantages in AI innovation, it 
faces mounting challenges from nation -state adversaries and strategic competito rs, 
particularly the People’s Republic of China, under the leadership of the Chinese 
Communist Party. We should meet this challenge as Americans always have: with 
bravery, tenacity, and respect for the enormous responsibilities of freedom.   
This memo outlines specific action recommendations that will enhance U.S. AI 
leadership while promoting human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national 
security. Our response to this Request for Information (“RFI”) is based on insights 
gathered o ver 20 years of experience building technology to improve institutional 
mission outcomes while upholding American values in the use of our software products, 
including AI enablement tools and platforms.

Although Artificial Intelligence touches a vast aperture of policy issues, from energy 
consumption to workforce implications, we have focused our recommendations on the 
software and application portions of AI policy, covering five mission sets:  
1)Modernize Federal AI Acquisition and Deployment
2)Invest in Foundational Data Infrastructure to Support Operational Precision in AI
Applications Across All Agencies
3)Establish Initiatives and Incentives to Promote Sound AI Adoption and Innovation
4)Pursue Existing Opportunities for AI Adoption in Government
5)Maintain American Global Leadership in AI
We believe the following recommendations will help lay the groundwork for decades of 
strong, steady U.S. leadership in a world increasingly at risk to forces of instability, 
crisis, and conflict.    


   
                                                                                                 3  
RECOMMENDATIONS   
   
1. Modernize Federal AI Acquisition and Deployment  
  
America has the most vibrant and capable tech industry on the planet, yet policy 
and habit limit the federal government from taking full advantage of these 
capabilities due to an unwillingness to challenge broken orthodoxies and fix 
byzantine procurement a nd certification processes. This has contributed to 
severe inefficiencies across the federal government that waste the wealth of the 
American people and imperil the ability of our nation’s bedrock institutions to 
execute on their most critical missions. To  secure freedom, safeguard private 
data, and deliver prosperity for the American people in the 21st century, the 
federal government must streamline and accelerate the acquisition and 
implementation of AI capabilities across federal agencies. We recommend the 
following steps to achieve this mission:   
  
a.  Revamp and Strengthen the Federal Acquisition Streamline Act (FASA) 
Taxpayer dollars must be spent prudently, avoiding unnecessary waste and 
costly delays. Custom development is expensive and time -consuming when 
commercially available products can be modified to meet government needs, 
as is customarily done in the commerci al market. As implemented, FASA 
requires that the head of an agency procure commercial services or products 
to the maximum extent practicable, to include a requirement to modify 
requirements to ensure that commercial products can meet an agency's 
needs.    
  
Complying with FASA should include prioritizing procurement of modifiable 
commercial products over custom development, absent rare and justifiable 
circumstances. The recent memo issued by Secretary of Defense Hegseth 
directing the use of Commercial Solutio ns Openings and Other Transactions 
as the default solicitation and award approaches for acquiring software 
capabilities is an important step to ensuring the commercial acquisition of 
proven AI capabilities. As the Department of Defense looks to implement 
Secretary Hegseth’s guidance, it will be key to ensure that best practices for 
procuring commercial AI solutions are adopted and that acquisition 
professionals are trained on how to best employ these contracting vehicles. 
Other Agencies should consider impl ementing similar guidance.   
 
Congress is already pursuing reforms to the procurement and acquisition 
process, such as the FoRGED Act, introduced by Senator Roger Wicker, 
which proposes that by default, all products and services acquired by the 
Department of Defense (DoD) must be comme rcial. The FoRGED Act 


4 
represents an excellent starting point, but much more must be done to ensure 
a cultural change within implementing agencies that speeds up the acquisition 
of proven commercial AI capabilities ready to be deployed in the fight today. 
To begin this process, it would be prudent to review all proposed and inflight 
projects for FASA compliance, and those that are noncompliant, especially 
those early in process, should be reviewed and potentially recompeted in a 
FASA -compliant manner.   
b.Reform the Authority to Operate (ATO) process to accelerate AI system
deployment
The ATO process for AI systems should be streamlined and accelerated. This
includes developing clear guidelines for AI system security assessments,
leveraging automated security testing tools, establishing a risk -based
approach to ATO approvals, and establ ishing a clear path to reciprocity
between agencies. This will enable faster deployment of critical AI capabilities
without compromising security.
c.Expand use of Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs) for AI procurement
with appropriate commercial contracting terms
OTAs provide a flexible and efficient mechanism for procuring innovative
technologies like AI. Expanding the use of OTAs for AI could allow agencies
to rapidly acquire cutting -edge AI solutions from non -traditional vendors and
accelerate the pace of AI ado ption within the government. To be the most
effective, guidance for use of OTAs for AI should include commercial
provisions to align to the intent of OTAs being vehicles for non -traditional
vendors. Potential provisions could include mandating that firm, f ixed-price
contract types and standard commercial intellectual property terms are
included in such agreements to prevent the trend of turning OTAs into FAR -
like vehicles – while still providing for the rigorous security and other
capabilities assurances necessary to align with critical standards and delivery
requirements.

2. Invest in Foundational Data Infrastructure to Support Operational
Precision in AI Applications Across Agencies
We are at the early stages of an AI revolution, and America’s success depends 
not only on continuing to develop cutting -edge technologies of increasing power 
and sophistication, but also on building and maintaining the critical infrastructure 
necessary to ensure operational precision in their many applications, from 
machine shop floors, to clinical health environments, to the battlefield.   
Additionally, the force -multiplying power of AI models — speed, scale, processing 
volume, etc. — requires exact configurations to domain -specific contexts, 
standards, and policies. To enable government agencies to field AI for real -world, 
operational use c ases, efficiently and with maximal regard for meeting domain -
specific markers of excellence, we recommend the following investments:   
a.Testing and Evaluation Capabilities, Guidelines, and Environments
Testing and Evaluation ( “T&E”) is critical for getting AI from prototype to
production. For government agencies to wield AI as a tool to solve real -world
challenges, the Administration should prioritize establishing dedicated T&E
capabilities for AI systems that are able to validate p erformance prior to
general release and assist with ongoing monitoring to track performance in
operational use.
Additionally, AI projects are frequently held up due to a lack of clear guidelines 
on fielding certification requirements that set a minimum bar for 
implementation while supporting iterative improvement to meet requirements 
for full production system.   
These lines of effort must go hand -in-hand with upskilling government 
workers who can competently perform the testing, evaluation, and validation 
workflows. This will require building human capacity  for T&E – that is, small 
teams serving as government counterparts to commercial vendors who carry 
expertise and are conversant in the latest T&E methodologies and tools. 
Skilled T&E teams should be trained to engage in the context -specific 
challenges of a  given application environment in order to support fine -tuned 
evaluations that provide the rigor and confidence to get AI into production. On 
a human resource level, these teams should constitute relatively minor 
investments, but are nonetheless crucial for unlocking the massive increases 
of productivity and effi ciency made possible by well -deployed AI.   


6 
b.Privacy, Security, Data Protection, and Data Governance
Privacy is not just a matter of individual rights; it is a national security issue. It
is therefore critical for Federal agencies to prioritize infrastructure and
applications that best secure the freedoms of the American people and
promote human flourishi ng – particularly those measures that will safeguard
individual privacy and the security of sensitive data.  Programs that fail to give
primacy to these considerations or that favor technologies built with poor
privacy and security hygiene will ultimately be susceptible to vulnerabilities
that place U.S. citizens’ personal information at risk of breach and exploitation
by our adversaries and their proxies.
Moreover, ensuring best practices for data governance and oversight are 
crucial to facilitating testing, evaluation, validation, and monitoring; enabling 
appropriate human interventions; and providing for retrospective audit 
analyses that help to ensure op erational precision of AI systems in the most 
consequential settings.   
We believe that these measures are crucial to ensuring AI adoption and 
innovation efforts best serve the American people, check potential federal 
overreach, and defend against hostile actors:   
•Establishing robust access controls to ensure data is only accessible to
authorized personnel and systems;
•Maintaining efficient data deletion mechanisms to comply with storage
limitation and retention minimization principles;
•Requiring effective data minimization practices to ensure only necessary
data is collected and retained; and
•Utilizing comprehensive data lineage tracking to maintain transparency
and accountability in AI systems.
By prioritizing these fundamental building blocks, we can create a solid 
foundation for AI development across government agencies, ensuring that 
privacy and security are built into AI systems from the ground up and, most 
importantly, the rights of the Amer ican people are respected.

3. Establish Initiatives and Incentives to Promote Sound AI
Adoption and Innovation
We offer here two straightforward recommendations for addressing two of the 
most significant impediments to AI systems adoption: a) the dearth of high 
quality, domain -specific data critical to training and fine -tuning AI models and 
application environments , and b) the lack of dedicated budget allocations needed 
to programmatically align agencies towards AI -enriched outcomes:  
a.Testbed Initiative
Government agencies generate a wealth of data as they pursue their
missions. We recommend leveraging these vast data holdings by creating
agency -specific AI testbeds that utilize operationally relevant data (in
appropriately deidentified or minimized form) , alongside descriptions of
agency problems and use cases, in an environment that allows for
collaboration with external stakeholders, and that supports proper access
controls, security measures, and privacy protection to advance the missions
of their agen cy.
In this way, testbeds will simultaneously support the AI ecosystem of 
researchers, startups, and larger tech companies, while assisting agencies in 
more efficiently and effectively fulfilling their mission.   
At minimum, these testbeds should: 
•Provide commercial AI companies and researchers with secure access to
relevant datasets for developing and testing AI applications;
•Foster innovation by allowing AI developers to work with real -world,
complex data that reflects the challenges faced by government agencies;
and
•Simplify and accelerate government use of AI models, since they are built
using data reflecting real -world complexities.
To implement this initiative effectively, we recommend: 
•Establishing well -defined intellectual property rights frameworks that
encourage innovation while protecting government interests;
•Implementing collaborative mechanisms that allow for feedback between
AI developers and the agencies providing the data, creating a virtuous
cycle of improvement and refinement; and


   
                                                                                                 8  
• Ensuring that agency privacy officers review and approve necessary and 
adequate deidentification procedures for personally identifying datasets 
placed in testbeds, as well as develop standards for appropriate access 
and use cases pursued by researchers, co mmercial companies, and other 
organizations authorized to use agency data.  
  
Finally, current efforts, such as the data available through data.gov, support 
government data transparency goals but do not allow for effective feedback 
mechanisms with the organizations providing the data. Moreover, more 
sensitive data, due to security, privacy, or other concerns, is not available via 
data.gov.  
  
The proposed testbed initiative would address these limitations by providing a 
secure and controlled environment for AI development with more 
comprehensive datasets. This approach can unlock numerous advancements 
and efficiencies, from catching fraud at CM S, to advancing cancer research at 
the NIH, to enhancing our national security at the DoD.  
   
b.  Increase AI budget allocation to at least 1% of agency budgets   
AI technology provides a way for the government to increase the quality of its 
service to Americans while simultaneously reducing costs and saving the 
taxpayer money. To encourage AI adoption in the face of bureaucratic drift, 
the Trump Administration shou ld set as a goal that 1% of every agency 
budget be spent on AI modernization efforts.

4. Pursue Existing Opportunities for AI Adoption in Government
There are already several critical areas where AI integration would be of great 
benefit to the American people. We recommend the following as clear, quick wins 
for the Administration while emphasizing that AI -driven solutions can and should 
be applied to t he full aperture of the federal government:    
a.Expand funding for integration of AI into C2 systems
Command and Control ( “C2”) systems require constant insights in real time
from varied and complex datasets, and streamlined decision making and
seamless communication across many different platforms is critical for
maintaining America’s advantage on the battlefield. AI has already  proven
crucial to this endeavor, as evidenced by the success of programs like Project
Maven. Further investments integrating AI throughout our C2 systems,
including clear pathways for moving AI experiments to production as they
prove themselves out, will augment the capabilities of our military and keep
Americans safe.
b.Expand investments in Healthcare data sources
Given its sensitivities, labyrinthine organization, and massive costs,
healthcare remains an industry where further AI investment is sorely needed.
In particular, better cultivation and maintenance of healthcare datasets would
pave the way for an expansion  of AI-driven solutions across the field —
bringing down costs, ensuring private, sensitive data is more secure, and
enabling better care. Initiatives like the National COVID Cohort Collaborative
(N3C) have demonstrated the effectiveness of these efforts, and the
government should continue to pursue similar opportunities where prudent.
c.Enhance Fraud Detection Capabilities
As efforts continue to ensure taxpayer money is spent in ways that further the
core interests of the American people, there are extraordinary opportunities to
leverage AI’s capabilities to detect instances of fraud and corruption.
Procurement fraud at the DoD, through efforts like inflated billing or rigged
bidding, could be more easily detected using AI -driven models, as could off-
label  promotion fraud at the expense of programs like Medicare and
Medicaid. The work of entities like the Department of Govern ment Efficiency
and GAO targeting waste, fraud, and abuse should be standardized across
agencies so that potential malfeasance can be monitored and dealt with in
real time. Investing in AI -driven mechanisms to assist in these tasks provides
a powerful, cos t-effective force multiplier for accomplishing this mission.


10 
d.Agency-specific Flagship AI Programs
Finally, we recommend that the Trump Administration include in its AI Action
Plan a mandate for each government agency to complete a new flagship AI
project within nine months of the Action Plan being published, working
through OSTP for project approval and completion. Such a directive would
encourage domain experts and public servants to think critically and
creatively about ways to serve the American people more effecti vely while
advancing their agency’s core mission sets.


   
                                                                                                 11  
5. Maintain American Global Leadership in AI  
   
As adversaries and groups hostile to the United States seek to utilize AI to 
advance their own interests, it is crucial for the U.S. to demonstrate leadership in 
the development of this technology and that we preserve a clear focus on the 
values that under gird our nation. We suggest the following measures for 
preserving America’s technological edge, advancing its role as a leader in AI, and 
securing  the fundamental freedoms that help constitute our nation’s greatness :  
   
a. Strengthen American AI Leadership by Hosting the next Global AI  
Summit in Silicon Valley in 2025   
The three major global AI summits have taken place in the United Kingdom, 
Korea and most recently, France. To reinforce its position as the unrivaled 
leader in AI and take the helm in shaping the future of this transformational 
technology, the United State s should host the next global AI summit. As home 
to the world's most innovative tech companies and cutting -edge research, 
America is uniquely equipped to guide global discourse on AI governance, 
development, and, most critically, opportunity.   
   
The next summit should be held in Silicon Valley. This would achieve two 
objectives: First, it would serve as an important symbolic reminder of the 
region's deep historical ties to American national security, a message all of 
the Valley needs to hear today . Cold War -era partnerships between Stanford, 
DARPA, and early tech firms like Fairchild Semiconductor, or the space race 
contributions from NASA and Silicon Valley engineers, should be front of mind 
in light of current threats to the United States. Second , hosting the summit in 
Silicon Valley would serve as a powerful statement to domestic and global 
audiences alike that the Valley’s tech ecosystem has long thrived through 
government synergy, making it the ideal stage to chart AI’s future.  
      
b. Limit Adversary Access to Cutting Edge AI Hardware by Leveraging  
Chip Diplomacy and Robust Export Controls  
It is more crucial than ever to take steps that will slow advancements in this 
technology by America’s adversaries, chiefly the Chinese Communist Party. 
Accordingly, the United States must continue to implement and enforce robust 
export control policies to  prevent the most advanced AI chips from reaching 
China, a measure crucial for maintaining America's competitive edge in AI 
development and national security. These policies should include strict 
regulations on the export of high -end AI chips, regular upda tes to the list of 
controlled technologies, and collaboration with allied nations to create a 
unified approach.  
  


12 
To effectively enforce these controls, it is essential to develop and deploy 
advanced software technology capable of detecting and preventing smuggling 
through third -party countries and companies. This could involve AI -powered 
monitoring systems, technolog y for enhanced traceability, and sophisticated 
data analytics to identify suspicious patterns in global chip transactions.   
By addressing the challenge of third -party smuggling and implementing 
comprehensive export controls, the U.S. can significantly impede China's 
access to cutting -edge AI hardware. This approach, combined with increased 
investment in domestic AI chip researc h and development, fostering 
partnerships between government, academia, and industry, and encouraging 
talent retention in the AI sector, will help ensure that America maintains its 
technological superiority in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intel ligence. As 
AI capabilities increasingly influence global power dynamics, these measures 
will be vital not only to maintaining economic competitiveness but also to 
safeguarding America's core national security interests.   
c.Reaffirm American Values in and through AI adoption as the necessary
alternative to our adversaries
America’s adversaries are determined to use the awesome potential of AI
technologies exactly as they have always taken advantage of innovation in
science, engineering, and manufacturing: to enhance their power, subjugate
their people, undermine their enemi es, and extinguish liberty.  To secure
American freedom, the United States must drive and lead AI innovation in
ways that affirm our fundamental values alongside like -minded partners and
allies.
Starting points for such work already exist in the form of multilateral 
partnerships like the Quad, NATO, the Group of Seven (G7), the Indo Pacific 
Economic Framework (IPEF), AUKUS, and the Five Eyes. The U.S. should 
leverage these partnerships, leading co llaborative efforts to produce AI -driven 
systems that serve our shared interests, both security and economic, and 
maintain the advantage over our adversaries.   
The AI race is as much a competition for the elevation of values and first 
principles as it is a critical contest for technological supremacy. By taking 
these steps, we feel the U.S. can maintain its advantage and leadership. 


   
                                                                                                 13  
CONCLUSION   
   
The United States must act decisively to maintain its AI leadership position while 
ensuring these groundbreaking, world -shaping technological advancements align not 
with the worldview favored by authoritarian regimes, but rather with those values which 
promote liberty and human flourishing. This will require significant investment and broad 
institutional reform, and above all, it will demand sustained commitment to America’s 
core values and interests, as well as a full understanding of the intersection betw een 
these values and future AI development. The recommendations outlined above provide 
a framework for achieving these objectives while maintaining America’s competitive 
advantage in this critical technology.   
   
Success in this endeavor will require unprecedented cooperation between government, 
industry, and academia, as well as strong international partnerships. The cost of 
inaction - in terms of national security, economic competitiveness, and human welfare - 
far exceeds the investments required for implementation.
