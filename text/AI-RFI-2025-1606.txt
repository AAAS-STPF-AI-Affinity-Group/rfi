General Comment
As if this dum pster fire of an Adm inistration could not m ake any m ore decisions against the interests of the Am erican people. Gutting
intellectual copyright protections seeks only to benefit thieves who value their hexagonal-shaped profile pictures on X over hum an
ingenuity and creationism . It sets a precedent that no m an is truly free to create - which is wholly antithetical to the very concept of the
“Land of the Free,” in favor of tech-bros and robotic despots that were not even born on this soil. You seek to destroy that which defines
hum anity with this draft, and should it m ove forward - you will have a lot m ore to fear for. A fascist regim e begins with the stripping of
expressionism , am ong all creatives, as their ideas threaten authority the m ost and evoke em otions in a way that no politician could hope to
wield m eaningfully. Sham e on you, every m em ber of your “adm inistration”, and every grain of dirt unfortunate enough to land below your
gangled, bunion-riddled feet. You are lower than scum , and the Am erican people will not forgive these transgressions against their right to
hum anity.
