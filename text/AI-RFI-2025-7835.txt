General Comment
I have very real concerns about the use of copyrighted m aterial for training AI m odels, and I believe the possible change in rules to allow
this training on copyrighted work to be inherently dangerous and m orally wrong. 
What is the incentive for hum an artists, writers, film m akers, and m usicians to create new works if they are going to be ingested by AI
without perm ission? How are they supposed to live and thrive if their works are used this way?
There is already a backlash growing against generative AI use, because people want to know that the art they are enjoying is the work of
another hum an, and not soulless AI slop. 
Protect the creators of artistic works, and do not allow corporations to use their works without perm ission.
