General Comment
All these com panies do is steal, they even adm itted what their actions are, this shall not pass, they should not be allowed to bypass
copyright laws of any kind, they exist for very valuable reasons, if they can't operate with copyrighted works, they should've never started
to begin
Letting them  take from  copyrighted works will allow for further abuse of the law from  these com panies and m uch, m uch m ore harm  to
everything and everyone
Stealing should not be allowed at all, no m atter what, and if the tech can't exist without stealing from  literally everyone, while also doing
critical dam age to the environm ent and people, I question why this tech was even allowed to exist in the first place, and all it does is create
m ore alarm ing problem s as it goes, with no real benefits to the world other than m aking it burn faster and faster, this is no innovation at all,
it's abuse and destruction with a sloppy ribbon on top
