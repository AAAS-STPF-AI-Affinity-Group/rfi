To whom it may concern,  
My name is Sophia Echavarria and this is a terrible idea. I do not believe AI holds a place in
the future of the US. AI is actively making Americans worse at critical thinking and removingthe need for critical thinking and reading skills in our population.
 
AI steals from my livelihood as an American and profits off of theft of original works. Thiswill set a precedence that copywrite means nothing anymore and content theft and copyrightinfringement will no longer be punishable by law. It requires energy and water that should begoing to American residents and tax payers, creating additional burdens on our alreadysuffering environments.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the American public.If you want to preserve America, you will hold AI companies accountable on all fronts.This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-
