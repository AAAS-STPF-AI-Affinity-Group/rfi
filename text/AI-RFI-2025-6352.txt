General Comment
While I com pletely understand that AI technology has the potential to com pletely revolutionize agricultural, m edical, and industrial fields,
with where that technology is at now I cannot support this proposal which will give com pletely unrestricted data access to AI com panies
who have no interest in advancing AI for the good of working citizens.
Specifically, Generative AI has no place in society, as it m erely serves to steal and discredit the hard work of artists and creative
innovators all to sim ply peddle the prom ise of m ore 'content' for the naive and uninform ed.
For as long as intellectual property has been recognized as som ething unique and valuable, the law has put protections in place so that
brilliant m inds can be rewarded for thinking up what was thought to be unthinkable, to innovate on things thought to be concrete and
stagnating, and for taking the steps to actualizing their ideas with their m ind and body. Generative AI disrespects the history and virtues of
our intellectual property laws, all in the nam e of capital profit. Even worse, this 'profit' fails com pletely to com pensate those who are
contributing to the arts and academ ia - som etim es for just the joy of creating - and m erely goes to lining the pockets of people who fail to
understand the creative process or sim ply care not for anybody but them selves.
Generative AI is fundam entally built on theft, and therefore if it cannot exist without stealing, then it should not exist at all.
