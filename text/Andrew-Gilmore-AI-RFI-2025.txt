I remember a time when you all gave companies copyright and intellectual property rights but now when some tech  
bros want to steal from independent artists and people who actually put thought and life experiences in their work  
now all of a sudden because they dont have billions its ok to rob them of the same protections so you can get script  
kiddies to pretend they are artists or automate someone’s job away when they need that money? Sounds hypocritical  
dont it? The US supreme court has ruled that only human created works can receive IP and copyright protections so  
if i were less scrupulous, like you folks, i could take anything you create with AI and fix it to look like an actual  
human with a brain created it and claim it as my own. You guys really want that?
Secondly AI is extremely error prone, tends to forget more things than someone with memory issues, and  
completely lacks experience to automate complex tasks. This is why Israel’s drone program is such a blood bath  
creating powerhouse, United Health’s policy denied so many valid claims, etc. “AI” cannot comprehend nuance like  
someone with experience can. Just stop chasing this bubble to our detriment.
