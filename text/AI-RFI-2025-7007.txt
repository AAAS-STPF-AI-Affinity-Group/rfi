General Comment
With copyright laws rem oved from  AI, we will see an influx of deepfake pornography—including content with children—and thousands of
counterfeit artwork that aim s to put hum an designers out of business. This is literally the m ost anti-Am erican thing the governm ent can do
regarding the whole AI discussion, because by allowing AI to go unchecked we will be losing thousands, if not MILLIONS, of Am erican
jobs across the political aisle, not just Dem ocrats. Auto workers will be replaced by assem bly line m achines, graphic designers will be
replaced by generative software, doctors and nurses will com pete with AI-generated diagnostic software, and the m ilitary as a whole will
have to constantly check itself to m ake sure the inform ation it's collecting online is legit and not from  spam  bots that are determ ined to
underm ine our national security. I get that we're in a rush to rem ove all the executive orders that the last adm inistration put in place but
rem oving it entirely out of political spite is not the answer. So, so m any Am ericans from  m ultiple dem ographics and incom e levels will be
put out of jobs if there are no copyright restrictions. Please, please reconsider this.
