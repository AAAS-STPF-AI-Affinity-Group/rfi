General Comment
If I have to pay a license to rights-holders to use copyright work in m y projects, then so does a com pany or organization training an AI on
said work for the purposes of com m ercial profit. OpenAI and other AI tech com panies, even those claim ing non-profit status, are
absolutely using copyright assets for the purpose of generating revenue without com pensating the rights-holders. If they are allowed to use
these works without respecting copyright law, then the law is null and void. If Adobe or Microsoft get to use m y copyrights without
perm ission or com pensation, then I can use WarnerDiscovery's m aterial without perm ission or com pensation in m y next project. Either
copyright law applies to all of us or to none of us.
