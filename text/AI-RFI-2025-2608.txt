General Comment
Firstly, I am  an artist who m akes a living off of the creative works that I produce. Allowing AI com panies carte blanche access to use m y
work in training data is directly underm ining m y ability to m ake that living. In a way, this would force m e to train m y direct com petitor for
m y livelihood.
Secondly, the energy dem ands that AI databases require is absolutely m onstrous. The ecological im pact of these com panies cannot be
understated, and the sheer am ount of energy that these com panies use will dram atically increase the cost of energy. 
I do not want to be forced to subsidize these com panies with m y tax dollars or m y art.
