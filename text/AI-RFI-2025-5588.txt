General Comment
Reducing AI regulations will not enhance Am erican AI superiority, and instead only underm ine other am erican businesses and intellectual
property. Without such industries, the production of new AI data will be greatly reduced, and AI com panies will suffer for it. In addition, it
will ruin other econom ic prospects and generally suppress the econom y, which is an im pact on its own. If AI cannot be created without
sacrificing such industries, then such AI is not ready to exist. In no other industry would we subsidize an em erging technology to this
extent. AI com panies should be well funded in their algorithm ic research to reduce the required data for AI training until it can be trained
cheaply and with m inim al data. Throwing infinite am ounts of data at a poorly m ade algorithm  is not to the benefit of the AI, nor to the
industries it steals its data from .
Don't deregulate this.
