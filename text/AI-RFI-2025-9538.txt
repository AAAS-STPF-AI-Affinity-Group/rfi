General Comment
Hello and good evening, 
My nam e is Jacob Bauch, a student at the University of Montana and I’m  com m enting today with som e concerns about generative AI.
I’m  not the m ost eloquent so I’ll try to be brief at least for the sake of anyone reading this.
Generative AI can be very useful in m y field in m y studies, inform ation technology, but I have som e concerns about how its training data is
collected, and how available generative AI has been to the public in general. 
My m ain concern is about the livelihoods of self-em ployed artists and m usicians, as well as sm all businesses focusing on com m ercial
graphic design and production. It’s increasingly hard to today to survive and keep clients in art production as with an iconic style it
becom es easier for art to be reproduced. And rather than just straight copying intellectual property, a crim inal can instead instruct
generative AI to violate copyright after getting around som e sim ple protections and pass off this im itation art as created by the original
artist/com pany. My hope with this is that either copyrighted work wouldn’t be able to used as training m aterial at all without explicit
consent. Failing that I think it would be good if the original artist received som e sort of licensing fee, and that illicit AI generated content
would have som e sort of disclaim er to prevent it from  being confused with the original artist(s) or being m istaken as having copyright
protection like a hum an created work would have.
