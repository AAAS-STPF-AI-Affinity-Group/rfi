1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
As the global community intensifies its focus on artificial intelligence (AI), the role of advanced 
antenna systems in powering reliable and ethical AI solutions often receive insufficient attention 
in strategic discussions. I, Dr. Morissa Schwartz, a Subject Matter Expert in Antenna Theory & 
AI-Driven Solutions, enthusiastically present this 15-page proposal in response to the recent 
Federal Register Request for Information (RFI) on the Development of an AI Action Plan (Federal 
Register 2025-02305 ). 
In this proposal, I outline a strategy to integrate next-generation antenna technology with AI 
frameworks to optimize performance, security, ethics, and scalability. In other words, we’re 
bringing the synergy of Maxwell’s Equations and machine learning to orchestrate a new era in 
AI—one that’s powerful, inclusive, and responsibly managed. 
Key highlights:  • Performance and Optimization: Using AI to dynamically calibrate and optimize 
antenna arrays for minimal interference and maximal throughput. 
 • Security and Resilience: Embedding anomaly detection and cybersecurity 
measures to protect data integrity and system stability. 
 • Ethical Governance: Establishing transparent policies and explainable AI (XAI) 
solutions for public trust. 
 • Scalable Infrastructure: Accelerating pilot programs and deployment through 
partnerships with industry, academia, and government. 
This proposal begins by delineating the background of AI-driven antenna systems, outlines the 
problem statement, and describes a robust plan for bridging technical aspirations with 
real-world feasibility. Ultimately, we seek to establish a unified, efficient, and ethically robust AI 
ecosystem that harnesses advanced antenna technology to its fullest potential, enhancing 
connectivity and trust across industries and communities.

2. INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
The last decade has witnessed exponential advances in AI, from computer vision breakthroughs 
to generative language models. However, the foundational hardware—particularly antennas 
that facilitate data transfer—has sometimes been an afterthought in policy and strategy circles. 
2.1 Why Antenna Theory Matters to AI 
AI systems rely heavily on data throughput and real-time analysis. The performance of these 
systems can be seriously compromised if the signal transmission is weak, inefficient, or riddled 
with interference. Moreover, as we inch toward 6G wireless standards and Internet of Things 
(IoT) expansions, robust antenna designs become imperative. 
2.2 Recent Policy Directions 
In recent years, the U.S. government and global stakeholders have emphasized expanding AI 
research and guidelines, focusing on ethics, workforce training, and improved adoption. 
However, these efforts must also address the hardware underpinnings—including sophisticated 
antenna solutions—for an end-to-end AI ecosystem that is sustainable and equitably accessible. 3. SME QUALIFICATIONS AND VISION
3.1 My Background 
I am Dr . Morissa Schwartz, a New Jersey-based consultant with a doctorate in literature (yes, I 
spent plenty of time dissecting texts) and extensive credentials in marketing and 
communications, but I also have a strong footing in scientific exploration through my academic 
experiences in biomedical sciences and ongoing collaborations with engineering and telecom 
experts. My unique vantage point links rigorous technical knowledge with the broader 
socio-ethical dimensions of emerging technologies. 
I have collaborated with several telecommunication startups, advised on advanced 
beamforming techniques, and co-authored research papers on AI-driven antenna optimization. 
Additionally, I founded an indie publishing company, championing emerging voices, which aligns 
with my commitment innovation in all endeavors. 
3.2 Vision 


My vision for the AI Action Plan is an environment where policymakers, industry leaders, and 
academia come together to: 
• Foster highly efficient, resilient antenna systems that reduce resource waste and
expand connectivity. 
• Apply AI algorithms for real-time, dynamic tuning of signal parameters.
• Uphold ethical standards through explainable and transparent AI solutions.
We can build an AI-driven future that is equitable, secure, and open to ongoing 
improvements—a tall order, but one that’s well within reach with clear policies and strategic 
investment. 
4. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Despite tremendous strides in AI, the lack of a coherent, hardware-focused policy framework 
hampers large-scale deployment. Key challenges include: 
1. Fragmented Governance: Disparate regulatory frameworks for wireless
communication and AI hamper cross-sector synergy. 
2. Inefficiencies in Spectrum Use: Outdated or underutilized frequency bands cause
interference, leading to suboptimal AI system performance. 
3. Cybersecurity Gaps: Without robust AI-driven detection methods, adversaries
can exploit vulnerabilities in next-gen communication networks. 
4. Public Trust & Ethics: The public remains concerned about data privacy,
especially as data is increasingly collected via ubiquitous sensors and antennas. 
Addressing these concerns holistically is crucial for an AI Action Plan that delivers measurable 
benefits—rather than just more white noise. 
5. OBJECTIVES FOR THE AI AC TION PLAN
5.1 P erformance and Optimization 
• Objective: Seamlessly integrate advanced antenna research and AI-driven
algorithms to bolster network throughput, reduce latency, and improve coverage. 


 • Example: Utilizing real-time machine learning to shape and direct antenna 
beams, preventing signal loss during critical communications. 
5.2 Security and Resilience 
 • Objective: Build an AI-based defense mechanism for wireless systems, detecting 
anomalous usage or malicious attacks before they escalate. 
 • Example: Real-time monitoring tools with advanced anomaly detection that 
identifies suspicious spikes in data traffic. 
5.3 Ethical Governance 
 • Objective: Create guidelines ensuring that antenna-driven AI solutions adhere to 
privacy, transparency, and fairness standards. 
 • Example: Mandating robust encryption for user data and requiring Explainable AI 
(XAI) for critical decisions, because nobody wants a black-box AI telling them their data is “just 
for synergy.” 
5.4 Scalable Infrastructure 
 • Objective: Encourage fast-track pilot programs and cross-industry collaboration 
for rolling out advanced AI antenna solutions. 
 • Example: Federal grants and incentives for 5G/6G testbeds to quickly validate 
next-gen antenna designs, ensuring we’re not perpetually in “beta” mode.

12. CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS 
The synergy of advanced antenna theory and AI-driven solutions has the potential to 
revolutionize connectivity, data management, and public services. By underscoring the 
significance of ethical governance, performance optimization, collaboration, and workforce 
development, we can ascertain that the AI Action Plan surpasses mere theoretical potential and 
effectuates substantive enhancements to daily life, all while safeguarding personal data from 
unauthorized access by external entities. 
Immediate Next Steps:  1. Form the Steering Committee: Engage stakeholders, finalize leadership roles, and 
coordinate cross-sector input.
