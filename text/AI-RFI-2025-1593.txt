General Comment
I’m  a fiction writer reaching out to you in regards to m y concern over generative AI’s ram pant abuse of US copyright. Com panies like
OpenAi blatantly steal the copyrighted m aterial of hardworking artists and writers without their perm ission and without com pensating
them . This is incredibly dem oralizing to sm all artists struggling to m ake a living and destroys their incentive to create the art and
entertainm ent that the public loves and enjoys so m uch. 
I’m  thereby asking you to stand with hum anity and protect artists against generative AI’s copyright infringem ent within your AI Action
Plan.
Thank you.
