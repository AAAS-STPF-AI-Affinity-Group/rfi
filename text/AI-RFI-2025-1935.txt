General Comment
No Generative AI com pany has been profitable for several years, despite extensive advertising cam paigns. Recent m odels from  Chat
GPT show little im provem ent over previous m odels. 
There is a GREAT risk of wasting governm ent funds pursuing a goal that m ay never be achieved. 
Generative AI technology also relies on scraping data from  copyrighted m aterials without perm ission, violating the intellectual property
laws of the United States. The technology poses a significant threat to the work of visual artists and writers. 
While innovation should be encouraged, the laws need to be upheld. AI needs som e form  of regulation. The people's m oney should be not
spent carelessly. 
The federal governm ent should investigate the death of Suchir Balaji.
