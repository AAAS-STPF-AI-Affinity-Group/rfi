General Comment
One of Am erica's m ost influential and profitable export is m edia and entertainm ent. If no one's Intellectual Property is protected then no
one would have any confidence investing in Am erica for developing their m edia, and would instead seek other countries who offer better
protections against "Artificial Intelligence" m isuse and abuse. Copyrights m ust be upheld and protected from  generative AI use because
these technologies do not create anything new, only regurgitate what they are fed and consequently violate copyrights. Allowing ram pant,
unchecked abuse of generative AI will cause another of Am erica's industry strongholds to collapse.
