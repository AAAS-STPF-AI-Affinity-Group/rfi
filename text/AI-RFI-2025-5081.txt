General Comment
I don't want any of this. So-called Artificial Intelligence has not proven it is able to perform  tasks without hallucinating, nor is it able to
accom plish anything generative without having to violate the rights of writers and artists everywhere in order to train these faulty m odels.
Chasing a flash-in-the-pan speculative technology is the worst possible m ove for any large institution, let a lone governm ent.
