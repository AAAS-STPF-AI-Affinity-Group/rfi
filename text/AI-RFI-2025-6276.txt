General Comment
To the White House,
Please do not allow OpenAI and any other AI-based com pany to continue to exploit or steal the works of us artists and everyone in the
creative industry for their own m onetary gain. We have been putting up with this theft for a good while now weâ€™ve had enough.
So I will say this: please do the right thing and say no to AI stealing original content m ade by hum ans.
