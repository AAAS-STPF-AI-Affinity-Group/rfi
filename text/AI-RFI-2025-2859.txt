General Comment
Do NOT do this. By doing this AI can breach copyrights on artists and any other entities. Disney is an exam ple of this too. You're
opening a whole slewth of things that just are not needed. AI does not need to be som ething that Am ericans need to be known for
because at the end of the day, it's just stolen content m ade to look like it is original.
