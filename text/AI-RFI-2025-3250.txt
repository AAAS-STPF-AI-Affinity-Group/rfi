General Comment
AI is a bubble and will not be nearly as technologically im portant in day to day life for the public. In 10 years we will see ai used for
specialized tasks in specialized jobs that hum ans cannot do. Giving ai com panies free use of copyright just m eans m ore power and water
draw right now for no overall gain in the long term . When the bubble pops this law will m ean nothing in the interim . Protect the rights of the
proper owners instead of those who want to take and will give nothing in return.
