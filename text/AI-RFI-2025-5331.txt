General Comment
AI has not m ade any strives in profitability or prom otion of any Am erican com pany. It is a dead end technology and is being pushed by
terrible businesses with no value or ability to m ake a product without theft of IP. They claim  China will focus in AI when all evidence
points to the CCP not having a desire to use a fake technology with no use case. This is the sam e as the Soviets tricking us into studying
ESP and psychic powers. It would be foolish to fall for that ruse again.
