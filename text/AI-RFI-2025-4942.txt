General Comment
No com pany, product, or invention should be placed above the existing copyright law. Especially when the foundation of AI is stolen
artwork and the use of AI is so detrim ental to the environm ent and artistic opportunities for hum an beings. AI should not be given blanket
protection from  copyright infringem ent lawsuits.
