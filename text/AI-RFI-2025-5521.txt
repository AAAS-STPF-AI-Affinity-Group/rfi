General Comment
Large Language Models are not the future for Am erica. Com panies like OpenAI do not need protection. No other com pany or industry is
allowed to **STEAL** other peopleâ€™s intellectual property. The tech industry needs rules and regulation because they will not be able to
regulate them selves. In addition the AI hype is already dying down. There is no reason to given them  free rein because quite frankly they
provide no real intrinsic value. They know this! Which is why they want the ability to **STEAL** other peoples hard work. Do not give
them  the ability.
