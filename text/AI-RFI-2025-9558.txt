General Comment
Creating a carve out for generative AI com panies to bypass copywrite laws is a recipe for disaster for protecting intellectual property. AI
doesnâ€™t create, it copies from  the valuable work of real people. This will hurt sm all, independent creators the m ost, m aking their work
worthless. This should be stopped and these AI com panies, who have already been training their m odels illegally should be forced to
com pensate creators for their works.
