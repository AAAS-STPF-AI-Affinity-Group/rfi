General Comment
I am  strongly against developm ent of AI in nearly every space or occupation. Content, personal inform ation, copyrighted m edia, etc. are
forcibly being funneled into AI training program s at a rapid rate. The quality of inform ation and m edia readily available is declining at a
rapid rate. AI content is pollution fueled by stolen assets. Our inform ation m ust be protected and regulated by hum ans, not artificial
intelligence.
