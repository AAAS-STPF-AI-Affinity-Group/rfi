General Comment
The idea that a dem onstrably proven waste of m oney, tim e and energy would be worth any kind of special treatm ent is absurd. OpenAI
and their ilk are a shell, operating on speculative value, borrowed tim e and, frankly, the ignorance and gullibility of people who don't know
better. I seem  to rem em ber a tim e not so long ago when the federal governm ent was m oving heaven and earth to stop people from
violating copyright law on the internet, but it seem s now that a cadre of insufferable fools have conned the tech industry into sinking billions
into yet another bubble like NFTs and crypto before it, suddenly copyright doesn't m ean anything at all. Curious, that.
The arts in the US are already undervalued and trod upon enough--the last thing it needs is another boot on its already sole-im printed
neck. The notion that this technology has anything of m erit to contribute to culture, the econom y or national security would sound like an
early april fools joke if it weren't clear that m any upon the wheels of power are either greedy or dum b enough to believe this is what the
country needs.
We could be housing the hom eless and tackling clim ate change, and instead we're stuck fretting over Silicon Valley stocks. Just another
day in the good ol US of A.
