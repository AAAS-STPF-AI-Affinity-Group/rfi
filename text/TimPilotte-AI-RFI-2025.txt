I am writing to provide commentary on your AI action plan.
Respecting copyright ownership, which has been a foundation of America’s incentive for innovation and a great
enabler of progress, is not an “ unnecessarily burdensome requirement” that “hampesr private sector AI innovation.”It is the condition of the possibility of an innovative society that has a reason to bring innovations to market.
Just because AI is the latest innovation does not mean that its interest supersedes the interest of all innovators in the
country. It should not succeed at the expense of other innovators. It should not have a class of rules unto itself.
Enabling blatant copyright theft is not the path forward. If AI cannot innovate in a way that respects the innovations
of others, it doesn’t deserve to exist.
We can do better. Protect copyright laws, or we as a country will regret it.Thank you,
Tim
