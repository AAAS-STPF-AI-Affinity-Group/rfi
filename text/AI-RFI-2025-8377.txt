General Comment
This is a horrible idea that will have far reaching negative consequences for cyber security protocols and procedures in public and private
institutions, by essentially jeopardizing the privacy and safety of sensitive and top secret inform ation. 
Additionally, this will place the privacy, safety, and civil liberties/rights of m any individuals living in the United States at risk, and will only
ensure the United States, as a nation, collapses further whether that be through an enem y nation using AI for espionage and/or AI gaining
sentience and taking over the federal and state governm ents' com puter and network system s.
