General Comment
I believe that allowing OPEN AI to go down the route of taking whatever they want will weaken copyright laws to the point people will
not own anything they create. Musicians, artists, authors, and other groups of creators would lose desperately needed incom e. I would
also worry if this led to losing control over our own likenesses. Any public figure's likeness m ay be in danger of being used to advertize
harm ful products or faked crim es. What would future protections be like without copyright laws properly defended from  com panies,
especially when the people who run OPEN AI have dem onstrated a high level of irresponsibility when it com es to how their product is
used. There is also a disturbing trend of young m en who see AI as a real person to engage with. Becom ing em otionally attached to
som ething so fake can cause m ental harm  and lead to suicide. It's also a very large waste of m oney. There isn't enough com puter power to
train the program  to actually create things. It spits out data it already has, and by the tim e m ore people are aware of Sam  Altm an's lies told
to raise as m uch m oney for him self as possible, a lot of people will lose m oney. It doesn't seem  prudent to tie Am ericans to Altm an's
future failure.
