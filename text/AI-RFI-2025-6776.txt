General Comment
If OpenAI cannot m ake profit without the m ass theft of everyone's intellectual property then IT DOES NOT DESERVE TO EXIST!
Doubling down on generative AI will only create short term  benefits for a few elites, and everything else will be worse in the long run. You
will be ruining the lives of people who actually create for a living!
