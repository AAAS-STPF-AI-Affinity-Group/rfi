General Comment
Allowing one individual or group to violate the copyright of of others because they are unwilling to fairly reim burse the copyright owners is
abetting theft and willfully ignoring, actually debasing and throwing aside, the whole concept of copyright and the history of it in this
country and its longstanding and firm  establishm ent in law here. Please do not allow Open AI or any such com pany or organization to
sidestep copyright.
