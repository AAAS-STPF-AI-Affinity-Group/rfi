Subject: Response to the Request for Information on the Development of an
Artificial Intelligence Action Plan
Dear Sir or Madam,I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the forthcoming Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan, which will play a crucial role in shaping the United
States’ competitive position in AI research, development, and deployment. AI is atransformative technology that should be treated as an asset to national innovation,economic growth, and security rather than a domain of excessive regulation anddisproportionate scrutiny.
As an engaged citizen and strong proponent of AI-driven progress, I submit the
following considerations for your review:
I. The United States Must Prioritize AI Leadership to Remain Globally
Competitive
Artificial Intelligence is not merely an industry innovation but a critical pillar of
national strength, both economically and militarily. The most significant risk theU.S. faces is not AI itself, but the failure to advance its development at a pacethat ensures global leadership. Other nations, including China, are makingsubstantial investments in AI without the same regulatory constraints. The UnitedStates must recognize that restrictive policies will not slow down AI developmentabroad but will instead shift innovation away from American companies and
institutions.


To avoid this risk, the AI Action Plan must:
1.Establish clear and aggressive milestones  to measure AI advancement
relative to global competitors.
2.Incentivize strategic public-private partnerships to accelerate AI adoption
across critical sectors.
3.Minimize bureaucratic obstacles that hinder AI deployment in government
and industry.
A risk-based approach should account for not only the theoretical risks of AIbut also the real-world consequences of failing to lead in this domain.
II. AI Should Not Be Subject to a Higher Standard of Scrutiny Than Other
Technologies
AI is being disproportionately regulated compared to other technologies that pose
similar or greater risks. Automobiles continue to cause fatalities, yet society doesnot require perfection before allowing their use. Social media platforms spreadmisinformation, yet they are not held to impossible content accuracy standards.
By comparison, AI is often expected to be free from bias, perfectly explainable,
and incapable of making errors before it is deployed. These standards are
unrealistic and counterproductive. The AI Action Plan must take a realistic and
pragmatic approach that treats AI as a tool like any other, rather than as aninherently exceptional risk.
To ensure this, the plan should:
1.Avoid regulatory asymmetry that holds AI to higher standards than
comparable technologies .
2.Establish policies that focus on AI risk mitigation rather than unattainable
elimination of risk .
3.Recognize that innovation inherently involves uncertainty and that
excessive caution leads to stagnation.
III. The Government Should Not Intervene in Workforce Displacement
Caused by AI
Technological progress has always resulted in labor shifts. The invention of the
steam engine, the printing press, and the personal computer each disrupted entire
industries, yet they also created new opportunities. AI is no different.


The government should not focus on artificially protecting outdated job roles
but instead facilitate the transition to new industries and skills. A free-market
approach that allows industries to adapt organically will yield better outcomes
than direct intervention.
The AI Action Plan should:
1.Resist pressure to regulate AI in an attempt to preserve outdated job
categories .
2.Focus on AI-driven economic expansion, which will create moreopportunities than it displaces.
3.Encourage businesses to embrace AI-driven efficiencies  rather than fear
them.
The United States must lead, not resist, the next wave of industrial evolution.
IV. Open-Source AI is Essential for Decentralized Innovation
Artificial Intelligence must not become a closed and controlled technology
limited to a few corporate entities . Open-source AI ensures that innovation
remains decentralized and accessible to academia, startups, and the broader
research community.
The AI Action Plan must:
1.Encourage federal funding for open-source AI projects that allow for
public scrutiny and collaboration.
2.Ensure that government AI initiatives do not disproportionately benefit
proprietary corporate interests .
3.Prevent licensing models that restrict access to foundational AI
technologies.
A failure to prioritize open-source AI will result in an AI oligopoly controlled by a
few large entities , which is a far greater risk than AI development itself.
V. AI is Critical to National Security and Must Be Developed with StrategicIntent
Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming the security landscape. If the U.S.
does not integrate AI into cybersecurity, military defense, and intelligence
operations, adversaries will. The consequences of failing to act decisively will be
severe.


The AI Action Plan should prioritize:
1.AI-driven cybersecurity defenses to protect against AI-powered
cyberattacks.
2.Autonomous threat detection systems  for intelligence and defense
applications.
3.Strategic AI collaborations with allied nations to maintain a technologicaladvantage.
Conclusion: The U.S. Must Lead, Not Over-Regulate
The United States has historically led every major technological revolution . AI
must not be the exception. Overregulation and excessive caution will not stop AI
progress globally, but they will ensure that leadership shifts away from the
U.S..
The AI Action Plan must:
Prioritize AI leadership over excessive regulation .
Ensure AI is not held to a higher standard than other technologies.
Recognize that workforce shifts are inevitable and should not be
artificially mitigated .
Protect open-source innovation to prevent corporate monopolization .
Invest in AI for national security to maintain strategic dominance.
Artificial Intelligence is not a threat. The real threat is failing to lead in its
development.I appreciate your consideration of this response and encourage OSTP and NITRD to
develop an AI policy that ensures the United States remains at the forefront ofinnovation.
