General Comment
AI com panies have adm itted that they cannot turn a profit and pay the creators of the intellectual property they train their program s on. In
other words, the industry relies on the theft of intellectual property. Do not sacrifice the livelihood of hard-working creatives to help swell
this econom ic bubble.
