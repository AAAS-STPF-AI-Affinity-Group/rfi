AI Infrastructure – what is needed to keep US at the forefront?  
“It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global dominance 
in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national 
security. ”2 President Trump has said on several occasions that with the right public 
policies, the United States can solidify its position as the world leader in AI development 
and secure a brighter future for all Americans. Vantage supports a multi -pronged public 
policy approach to maintain  and secure  U.S. leadership on AI, including  efforts that  
encourag e additional investment into digital infrastructure, regulatory reforms to 
unleash more power  capacity, promoting workforce upskilling and reskilling, and 
fostering public -private collaboration.  Vantage recommends the following:  
1.Enhance America’s power  infrastructure to encourage domestic AI data center
growth 
Enhancing America's power  infrastructure is critical to maint ain and  accelerate  U.S. 
leadership in AI, technological innovation, and the global economy. Meeting the power  
demand for AI  and data center  end customer s’ requirements for reliable , affordable, and  
innovative power supplies,  and ensuring that the next wave of AI innovation is U.S.-
driven , requires immediate strategic investments to modernize  transmission 
infrastructure  and to build more  domestic power  generation capacity  for data centers . 
Currently, transmission capacity  limitations pose significant barriers to the growth of 
digital infrastructure across the U.S. Building an electrical transmission line can take more 
than a decade due to regulatory  and litigation hurdles.  For example, in Northern California 
and Central Washington, some utilities have indicated to data center operators that 
additional power is at least 7 -10 years away.  Although data centers  have achieved  
tremendous gains in  efficient operations and innovation in electricity delivery , their 
substantial demand for electrical power remains a  primary factor in investment  and siting  
decisions .   
Efforts to enhance power infrastructure should specifically target improvements  in the 
plan ning, permitting, and construction processes for long -range, inter -regional high -
voltage transmission lines in the United States. These transmission lines play a critical role 
in connecting the reliable  and timely electricity supplies that data center customers 
require to high -demand regions, thereby enhancing system reliability, and addressing 
growing electricity demands from data centers and AI deployments. Policymakers and 
regulators should prioritize  reforms that streamline and accelerate approvals for inter-
regional transmission infrastructure, significantly reducing current timelines and better

aligning the nation’s grid infrastructure with its long -term economic and technological 
objectives.  
Addressing these constraints also requires significant changes to existing utility business 
models, which currently lack adequate incentives for rapid and proactive infrastructure 
expansion. Current regulatory frameworks and traditional cost -recovery models often 
disincentivize utilities from investing proactively in new generation and transmission 
capacity. Increasingly, utilities are concerned about risk exposure when expanding 
generation and grid capacity to meet the needs of data centers. In response, s ome utilities 
have begun requiring significant upfront financial assurances from these customers, tying 
up considerable capital and credit for extended periods. Such requirements chill 
investment, strand valuable capital, and impede the development of addi tional data 
centers and investment in new growing U.S.  markets. To address this challenge, the 
Trump Administration and Congress should explore federal -level policy interventions —
such as loan guarantees, credit insurance, or revolving fund programs —to help utilities 
manage risk without overly burdening data center operators. Successful models already 
exist, including programs administered by the US Department of Energy’s Loan Programs 
Office and the US Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service, which could be 
adapted or expanded to ease upfront capital burdens, enha nce investor confidence, and 
enable critical infrastructure deployment.  
The Trump Administration, along with other U .S. federal, state, and local policymakers 
and regulators, should  also explore and implement reforms that align utility incentives 
with the strategic need to meet future electricity demand, enhance system reliability, 
and promote innovation. Areas of focus for these reforms should include encouraging : 
1)better transmission planning by utilities and regional transmission organizations ; 2)
faster processing of interconnection requests by regulators ; 3) collaboratio n among data
centers, utilities, and independent power producers;  and 4) timely review and approvals
of permits .
Substantial investments are urgently needed, not only in transmission infrastructure but 
also in expanding domestic power  generation capacity . The need is so great that data 
center operators like Vantage have had to take matters into their own hands ; recentl y, 
we began the operation of  a co-located  utility -scale , natural gas -power ed generation 
plant  in Virginia to  power our second Sterling -area  campus  to meet customer demand. 
However, this alone is insufficient to address the growing need for more capacity  for cloud 
computing and AI deployments  and to meet customer requirements around data center 
delivery, design , efficiency, and operations . Achieving this growth depends on 
comprehensive policy reforms  that the Trump Administration should undertake , 


including streamlining permitting processes, enabling  and prioritizing  behind -the-meter  
self-generation and co- location  solutions , identifying and opening suitable federal lands 
in pr oximity  to high -demand markets  for data center  and energy infrastructure 
development, and rethinking the utility  regulatory environment to accelerate the 
deployment of generation and transmission projects. 
The slow pace of infrastructure expansion stems from outdated and prolonged  permitting 
processes, complex regulatory frameworks, and insufficient long -term forecasting of 
power needs. Comprehensive long -term forecasts of power demand, combined with 
enhanced transparency, scenario planning, and closer stakeholder collaboration, are 
essential to addressing these bottlenecks. Utilities must be empowered and incentivized 
to strategically invest in infrastructure aligned with national economic and technological 
priorities. Moreover, the Trump Administration should explore implementing  single -
window authorities, shot clocks, and preemption  to facilitate power infrastructure 
development to support  AI infrastructure  deployment . Such bold permitting  reforms 
have facilitated faster approvals for other essential commercial developments,  such as 
wireless /5G infrastructure,  and can readily be applied to the power sector . 
Ultimately, a robust power  infrastructure —encompassing expanded generation and 
upgraded transmission, supported by reformed utility business models —is foundational 
for securing America’s continued leadership in AI and other strategically important 
technologies. Policymakers must urgently prioritize comprehensive reforms that support 
the modernization and expansion of America’s grid, safeguarding economic prosperity, 
technological innovation , and national security.  
2.Build and maintain a robust and resilient supply chain for data centers
Supply chains and trade policies  play a crucial role in the operation and expansion of data 
centers and to AI. The importance of these elements can be understood through various 
lenses, including economic efficiency, technological advancement, and national security.  
Firstly, the efficiency of supply chains directly impacts the cost and speed of data center 
construction and maintenance. Data centers require a vast array of components, from 
servers and cooling systems to networking equipment and power infrastructure. Ef ficient 
supply chains ensure that these components are delivered on time and at a reasonable 
cost. Delays or disruptions in the supply chain can lead to significant project delays and 
increased costs, which can be detrimental to the competitiveness of data  centers and, it 
follows, to the  timely  development of AI infrastructure. This highlights the need for 
robust, reliable, and predictable supply chain management to mitigate risks and ensure 
timely project completion.  


Trade policy also plays a significant role in the operation of data centers. Public policies 
that promote free, fair, and certain trade on critical infrastructure components such as 
construction materials, electrical transmission equipment, generators, switchboards, 
chillers, switches, and server racks, among other categories, can significantly lower the 
costs of building and maintaining data centers for AI. This is crucial for limiting additional 
costs for data centers, especially those that aim to establish AI dominance.  
Furthermore, trade policies that promote the diversification of sourcing options can 
enhance the resilience of data center supply chains. By increasing domestic 
manufacturing capacity and diversifying sourcing options, data centers can reduce their 
relianc e on a single source of components and mitigate the risks associated with supply 
chain disruptions. Additionally, more competition within the industry can promote more 
product innovation and drive down costs . Through effective trade policies, the Trump 
Administration can create a more robust manufacturing base that provides more 
resilient sourcing options  for the da ta ce nter industry . 
Moreover, t rade policies that prevent bad actors from obtaining critical technologies and 
promote the development of domestic critical mineral resources and semiconductor 
manufacturing critical to data centers and AI can also enhance the security and resilience 
of data center supply chains , in furtherance of U.S. AI dominance . Through thoughtfully 
developed and implemented export controls that target specific high -risk uses and 
users , the Trump A dministration can effectively  promot e U.S. technological leadership 
while limiting access for bad actors.  By investing in and removing barriers to domestic 
critical mineral development  and semiconductor manufacturing , the U.S. can also reduce 
its reliance on foreign sources of essential components and enhance the security of its  
data center supply chains.  
3.Workforce development to foster faster and better data center development
Data center workforce development in the U .S. is essential for ensuring the efficient and 
secure operation of data centers . As data centers become increasingly complex and more 
integral to  AI development and other  important U.S.  industries, having a skilled workforce 
is crucial not only for  building the infrastructure as demand rises,  but also for maintaining 
the uptime, optimizing performance, and implementing advanced technologies such as 
liquid -to-liquid cooling. A well -trained workforce can effectively manage the hardware, 
software, and networking components of data centers, ensuring that they operate 
smoothly and meet the growing, more timely demands of businesses and consumers.  
Trades roles play a vital part in data center construction, maintenance, and operations. 
Elect ricians, HVAC technicians, mechanical engineers, and other skilled trades 
professionals are essential. Investing in a skilled workforce across both trades and 


technology sectors will not only create high -paying jobs but also ensure that data centers 
remain resilient, energy -efficient, and capable of supporting AI -driven innovation . 
To support this  goal , the Trump Administration should consider implementing targeted 
training programs that focus on the specific skills required for data center con struction 
and operations . These programs can include courses on data center development, 
construction, facilities management, cybersecurity, network administration, and 
emerging technologies like AI. By partnering with educational institutions, industry 
organizations, unions , and trade schools , as well as online learning platforms, the 
Administration can ensure that these training programs are accessible and relevant to the 
needs of the data center workforce.  
Another recommendation is to promote apprenticeships and on -the-job training 
opportunities within the data center industry. Apprenticeships can provide hands -on 
experience and mentorship, allowing workers to develop practical skills and gain valuable 
insig hts from experienced professionals. The Trump Administration can support this by 
offering incentives  such as tax credits or loans  to companies that participate in 
apprenticeship programs . This approach not only helps to build a skilled workforce but  
also fosters a culture of continuous learning and professional development within the 
industry.  
4.Increase network to reduce bottlenecks and develop data centers in rural areas
AI workloads must be connected to the global Internet to operate and have the 
bandwidth to scale, and there continue s to be vast swaths of the U.S. without adequate 
capacity and density of backbone fiber optic networking . 
Fiber optic networks and bandwidth are crucial for data centers, particularly AI data 
centers, due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data with high speed and efficiency. 
AI applications require rapid processing and transmission of large datasets, and fiber 
optics provide the necessary infrastructure to support these demands. The higher speed 
of fiber optic networks is essential for AI data centers, where real -time data processing 
and analysis are critical for tasks such as machine learning and pred ictive analytics.  
Moreover, fiber optic networks offer greater bandwidth, which is vital for AI data centers 
that need to manage and transfer massive volumes of data. High bandwidth ensures that 
data can be transmitted without bottlenecks, allowing AI algorithms to access and process 
information seamlessly. This capability is particularly important for applications that 
involve big data, such as natural language processing and image recognition, where large 
datasets must be quickly and efficiently processed to generate accurate results.  
Fiber optic networks also contribute to the scalability of AI data centers. As the demand 
for AI applications grows, data centers must be able to expand their network 


infrastructure to accommodate increasing data loads. Vantage is already responding to  
customer requests and requirements for 1GW+ campuses with “capacity to expand” in 
multiple locations in the U .S. Fiber optics provide the flexibility to scale up bandwidth and 
network capacity without significant upgrades or disruptions. This scalability allows AI 
data centers to adapt to evolving technological needs and continue to support advanced 
AI research an d development.  
Currently backbone fiber networks are concentrated in  and around  major metro areas. 
The U .S. must begin to encourage and support the development of more, denser  
networks into extra -urban and suburban areas and to bring networks to larger, stranded 
power sources and available land which could be  tapped for AI data center development. 
The Trump Administration should consider  policy mechanisms to facilitate  more fiber  
optic  network development , including  federal  incentives that can incorporated into 
urban growth plans at state and local levels . Providing financial incentives such as grants, 
low-interest loans, and tax credits to network operators and telecommunications 
companies can significantly reduce the financial burden associated with deploying fiber 
optic infrastructure in less densely populated regions. These incentives would make it 
more attractive for such  companies to invest in rural areas, ensuring that data centers 
and rural populations have access to  the global Internet in the bui ld out of AI 
infrastructure . 
Conclusion  
In conclusion, the development of AI infrastructure is crucial for maintaining the United 
States' leadership in technological innovation and economic competitiveness. By 
investing in power  infrastructure, ensuring robust supply chains, promoting workforce 
development, and enhancing network connectivity, the Trump Administration can create 
a strong foundation for AI advancements  in the U.S. and enable U.S. dominance  in AI  
globally . These efforts will not only support the growth of AI technology  but also drive 
growth and innovation, t hereby enabling freedom and prosperity . Vantage Data Centers 
is committed to collaborating with the Trump Administration and other stakeholders to 
achieve these goals and contribute to the successful future of digital infrastructure and AI 
leadership by  the United States of America.
