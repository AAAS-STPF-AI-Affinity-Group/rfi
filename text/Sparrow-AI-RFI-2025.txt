By going through with this you will kill what little is left of human creativity. I beg of you to 
think  of the artists, writers, makers who create their work by pulling inspiration from the depths 
of their soul. A way of life that has persevered for thousa nds of years, even now, in this era of 
soul sucking consumerist capitalist system. If this passes, then everything beautiful made by man will be replaced by machine, so that those men will have no other choice but to work to death whilst the creators of AI live perfect lives built on the blood of millions. DO NOT LET THIS 
PASS. PLEASE.
