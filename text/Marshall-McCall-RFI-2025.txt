Marshall McCall   
My name is Marshall McCall, and I am a graduating senior from Avonworth High School who 
has spent the past year studying the ethical implications of AI in creative industries, particularly 
in creative writing. Through my research, I have explored how gener ative AI technologies can 
change artistic processes, including issues related to authorship, copyright, and originality. I 
believe the AI Action Plan should create clear rules that encourage innovation while also 
protecting the rights of human creators. AI  has the potential to make content creation more 
accessible, but without proper regulation, it could harm creators' ownership of their work and 
increase inequality in the industry. Based on my findings, I strongly support regulations that 
promote transpare ncy in AI -generated content, ensure fair compensation for artists, and prevent 
monopolistic practices that could limit diversity in creative fields.
