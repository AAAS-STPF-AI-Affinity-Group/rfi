Subject:  NDUS Response to the Request for Information on the Development of an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan    
Date: March 1 4, 2025  
Introduction  
The development and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies present 
a transformative opportunity for the United States. However, it is crucial to ensure that the benefits of AI are equitably distributed across all states, including rural states like North Dakota. This response outlines the rationale for prioritizing equitable AI development and highlights specific initiatives in North Dakota that can serve as models for other rural states  and for the country . 
Rationale for the Broad -based Development of  AI Capabilities across the United 
States  
A national AI Action Plan should truly be nationwide, leaving no state or region behind.  
1.Economic Revitalization : Rural states often face economic challenges, including
declining industries and outmigration. AI can drive economic revitalization by
creating new job opportunities, attracting tech companies, and fosteringinnovation in local industries such as agriculture, energy, and manufacturing.
2.Educational Opportunities : Access to AI education and training can empower
residents of rural states with the skills needed for high -demand jobs. This can
help bridge the digital divide and ensure that rural populations are not leftbehind in the AI-driven economy.
3.National Security : Ensuring that all regions have robust AI capabilities is critical
for national security. Rural states can play a vital role in cybersecurity anddefense, contributing to a more resilient national infrastructure.
4.Innovation and Diversity : Diverse perspectives from different regions can drive
innovation in AI. Rural states bring unique challenges and opportunities that canlead to novel AI applications and solutions.


5.NSF E ngines  and EDA Tech Hub Examples :
a.The National Science Foundation’s Regional Innovations Engine s program
is specifically designed to broaden the innovation base across the United
States , taking advantage of talent that’s found in every state.
b.The Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration’s
Tech Hubs program  strengthens U.S. economic and national security with
investments in regions across the country whose assets and resourceshave the potential to become globally competitive in the technologies andindustries of the future.
c.These are examples of national plans for broad based development thatthe AI Action Plan could employ with great effect.
6.Rural Representation i n AI Governance Bodies . If the AI Action Plan
contemplates creation of  Federal  AI Governance or Advisory entities, rural states
should be afforded  equitable  representation from the outset by desi gn.
Rationale for Equitable Federal and Private Investment in AI Capabilities  
Unleashing innovation and investment shouldn’t be focused on existing technology geographies. All states have resources that can contribute to the effort. Federal and private investment incentives should be geographically equitable.  
1.Balanced National Growth : Equitable investment in AI capabilities ensures
balanced growth across the nation. By supporting AI initiatives in rural states, thefederal government and private sector partners can prevent economic disparitiesand promote uniform development [1].
2.Maximizing Talent Utilization : Rural states have untapped talent pools that can
significantly contribute to advancements in AI . Equitable  investment can help
harness this potential, leading to a more inclusive and comprehensive AIworkforce[2].
3.Enhanced Innovation Ecosystem : Federal support for AI in rural areas can foster
a more robust and diverse innovation ecosystem. This can lead to thedevelopment of AI solutions tailored to the unique needs and challenges ofdifferent regions [3].
4.Strengthening National Security : Distributed AI capabilities across various
states enhance national security by reducing the risk of centralized vulnerabilities.Rural states can play a crucial role in developing and implementing AI -driven
security measures[1].


Examples of Current Federal Investment in AI Capabilities  
Federal investment to date has been important for the development of AI. This 
investment should continue with an eye to expanding its reach to include rural states . 
1.National Science Foundation (NSF) : The NSF has significantly increased its
investment in AI research, with a focus on advancing AI technologies andapplications. For FY25, the NSF requested $2.05 billion, with a substantial portiondedicated to AI -focused research [1].
2.Department of Defense (DOD) : The DOD, through the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA), continues to invest heavily in AI research anddevelopment. These investments aim to enhance national security and developcutting -edge AI technologies [2].
3.Department of Energy (DOE) : The DOE supports AI research through its
national laboratories and research programs. These investments focus onleveraging AI for energy efficiency, grid management, and scientific research [1].
4.National Institutes of Health (NIH): The NIH invests in AI to advance medicalresearch and healthcare. AI applications in this sector include disease diagnosis,personalized medicine, and drug discovery [2].
5.Network and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD)Program : The NITRD program, established under the High Performance
Computing Act of 1991, continues to provide foundational support for AI and ITresearch across multiple federal agencies [1].
North  Dakota AI and Cyber Initiatives  
North Dakota is a thought leader in how to use AI to advance local, state, tribal, 
regional , and national priorities. We’re an example of how all states, including rural 
states , can contribute to the successful development of AI in the country . A sampling of 
examples includes:  
1.Mountain- Plains University Innovation Alliance : This Alliance was created in
2020 to harness the physical resources and intellectual capacity of the public
universities in Idaho, Montana,  North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wy oming.  This
existing Alliance is ready to contribute to AI research and applications on aregional basis, allowing our region to achieve the scale essential to AI initiatives.
2.Cyber Land Grant University Act : Chancellor Mark Hagerott of the North
Dakota University System has proposed the Cyber Land Grant University Act,
modeled after the Morrill Act of 1862. This initiative aims to establish a national


network of digital -cyber universities to democratize access to digital skills and 
address the concentration of technological expertise in urban areas.  
3.Cybersecurity Centers of Excellence: North Dakota universities, including North
Dakota State University (NDSU) , the University of North Dakota (UND), Minot
State University (MiSU), and Bismarck State College (BSC), have been accreditedas Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense by the NSA and DHS. Thesedesignations recognize North Dakota’s  commitment to cybersecurity education
and research  and our ability to contribute to national AI initiatives.
4.AI Institute for Teaching and Learning : Valley City State University (VCSU) has
proposed the establishment of an AI Institute for Teaching and Learning. Thisinstitute aims to integrate AI into educational practices, enhancing teachingmethodologies and preparing students for the AI -driven future.  This builds on
VCSU’s long-standing leadership and innovation in the development of the
education workforce.
5.National Center for the Application of AI in Technical Education : The North
Dakota State College of Science (NDSCS) has proposed the creation of a National
Center for the Application of AI in Technical Education. This center would focuson applying AI technologies to technical education, ensuring that studentsacquire practical, job -ready skills.  This proposal leverages NDSCS’ record of
success in training and educating the skilled workforce our nation needs.
6.National Security Crossroads Initiative : North Dakota is in a unique position to
boost and sustain AI -driven Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and counter UAS (C -
UAS) capabilities for national security. Geographically, this “crossroads” could link
up Grand Sky UAS test airspace near the City of Grand Forks and Grand Forks AirForce Base, a test site north of Highway 2, a test site at Camp Grafton TrainingCenter and the  airspace surrounding Minot Air Force Base.  Higher ed ucation  will
have a key role in UAS/C -UAS research, development , education, and training
resources. Six NDUS institutions in the Crossroads can contribute to this initiative :
Minot State Univer­sity, Dakota College at Bottineau, Lake Region State College,Mayville State University, the Univer­sity of North Dakota , and North Dakota State
University
7.Autonomous Systems Research and Development : The goal of the research
and development of AI -driven autonomous systems at North Dakota’s two R1
research institutions is to create new autonomous systems throughmultidisciplinary research and lead development of world -changing autonomous
policies, with the twin goals of driving a vibrant, diverse, and sustainable  U.S.
economy  and contributing capabilities for national defense. The University of
North Dakota’s Research Institute for Autonomous Systems  is a global leader in
unmanned autonomous systems research, application, and policy development.North Dakota State University’s research through its Agricultural Experiment


Station, its Ag Technology Project, and its Upper Great Plains Transportation 
Institute  aims to place AI -driven autonomy at the forefront of its agricultural 
research agenda.  
Conclu sion 
Ensuring that rural states benefit equally from the development and implementation of AI is not only a matter of equity but also a strategic imperative for the nation's economic, educational, and national security interests. The initiatives in North Dakota 
provide a blueprint for how rural states can leverage AI to drive growth and innovation. We urge the OSTP to consider these points and support policies that promote equitable AI development across all regions , including the investments made by the Federal  
Government .
