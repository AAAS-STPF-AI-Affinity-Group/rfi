General Comment
Allowing generative AI m odels to train on copyrighted data without perm ission is not only im m oral theft with significant potential knock-on
effects for copyright law in the future, it also does not fix the m any other issues with these m odels.
They will continue to consum e m assive am ounts of electricity and water resources to create nothing m uch of value.
Their outputs will continue to have no fidelity, forcing anyone who uses them  to look up inform ation to continue to fact-check any
inform ation they see, elim inating any point in using the m odel to begin with.
They will continue to be com pletely derivative of the data they're trained off of, m aking them  incapable of "creating" anything truly new.
And their public im age as a technology that's being forced into everything with no practical use or value will only worsen.
