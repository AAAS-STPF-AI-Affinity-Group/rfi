General Comment
I have no interest in supporting the ability for private AI com panies to have any right to train their program s with copyrighted m aterial. If
they wish to train their program s so badly, they can do it legally and with explicit perm ission granted by those whose resources they're
after. Generative AI as is relevant to the scope of this action plan has no place in the future of the United States, and will only serve to
replace the valuable jobs and labor of com petent citizens with content of subpar quality.
