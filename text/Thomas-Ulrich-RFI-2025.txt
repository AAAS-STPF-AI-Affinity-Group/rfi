I suspect you guys take most of these comments with a grain of salt. I am writing with a bit of a 
cynical attitude. It is safe to say, however, if you censure what I say, I wont ask anybody to sing a 
tune in my defense. Geesh In developing information for an Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence. An 
artificial intelligence action plan needs some straightforward pieces to work right: a plain goal 
saying what the AI’s supposed to do, a solid plan for getting good data it can use, a setup explaining 
the tech and tools it’ll run on, some basic rules to keep it fair and honest, a schedule with 
checkpoints to see how it’s going, and a look at what could go wrong —like if it starts acting funny or 
unfair. You’ve also got to say who’s building it, who’s watching it , and who’s using it, plus a way to 
tweak it when folks say how it’s doing. That keeps it humming along, doing what it’s meant to, 
without any big messes. Write a Digital Constution to keep the humans from screwing everything 
up. Write it for today and suc cinct enough to last 400 years +
