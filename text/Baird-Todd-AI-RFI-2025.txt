I am opposed to any government effort to waive copyright or sanction theft of produced work
or existing personal data or information just to make AI succeed. If AI cannot succeed withoutthis waiver of intellectual property law and individual rights, then its development is not worthpursuing at this scale. At this time this effort reads more like a giant welfare subsidy to AIdevelopers than the federal government investing in vital scientific research. If we need to cutfunds for cancer research, there is no way the government should be subsidizing glorifiedsearch engines. If AI is as full of potential as its proponents claim, then it can pay for itself, andpay for the data it takes to build the programs. This document is approved for publicdissemination.
