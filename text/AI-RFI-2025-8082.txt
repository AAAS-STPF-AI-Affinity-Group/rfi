General Comment
"Artificial Intelligence", m ore accurately called generative im agery, is software that necessitates skirting of copyright law and fair use in
order to function at its m ost basic level. AI com panies have been caught red handed stealing the creations of hard-working artists,
photographers, designers, writers, and essentially any other enthusiastic citizen inclined to creativity. The software they peddle has one
functional purpose: rem ove those people from  the m oney-m aking equation by allowing free or cheap generation of im agery for those
looking to save a buck. It puts hard-working Am ericans out of business and prom otes a laziness of thought and em otion that is detrim ental
to our collective consciousness. It is nothing m ore than a novelty, a parlor trick, dim inishing returns at the expense of our souls.
