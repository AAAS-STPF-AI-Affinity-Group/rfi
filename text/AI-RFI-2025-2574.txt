General Comment
The sum  total of hum an creativity is not com post to help grow plagiarism  m achines.
Support artists that need the funds to survive, give your eyes and ears to the people who create what these m achines m im ic. Give them
equal protection under the law.
Do not violate their rights so anybody with a big enough GPU can take a shortcut because they don't want to pick up a pencil and put
forth effort for once.
