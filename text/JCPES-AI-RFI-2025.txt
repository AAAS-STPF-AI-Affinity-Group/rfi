Re: Request for Information on the Development of an AI Action Plan  
The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, America’s Black think tank, provides 
compelling and actionable policy solutions to eradicate persistent and evolving barriers to the 
full freedom of Black people in America.1 As a trusted forum for leading experts and scholars, 
we engage in major public policy debates and promote ideas that advance Black communities 
through evidence -based research, analysis, convenings, and strategic communications.2 
As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly transforms the economy and workforce, its impact on Black 
communities must be a central consideration in national AI policy. The Trump administration’s 
recent efforts to bolster U.S. leadership in AI —including Execut ive Order 14179, “Removing 
Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,”3 and the proposed $500 billion 
“Stargate Project”4—signal a strategic push to maintain the nation’s AI competitiveness. While 
these initiatives focus on fostering innovation and economic growth, they must also ensure that 
AI serves as a tool for economic mobility rather than reinforcing existing bias and economic 
disparities. Without targeted policies, AI -driven automation could displace Black workers at 
disproportionate rates, widen the wealth divide , and limit access to high -paying AI -driven 
careers and entrepreneurship opportunities.  
At this critical juncture, the Trump administration’s AI Action Plan must take a bold, 
comprehensive approach that recognizes both the risks and opportunities AI presents for various 
communities . The following comments highlight (1) the economic risks posed by AI -driven 
workforce disruptions, particularly in industries that employ a high percentage of Black workers, 
(2) the impact of AI on the wealth divide  and the urgency of economic protections to prevent
further disparities (3) the ways AI can drive economic growth for Black workers and
entrepreneurs if intentional policies are implemented, and (4) policy recommendations that
ensure that national AI polic y prioritizes fairness, workforce resilience, and economic inclusion.

2By addressing these challenges, AI policy can be structured to promote shared prosperity —
turning one of the most promising technological advances of the 21st century into a technology 
that can bridge one of the most long -standing problems in the United Sta tes, racial economic 
inequality for African Americans.  
AI-Driven Workforce Disruptions: A National Competitiveness Issue  
The rapid advancement of AI -driven automation presents both opportunities and challenges for 
the U.S. economy. While AI has the potential to increase productivity and spur innovation, its 
unchecked deployment threatens to displace millions of workers, part icularly in industries that 
disproportionately employ Black workers. If not properly managed, this technological shift could 
widen the racial wealth divide, increase unemployment, and weaken the nation’s labor force 
participation rate —undermining the very economic strength that AI is meant to enhance. The 
Trump Administration's AI policy seeks to position the U.S. as a leader in artificial intelligence, 
but without strategic workforce planning and targeted policy interventions, AI could accelerate 
labor mar ket inequities in multiple key sectors:  
a.Transportation and Warehousing
One of the industries most at risk is transportation and warehousing, where automation is rapidly 
reshaping logistics, trucking, and delivery services. Black workers make up a significant share of 
this workforce, particularly in roles such as truck drivers  and warehouse operators. According to 
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 22.5% of Black workers in this sector face a high risk of job 
displacement due to AI -powered automation.5 Autonomous trucking and AI -managed logistics 
operations are already being tested,6 and as these technologies become more widely adopted, 
they could significantly reduce the demand for human labor, eliminating well -paying, stable jobs 
that have historically provided pathways to the middle class for Black workers.  
b.Retail
Similarly, retail jobs —where Black workers make up 12.5% of the workforce7—are rapidly 
being replaced by AI -driven automation. Self -checkout systems8 and cashier -less stores9 are 
becoming the norm, reducing the need for human retail employees. The United States 
Government Accountability Office warns that workers with lower levels of formal education and 
those in highly routine jobs —such as cashiers or clerical workers —are at r isk of automation -

 related job loss.10 Without proactive interventions, the automation of these roles will exacerbate 
existing employment disparities and further shrink economic mobility for Black communities.  
c. Administrative Support  
Administrative support is another key sector facing significant disruption, with Black women 
disproportionately represented in these roles. In 2024, Black women made up 15.3% while Black 
men made up 7.1% of the workforce in office and administrative suppor t occupations.11 
However, rapid advancement in AI is replacing many of these positions, creating a heightened 
risk of job displacement.12 This shift is particularly concerning for Black women, who often rely 
on administrative roles as a stable source of employment.13 If AI adoption continues without 
policies to reskill and transition affected workers into new opportunities, it will result in 
widespread job losses that disproportionately impact Black women.  
The larger economic impact of these disruptions cannot be overstated. A shrinking labor force 
participation rate, particularly among historically marginalized workers, will have cascading 
effects on consumer spending, housing stability, and overall economi c growth.14 If entire sectors 
of the workforce are displaced without alternative pathways to employment, the U.S. risks falling 
behind in global competitiveness by failing to fully utilize its labor market potential.15 
Additionally, economic instability among displaced workers could increase reliance on social 
safety nets, placing further strain on government resources.  
AI, the Wealth Gap, and the Urgency of Economic Protections  
The impact of AI -driven workforce disruptions cannot be fully understood without considering 
the existing racial wealth divide and the financial vulnerability of Black communities. Black 
households face severe economic insecurity, making job displacement due to automation 
particularly devastating. The median household wealth for Black families is just $44,890 —
compared to $285,010,200 for White fami lies.16 This staggering disparity in wealth accumulation

4leaves Black workers with fewer financial buffers to withstand economic shocks, including those 
caused by AI -driven job losses.  
Another way of looking at economic security is examining asset poverty, which is defined as the 
inability to sustain a household for three months without income.17 One study found that 44% of 
Black households are asset poor, compared to just 16% of White households.18 This means that 
almost half of all Black families lack the financial resources to navigate periods of 
unemployment, making job displacement due to automation an immediate crisis rather than a 
temporary setback. Without targeted interventions, AI -driven jo b losses will push more Black 
families into economic precarity, worsening long -term financial instability and deepening 
generational poverty.  
The consequences of AI -driven labor market disruptions extend beyond individual job losses —
they undermine pathways to economic mobility.19 Historically, middle -class job opportunities in 
transportation, retail, and administrative support roles have allowed Black workers to achieve 
greater financial security despite broader economic inequities. As automation eliminates these 
positions, there is greater opportunity for increased economic insecurity.  In addition, this creates 
new barriers to wealth -building, limiting access to homeownership, retirement savings, and 
upward mobility for future generations. Without intervention, the racial wealth divide will only 
widen as Black workers are displaced from stable industries without access to comparable 
pathways to greater economic opportunity.  
AI as an Economic Growth Opportunity for Black Workers & Entrepreneurs  
While AI -driven automation threatens job security and economic stability for many Black 
workers, it also presents a powerful opportunity for economic mobility —if access to AI -driven 
jobs and entrepreneurship are expanded with significant intention. AI is a lready driving job 
creation in high -growth, high -paying fields like machine learning, data science, and AI ethics,20 
yet Black workers remain severely underrepresented in these sectors. Additionally, AI -powered 
innovation is shaping the future of business and entrepreneurship, but Black founders continue to 
face significant barriers to capital and scaling opportunities.  Without intentional policy 
interventions, AI could deepen existing societal fissures, further limiting access to the wealth -
building potential of the digital economy. However, if AI policies are intentional and have a laser

5focus on education, training and increasing access to capital for all communities, this emerging 
technology can become a force for economic empowerment rather than exclusion.  
a.Bridging the AI Employment Gap: Expanding Representation in High -Paying AI
Fields
AI-driven job growth is concentrated in STEM fields such as software engineering, AI ethics, 
cybersecurity, and robotics, yet Black workers remain disproportionately underrepresented in 
these high -paying careers. Only 4.7% of software engineers are Black,21 and Black workers hold 
just 9% of all STEM jobs,22 despite making up nearly 13% of the U.S. workforce. 23 These 
statistics are not just a workforce issue —it’s an economic mobility crisis. As AI reshapes the job 
market, those with access to AI -related careers will benefit from increased wages and economic 
stability, while those without will face displacement a nd financial precarity. Without deliberate 
intervention, the racial wealth divide will continue to widen if Black workers are not included in 
the growing AI economy.  
b.Breaking Barriers: Supporting Entrepreneurs in AI & Tech Innovation
Beyond employment, AI is reshaping the entrepreneurial landscape, creating new opportunities 
for business innovation. From AI -driven automation tools that streamline operations to AI -
powered predictive analytics that enhance business decision -making, entre preneurs who leverage 
AI will have a competitive edge in the digital economy. However, Black entrepreneurs face 
systemic barriers to accessing the capital needed to innovate and scale AI -driven businesses.  
According to Crunchbase, Black founders received only 0.48% of all venture capital funding in 
2023, despite the explosive growth of AI startups.24 Additionally, “only 3.1% of startups that 
raise venture funding are Black -owned, and Black startups receiving funding raise half as much 
as others.”25 This chronic underinvestment in Black entrepreneurship prevents many Black 
innovators from building and scaling AI -powered businesses, limiting their participation in the 
AI economy.  
c.Building AI Workforce Resilience Through Education & Training
As AI continues to reshape the job market, investing in AI workforce training is essential to 
ensuring economic prosperity for all communities. Many AI -driven roles require specialized 
skills, but without increased access to AI education, Black workers wil l remain 
disproportionately impacted by automation. To combat this, policymakers must expand AI

Policy Recommendations to Ensure Inclusive AI Development  
In light of President Trump’s recent initiatives to bolster U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence 
(AI), including the signing of Executive Order 14179, “Removing Barriers to American 
Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” and the announcement of the $500 billion “Stargate 
Project” aimed at massive AI infrastructure investment, it is imperative to align policy 
recommendations that address AI -driven workfor ce disruptions and promote economic 
prosperity for African American workers. While these initiatives focus on maintaining U.S. 
competitiveness in AI, they must also ensure that technological advancements contribute to 
economic mobility rather than reinforc ing existing issues.  
The following policy recommendations are designed to integrate workforce resilience, STEM 
education, entrepreneurship, and AI accountability into the administration’s AI action plan to 
ensure Black communities are a part of the nation’s economic growth:  
1. Integrate Workforce Impact Assessments into AI Initiatives  
With the administration’s focus on AI deployment, it is crucial to proactively address workforce 
disruptions and create pathways to employment for those at risk of displacement.  
● Conduct Comprehensive Workforce Impact Assessments : Before implementing AI -
driven automation, federal agencies must assess job displacement risks where there could 
be a disproportionate impact on  Black workers and other economically vulnerable 
groups.. These assessments should inform targeted policy inte rventions.  
● Develop AI Workforce Transition Plans : Establish strategic reskilling and transition 
programs that retrain affected workers, ensuring they have clear pathways into high -
demand AI -driven industries.  
● Ensure AI -Related Job Growth Includes Underrepresented Groups : As AI reshapes the 
labor market, policies must incentivize hiring practices in AI -related fields to ensure 
underrepresented workers such as African Americans gain pathways to newly created 
jobs.  
2. Establish the AI Workforce Resilience Program  
To mitigate risks of job displacement and ensure economic mobility, the administration should 
launch a federal AI Workforce Resilience Program focused on training, apprenticeships, and 
reskilling initiatives.  
● Expand Reskilling Initiatives : Invest in federally funded training programs that equip      
workers with skills relevant to AI -resistant industries, such as cybersecurity, healthcare, 
and energy.  


7 
 ● Create Apprenticeship & Certification Opportunities : Partner with universities, 
community colleges, and vocational training institutions to develop AI -focused 
apprenticeships and technical certification programs, ensuring impacted workers are 
positioned to thrive in the AI economy.  
● Incentivize Private Sector AI Workforce Development : Provide tax incentives for 
corporations that implement AI hiring, upskilling, and retraining initiatives focused on 
expanding participation in AI -driven roles particularly for those from economically 
vulnerable communities.  
3. Increase Investment in AI & STEM Education  
To close the AI skills gap and increase Black representation in AI -driven fields, early and 
sustained investment in education is necessary.  
● Enhance Funding for Colleges, Universities and Vocational Schools : Allocate federal 
funding for AI and STEM education programs to all colleges and universities to develop 
robust AI curricula, research programs, and technical training hubs.  
● Implement AI & Digital Literacy in K -12 Schools : Introduce AI, coding, and digital 
literacy courses early in the education pipeline, particularly in underserved communities, 
to build foundational skills and expose all students to AI career paths.  
● Launch AI Research Fellowships & Scholarships : Establish federal AI research 
fellowships, STEM scholarships, and funding opportunities targeted at students pursuing 
AI-related fields, ensuring distinct participation in the future AI workforce.  
4. Promote AI Entrepreneurship  
AI is reshaping industries and creating new business opportunities, but African American 
entrepreneurs remain severely underfunded and underrepresented in AI -driven startups. 
Expanding access to capital and support systems is crucial to ensuring Black innovators can 
participate in AI entrepreneurship.  
● Provide Access to AI Startup Capital : Establish federal AI business grants, low -interest 
loans, and investment funds that includes African American entrepreneurs and AI -driven 
small businesses.  
● Develop AI Innovation Hubs in Lower -Income Communities : Fund AI business 
incubators and accelerators focused on supporting AI startups, providing mentorship, 
networking, and access to cutting -edge AI technology to lower -income communities.  
● Ensure Federal AI Procurement Supports Entrepreneurs : Mandate that a percentage of 
federal AI contracts and procurement opportunities be allocated to start -up AI businesses, 
ensuring intentional participation in government -backed AI initiatives and ensuring that 
underrepresented groups like African American s are not left out of this investment.  
Conclusion  
As the Trump administration advances its AI agenda, it must ensure that AI innovation drives 
economic prosperity rather than exacerbates existing economic disparities. Policies must not only 


8prepare Black workers for AI -driven disruptions but also create pathways to AI -related 
employment and entrepreneurship. By integrating workforce resilience, STEM education, 
business investment, and AI accountability into the AI action plan, the U.S. can re tain its global 
AI leadership while fostering inclusive economic growth.  
These policy recommendations align AI -driven innovation with national competitiveness, 
ensuring that African American workers, entrepreneurs, and students have a stake in the AI 
economy —not just as consumers of technology but as leaders, innovators, and bu siness owners 
shaping its future.
