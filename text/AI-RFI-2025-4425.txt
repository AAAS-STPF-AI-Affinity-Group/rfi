General Comment
I am  an aspiring novelist and Iâ€™m  devastated at the prospect of watching work I care about get replaced by AI or scraped to lim it and
stifle hum an creativity. AI also requires m assive energy that will cost greatly for Am ericans. We cannot allow AI to continue unchecked,
and require m assive regulation to prevent its abuse.
