General Comment
While m achine learning technology has m any potential applications in m any different fields, the use of this technology by OpenAI and
sim ilar entities to plunder the intellectual property and private inform ation of countless people at a scale this unprecedented m ust not be
enabled or allowed!
The avenues for rightful copyright holders to receive com pensation for their work's use in training data should be opened, and restrictions
should be placed on these entities accordingly.
This is to say nothing of the energy costs and ecological im pact of these m odels, which as of right now is highly inefficient and wasteful.
OpenAI and com panies like them  m ust at the very least be held accountable for these practices, and I should hope the proper actions are
being taken to that end.
Thank you, and God bless.
P.S. Also them  switching from  a non-profit to a private corp is super scum m y! What's up with that?
