General Comment
Do NOT a llow AI companies to willfully pilfer any content they deem useful to tra in their soulless prod ucts.
This is STEALING. As I understa nd it, stea ling is illegal in the USA for very good reaso ns - but in part icular, it hurts honest workers who 
are tr ying to make a living off what they pro vide. This app lies not only to s hopkeepers a nd other peop le selling tangible things, but also to 
creators of wonderful, inspired co ntent - art ists, musicians, writers, e ven pro grammers! 
By giving AI compan ies the power to suck up whatever they like and spit out thou ghtless garbage, it jeopardises the lives of real 
people  who do real work. This isn't a new Industrial Revolution, th is is strai ght-up theft, and th is &^% techbro evan gelism needs to 
be quashed  NOW. It's already having a significant negative impact on REAL people, and it's on ly going to get much worse if this 
disgusting 'rob from the poor and give to the rich' pol icy is introduced.
