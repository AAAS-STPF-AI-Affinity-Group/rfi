General Comment
Com m enting would not seem  to m atter given the level of ignorance it takes to even propose this. Out of every hubristic decision m ade by
this adm inistration, this is the m ost dire, and is certain to lead to ruin when the private sector is granted license to run am ok by the federal
governm ent. We have im posed lim itations on research for a reason, and people who do not understand why those lim itations are
necessary do not have the m oral right to rem ove them . Many would com pare this to an opening of Pandoraâ€™s box, but with how watered
down this m etaphor has becom e it would be m ore apt to com pare this order to the OceanGate subm arine.
