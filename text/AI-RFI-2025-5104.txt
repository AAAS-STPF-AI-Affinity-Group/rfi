General Comment
This is a horrible idea. Many of m y friends are independent artists who struggle to m ake a living as is in the current econom y. Allowing
their work to be stolen legally will only benefit corporations and harm  individuals. Not to m ention the energy costs that will inevitably com e
with the increased use of AI if this plan is carried out.
