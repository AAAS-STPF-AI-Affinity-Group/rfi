General Comment
OpenAI should be subject to exactly the sam e copyright restrictions as any other com pany. If their tech can only work by being trained on
IP owned by others, they need to work out licensing agreem ents and pay for that IP. 
I would like to see OpenAI restricted from  sim ply scraping content online and sorting it out later. It seem s absurd that they should get a
pass when a YouTuber posting gam e criticism  can have their videos rem oved for copyright infringem ent. 
The governm ent should be doing far m ore to regulate and restrict AI, not clear the way for them . If they want our content, they can pay.
