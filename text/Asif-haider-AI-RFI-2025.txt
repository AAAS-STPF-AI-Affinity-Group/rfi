Introduction & Statement of Intent 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands at a critical juncture where 
continued innovation must be balanced with robust privacy, 
security, and transparency measures. The Executive Order 
emphasizes the need to remove barriers to AI innovation  while 
maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security . 
This document addresses those objectives by proposing 
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)  as a lightweight, scalable  security 
and privacy framework that enhances AI without imposing the 
heavy compliance and regulatory burdens often associated with 
traditional oversight models. 
The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Networking 
and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) 
Program’s AI Action Plan underscores key areas: ●Data Privacy : Safeguarding sensitive information.
●Security : Protecting AI systems against threats.
●Efficiency : Ensuring large-scale AI operations remain
cost-effective.
●Regulatory Harmonization : Encouraging solutions that do not
unnecessarily hinder innovation or create duplicative
oversight.
ZKPs allow one party to prove a statement about data without 
revealing  the underlying data itself. Originally developed 
within cryptography, ZKPs are well-suited to verifying AI model 
performance, compliance, and integrity  in a manner that 
preserves confidentiality  and minimizes compliance overhead . 
Statement of Intent : 
This policy proposal aims to show how federal agencies, 
industry, and academia  can leverage ZKPs in AI development, 
deployment, and governance. We propose non-regulatory , 
incentive-based approaches to encourage ZKP adoption—aligning 
3 


with the Executive Order’s goal of removing barriers to 
innovation while safeguarding national leadership in AI. 
AI Privacy & Security Without Regulatory Burdens 
As AI systems scale, so do concerns over data privacy and system 
integrity. Whether it is GDPR in Europe or various data 
protection laws in the United States, organizations often face a 
patchwork  of regulatory requirements. This complexity can slow 
innovation : 
●Excessive Audits & Compliance : Traditional compliance
frameworks often demand detailed disclosures  of datasets
and model internals.
●Interoperability Gaps: Varying regulations create barriers
to deploying AI solutions across borders or industries.
●Resource Constraints : Smaller firms find the compliance
burden disproportionately heavy, discouraging them from
investing in cutting-edge AI.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs are cryptographic protocols that allow a 
prover to demonstrate the truth of a statement  to a verifier 
without revealing how that statement is true or exposing 
sensitive underlying data. In the AI context, this capability 
offers several benefits: 
1. Privacy Assurance : Organizations can prove they handle data
according to compliance standards—e.g., HIPAA,
FISMA—without revealing patient information or proprietary
IP.2. Regulatory Streamlining : Instead of requiring manual audits
of raw datasets, regulators could accept ZKP-based
certifications. This drastically lowers the compliance
burden.
4 


3. Cross-Border Data Sharing : ZKPs can abstract away
jurisdictional complexities by focusing on verifiable
compliance claims (e.g., “This model meets EU privacy
standards”), which fosters international AI collaboration .
Recommendations for Policy 
●Adopt Voluntary, ZKP-Based Compliance Pilots : Encourage
federal agencies to implement pilot programs where ZKP
proofs can substitute for detailed data-sharing in
compliance audits.
●Promote Public-Private Collaboration : Industry, academia,
and government labs can co-develop ZKP frameworks  that
align with existing regulatory standards like ISO 27001 or
NIST Privacy Framework.
●Tax Incentives for ZKP R&D: Consider offering research tax
credits specifically for developing or integrating ZKPs
into AI workflows, thereby accelerating adoption.
By placing ZKPs at the core of privacy and security strategies, 
federal policy can reduce red tape and unleash AI innovation —all 
while upholding rigorous data protection principles. 
ZKP for AI Security and Model Assurance 
Modern AI systems face threats on multiple fronts: 
●Data Poisoning : Malicious actors can insert corrupted or
misleading data into training sets, compromising model
outputs.
●Adversarial Attacks : Sophisticated techniques can
manipulate input data (e.g., subtle pixel changes in
images) to mislead AI systems.
5 


●Inference Extraction : Attackers may query an AI model to
reverse-engineer its underlying parameters, exposing
proprietary information.
How ZKPs Strengthen Model Integrity 
ZKPs address these vulnerabilities by enabling provable 
assurances  of AI model integrity: 
1. Model Integrity Proofs : Developers can create cryptographic
commitments  tied to a model’s parameters at deployment.
ZKPs then allow users to verify that a model has not been
tampered with or replaced.
2. Secure Model Updates : When a model is updated or retrained,
ZKP can confirm that legitimate updates  were performed
according to authorized processes—no hidden modifications
allowed.
3. Ownership and Licensing : ZKPs can prove a party holds valid
rights to a model’s weights or architecture without
revealing the sensitive details themselves, curbing IP
theft risks.
Policy Recommendation: Incentivize ZKPs in AI Security 
Frameworks 
A key step toward voluntary, non-regulatory  adoption is the 
creation of incentives  and technical guidance: 
●Guidance Documents : NIST, in collaboration with industry,
can publish best-practice guidelines  for using ZKPs to
fortify AI models.
●Voluntary Certification : An official “ZKP-Ready” seal or
certification could be introduced, signaling a model meets
certain security thresholds without  forcing regulatory
mandates.
●Procurement Preferences : Federal agencies could grant
priority  in procurement decisions to AI solutions that use
6 


ZKPs for model assurance, incentivizing broader industry 
adoption. 
Such measures would bolster AI’s security posture while 
preventing heavy-handed regulation  that could stifle the growth 
of America’s AI ecosystem. 
Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)  
The proposed AI and ZKP technologies are currently at TRL 4-7, 
indicating that they are near-commercialization but require 
additional development and testing. By focusing on technologies 
that are close to market, this proposal ensures that the AI and 
ZKP solutions will be deployed rapidly in real-world production 
environments. 
To bring these technologies to full deployment, the project will 
emphasize pilot testing, scaling, and optimization across 
multiple manufacturing sites. The goal is to move from initial 
development and testing at TRL 4 to broader deployment and 
integration, with a clear roadmap for commercialization and 
industry-wide adoption. 
   Energy Efficiency & AI Infrastructure 
AI’s exponential growth requires massive computation, from data 
center operations  to model training . This demand raises concerns 
about energy consumption, carbon footprint, and associated 
operational costs. Many U.S. data centers already account for a 
significant percentage  of national energy usage, creating an 
urgent need for sustainable solutions . 
Although ZKPs were traditionally considered computationally 
expensive , modern breakthroughs—such as zk-SNARKs  
(Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) 
7 


and zk-STARKs —are dramatically reducing  computational overhead. 
When properly integrated, ZKPs can optimize  AI operations: 
1. Selective Disclosure : Instead of running full-blown audits
or duplicating data, AI systems can produce ZKP proofs  that
reduce the need for repeated computations.
2. Batch Verification : ZKP schemes can verify multiple
transactions or model inferences  in one succinct proof,
saving energy across large-scale AI services.
3. Edge Computing : ZKPs can facilitate lightweight
verification  on edge devices, minimizing back-and-forth
communication with data centers.
Policy Recommendation: R&D Investment in ZKP for Sustainable AI 
●Targeted Funding : Federal R&D grants for ZKP-based AI
systems that explicitly emphasize energy-efficient
protocols  (e.g., HPC labs collaborating with cryptographic
researchers).
●Infrastructure Upgrades : Incentivize the retrofitting  of
existing data centers to incorporate hardware-level
acceleration for ZKPs, ensuring alignment with the
Department of Energy’s efficiency standards.
●Public-Private Partnerships : Encourage demo projects  that
showcase real-world improvements in energy usage and carbon
footprint  when ZKPs are part of AI workflows.
Aligning energy policy with advanced cryptographic techniques 
helps sustain AI’s growth while respecting environmental 
imperatives. 
ZKP in AI Governance & International Collaboration 
AI governance frameworks—both domestic and 
international—struggle with balancing transparency and corporate 
confidentiality . Nations differ in privacy laws, creating 
barriers  to cross-border AI deployments. Meanwhile, global 
8 


concerns about AI’s impact  on jobs, security, and data 
sovereignty intensify demands for common governance standards . 
ZKPs for Trust-Building Across Borders 
By design, ZKPs enable stakeholders to verify  compliance and 
model claims without disclosing  sensitive or proprietary 
details. This capability is vital for building mutual trust 
among nations with varying regulatory and cultural norms: 
●Regulatory Sandboxes : Countries can collaborate on
ZKP-based “sandbox” environments  where AI tools from
multiple jurisdictions are tested under shared verification
protocols.
●Uniform Verification Layer: A common ZKP-based layer could
unify compliance checks for data protection (e.g.,
verifying no personally identifiable information is
mishandled) even if local laws differ.
●Interoperable Standards : International bodies such as ISO
could adopt ZKP guidelines  for AI governance, streamlining
cross-border data flows and regulatory acceptance.
Policy Recommendation: Integrate ZKP in AI Governance Policies 
●Bilateral & Multilateral Agreements : Encourage the
integration of ZKP-based auditing  in trade agreements
focused on technology and digital goods.
●Global Forums : Use organizations like the OECD, WTO, and G7
to advocate for cryptographic proof mechanisms  as a
standard best practice in AI governance.
●Funding Mechanisms for Joint Research : Allocate specific
funds within international science cooperation  budgets to
support cross-border ZKP research (e.g., U.S.-E.U.
collaborative grants).
9 


Such initiatives help position the United States as both a 
global leader in AI and a pioneer in cryptography-driven 
governance. 
AI Workforce Development & Education  
Despite AI’s growth, a notable skills gap persists: not enough 
professionals are trained in cryptography, privacy engineering, 
and secure AI. This shortage hampers the adoption of advanced 
privacy solutions like ZKPs. 
Integrating ZKP into AI Education 
To keep the U.S. AI workforce globally competitive, federal and 
state educational policies  must adapt: 
1. Curriculum Updates : Revise AI-related courses (e.g., 
computer science, data science, cybersecurity) to include 
modules on ZKPs—covering theory and practical deployment. 
2. Hands-On Labs: Encourage the development of open-source  ZKP 
libraries and lab exercises, allowing students to 
experiment with real-world cryptographic code. 
3. Cross-Disciplinary Training : Combine AI, cryptography, and 
policy studies, producing graduates who can navigate 
technical, legal, and governance aspects of AI adoption. 
Policy Recommendation: Federal Funding for ZKP Education 
● Grant Programs : Direct agencies like the NSF to prioritize 
grants for academic programs that expand ZKP courses or 
labs in AI curricula. 
● Fellowships & Internships : Establish joint fellowships  
between government agencies (e.g., DARPA) and industry to 
train students specifically on privacy-preserving AI. 
● Professional Certification : Work with industry associations 
(e.g., CompTIA, ISC^2) to create a ZKP specialization  
certification that meets both commercial and government 
needs.

By boosting ZKP literacy among AI professionals, we ensure the 
sustained growth  of a privacy- and security-focused AI 
ecosystem.
