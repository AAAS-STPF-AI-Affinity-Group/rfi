Re: Reques t for Information on the Development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
(7555-01-P) 
Dear Ki rk Dohne, 
On behalf of AI LA's Responsible AI Reading Group, a community in Los Angeles composed of 
AI academics, professionals, subject matter experts, and enthusiasts focused on Responsible AI, we appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback on the development of the Development 
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. Our collective expertise and ongoing discussions have 
led to several key recommendations that we believe will help ensure the United States remains 
a global leader in AI while promoting innovation, security, and economic growth. 
Strengthening U.S. AI Leadership through Infrastructure Investment: A recurring concern 
among our community is the insufficient investment in AI infrastructure, including compute 
capacity, data centers, and hardware development. To maintain global leadership, the U.S. 
must prioritize: 
●Government -backed AI compute infrastructure: The federal government should establish
sovereign AI compute resources to prevent private-sector monopolization from
constraining innovation.
●Investment in AI chips and energy -efficient computing: Addressing AI’s energy
consumption and improving model efficiency is essential for long-term sustainability and
competitiveness.
Addressing Regulatory Uncertainty and Data Governance: Our community has identified the lack of clear AI data usage policies as a major barrier to U.S. AI leadership. To foster an 
innovation-friendly regulatory environment, the AI Action Plan should:  
●Establish standardized AI governance policies to provide businesses and researcherswith clear guidelines on data privacy, intellectual property ownership, and security bestpractices.
●Strengthen U.S. AI data policies to ensure transparent, ethical, and secure data usagewhile supporting public -private collaboration that balances innovation with privacy
protections.


National Security, Cybersecurity, and AI Safety: Ensuring AI security and resilience against 
adversarial threats is a top priority. We emphasize the need for: 
●Cybersecurity -first AI development: AI systems must be safeguarded against data
breaches, adversarial attacks, and algorithmic manipulation.
●Investment in explainability and model assurance: To maintain public trust, thegovernment should support the development of standards for AI transparency and
robustness.
Workforce Development and Public AI Literacy: A strong AI workforce is critical for 
maintaining U.S. competitiveness. We highlight the need for:  
●Expanded AI training and workforce initiatives, including investments in education,upskilling programs, and research fellowships to build a robust talent pipeline.
●Public engagement to address AI skepticism, ensuring the benefits of AI are widelyunderstood and ethical concerns are proactively addressed.
Encouraging Open Innovation While Protecting National Interests: The AI Action Plan should strike a balance between open innovation and national security by: 
●Supporting open-source AI development with safeguards to prevent misuse whilefostering collaboration and competition.
●Strengthening export controls and international AI governance efforts to preventadversarial actors from exploiting AI advancements against U.S. interests.
Conclusion: To solidify America’s leadership in AI, the AI Action Plan must promote policies 
that: 
1. Ensure robust AI infrastructure investment  to sustain national competitiveness.
2. Provide clear AI governance policies that support responsible innovation.
3. Strengthen AI security and safety to protect against cyber threats.
4.Invest in AI workforce development and public education.
5. Support open AI development while ensuring national security.
Thank you for your attention to these recommendations.
