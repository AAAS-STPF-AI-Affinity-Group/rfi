General Comment
AI, in particular Generative AI and sim ilar form s of m achine learning need ADDITIONAL regulations to protect individuals and
businesses. Many of the m odels that exist today are built off of data that is scraped without the knowledge of the parties whom  have their
data/words/art taken.
The action plan as described will cause great harm  to ANYONE that utilizes the Internet in any capacity. 
Additionally, this plan will incentivize big-tech to create AI software that is prone to errors and bias. There is also nothing in this plan that
would protect children from  the dangers of AI in its current form .
The adm inistration needs to take a step back from  this plan im m ediately to protect individuals, businesses, and the free m arket.
