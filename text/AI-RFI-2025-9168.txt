General Comment
AI is a great tool for inspiration, but having it go unchecked and without copyright laws, people could have their work trained off of and
stolen or even be defam ed with deep fakes. Tech com panies would be taking job opportunities to those who deserve them . Without
regulation, the talented artists, photographers, m usicians, and countless others who have helped train these program s will find them selves
without jobs as m assive corporations find ways to weasel out of having to pay them  by having an environm entally harm ful m ethod of
creation do the work lifelessly, and at the press of a button.
This will also cause issues for those who create AI content. Many who do are already disliked. When an artist with a large following sees
that their art has been used to train som ething, and the AI creator is not legally obligated to credit them , the internet will do what the
internet does best. It will doxx, harass, and do anything to put these people in harm s way. It's best to have the precautions set up now
before the people take m atters into their own hands.
