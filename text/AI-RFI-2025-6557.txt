General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US as AI steals from  both m ine and m y friends' livelihoods and profits off of that theft.
As an Am erican, that feels unjust, unfair, and against the foundations of what m akes this country great. Finally I think AI is overhyped,
delivers substandard work, and is an attem pt by com panies to unfairly overprice their products.
