General Comment
I can not begin to explain how awful of an idea deregulation of OpenAI is. It will m ake of all the copyright infringem ent and theft that
occurs from  OpenAI go without consequence, and m ake creators lose out on m illions of dollars. The use of OpenAI is bad for the
environm ent and the econom y, and will only get worse if we do not protect ourselves and our work.
