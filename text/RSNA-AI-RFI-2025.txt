Re: Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan; 
Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) National Coordination 
Office (NCO), National Science Foundation  
The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) appreciates the opportunity to provide input to the 
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office (NCO), National Science 
Foundation, on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan (“Plan”).  
As the leading global organization representing over 52,000 medical imaging professionals across 150 
countries, RSNA plays a central role in advancing AI -driven innovation in healthcare. RSNA hosts the 
world’s largest and most influential radiology confere nce each November in Chicago, Illinois, drawing 
tens of thousands of radiologists, researchers, and industry leaders from around the globe. This premier event serves as the definitive forum for showcasing cutting -edge AI applications in medical 
imaging, facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration, and fostering public -private partnerships that drive 
healthcare innovation.  
Radiology and medical imaging are among the most data -intensive fields in medicine, and AI -driven 
technologies have already begun transforming clinical practice. Radiology has experienced the highest 
rate of AI tool development and deployment, with more than 76% of the over 1000 FDA -cleared AI 
algorithms designed for radiological applications. AI has the potential to significantly enhance 
diagnostic accuracy, streamline workflows, and improve patient outcomes. However, for these benefits 
to be fully realize d, it is essential to strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring that 
regulatory oversight does not become overly burdensome. RSNA supports policies that encourage AI adoption while allowing for necessary flexibility and efficiency in the r egulatory process.

2 Key Considerations for the AI Action Plan  
1. Fostering Trust Through Robust Validation and Transparency  
AI adoption in radiology and healthcare at large hinges on trust —among clinicians, patients, 
and regulatory bodies. To cultivate this trust, post- deployment monitoring of AI tools must be 
standardized, with clear mechanisms for evaluating real -world performance and safety. RSNA 
urges OSTP to include provisions in the AI Actio n Plan that:  
oSupport ongoing validation studies of AI models in different clinical settings.
oEstablish transparent reporting mechanisms for AI efficacy and safety.
oEncourage collaboration between regulatory agencies, professional societies, and
healthcare institutions to ensure continuous oversight while avoiding unnecessary
bureaucratic hurdles.
2. Encouraging AI Innovation Through Targeted Research and Development 
AI in healthcare is only as strong as the research infrastructure that underpins it. RSNA 
recommends that the AI Action Plan prioritize:  
oFoundational research to develop optimized AI algorithms capable of addressing a broad
spectrum of conditions.
oTranslational research to refine AI integration into clinical workflows while maintainingefficiency, quality, and safety.
oExpansion of data and reporting standards to enhance interoperability and support
comprehensive AI performance tracking.
3. Reducing Barriers to AI Adoption Through Smart Regulation and Industry Collaboration  
AI has the potential to improve efficiency and quality of care, but its successful implementation 
requires a regulatory approach that encourages —not stifles —innovation. RSNA encourages 
OSTP to:  
oStreamline regulatory pathways to accelerate AI approvals while maintaining high safetyand performance standards.
oFoster partnerships between industry, academia, and government to ensure AI toolsreach the clinical environment swiftly.
oEnsure that AI regulation is adaptable to the fast -evolving nature of AI technologies,
avoiding excessive red tape that could slow progress.

3 4. Addressing AI Education and Workforce Development Needs  
As AI tools become increasingly embedded in clinical practice, equipping radiologists and other 
healthcare professionals with the necessary knowledge to critically evaluate, interpret, and 
utilize these technologies is paramount. RSNA encourages OSTP to:  
oDevelop federally supported AI literacy programs tailored for healthcare professionals.
oCollaborate with professional societies to implement standardized training andcertification pathways for AI competency in medicine.
oSupport ongoing education initiatives to ensure that providers and patients understandthe implications of AI integration in care delivery.
5. Strengthening Public -Private Partnerships for AI Development and Deployment 
RSNA has a long history of spearheading initiatives that drive technological progress in medical imaging. We stand ready to collaborate with OSTP, NSF, and other stakeholders to advance AI -
enabled innovation. RSNA’s contributions to AI development include:  
oLeading the adoption of DICOM imaging standards in the early 1990s, accelerating the
digitization of radiology.
oSupporting the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) initiative to improve
interoperability between diagnostic systems and electronic health records.
oDeveloping foundational semantic standards, such as RadLex ( https://radlex.org/ ) and
RadElement ( https://radelement.org/ ), that enhance machine readability of medical
imaging data.
oOrganizing AI challenge competitions since 2017, attracting global researchers todevelop and validate AI algorithms for disease detection and classification.
oCollecting, processing and annotating large medical imaging datasets for AI challengesand research ( https://mira.rsna.org/ ).
oHelping organize and supplying data to the Medical Imaging Data Resource Center
(MIDRC - www.midrc.org ), which aggregates and annotates medical imaging data for AI
research and validation.
To further the goals of the AI Action Plan, RSNA is prepared to serve in an advisory capacity, 
collaborate on data- sharing initiatives, and facilitate AI research through our established programs. We 
believe that by leveraging expertise from leading profes sional societies, policymakers can create a 
more robust and responsible AI ecosystem that fosters innovation while ensuring patient safety.
