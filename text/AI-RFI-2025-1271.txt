General Comment
So-called generative "AI" technology is nothing m ore than intellectual property theft writ large. The products it generates are subpar and
cobbled together using stolen data. The inform ation it offers is frequently incorrect or outright fabricated. It is a dying industry that only got
this far because of corporate interests seeing how it allows them  to destroy Am erican jobs and pocket m ore m oney by slowly poisoning
the Am erican creative landscape.
