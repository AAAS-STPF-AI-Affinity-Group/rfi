General Comment
Copyright is essential to protecting the livelihoods of creatives. AI com panies violated copyright, then claim ed they didn't, and now are
pushing to abolish copyright because they know what they did was illegal. This cannot happen. They need to be held to the laws they very
blatantly violated.
