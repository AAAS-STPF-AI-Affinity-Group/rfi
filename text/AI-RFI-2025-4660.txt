General Comment
With its intensive resource consum ption, generative AI does not have a place in the future of the US, particularly in the artistic fields. It
steals from  the livelihoods of Am ericans and profits off of that theft. Nobody could get away with infringing on intellectual property the
way generative AI does, and AI should not be perm itted to do so. Generative AI's place in the workforce and econom y is both unjust and
untenable; it will run its course and fall into obscurity. It needs to be curtailed in the process to prevent it from  doing even m ore dam age
than it has already done.
