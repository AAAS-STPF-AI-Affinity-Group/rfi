RE: AI Action Plan 
Submitted electronically via regulations.gov and email to 
Dear Mr. Dohne:  
The future of American healthcare and Artificial Intelligence (AI) stand at a crossroad. As 
AI brings transformative capabilities to health and wellness and promises solutions to 
long -standing challenges, we face a critical choice:  
•Embrace American innovation and creativity with smart oversight, or
•Risk stifling progress through excessive regulation of data and AI model
development/deployment.
Velatura Public Benefit Corporation ( www.velatura.org ) is pleased to submit  comments 
on the Request for Information (RFI) on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
Action Plan. We are enthusiastic about accelerating  AI adoption in healthcare w ith 
appropriate governance models that protect patients , families, and clinicians  – and drive 
entrepreneurship and digital prosperity. We support the Trump administration’s goals 
that expand the uses of AI in health care in favor of American innovation, economic 
competitiveness, and a light -touch regulatory regime.  
Our experience as the country's leading  healthcare interoperability  and Trusted Data 
Sharing Organization (TDSO) network , serving fourteen  states, has shown us both the 
tremendous potential and the practical challenges of developing, governing,  and 
implementing AI in healthcare settings. Velatura’s Digital Prosperity Initiative  (DPI) - 
rooted in our TDSO model and outcomes -based smart governance - is designed to help 
individuals and families organize, protect, and leverage their digital and data resources 


2 
 www. velatura.org |  to enhance resilience, preparedness, and overall well -being. DPI provides individuals 
and families with the tools and knowledge to ensure their "digital house" is in order, 
creating a foundation for long -term prosperity and security, starting with wellness  and 
health.  
The challenge we face is not  simply about managing new er technologies, it is about 
fundamentally rethinking how we govern AI in healthcare settings. Current approaches 
focus too heavily on restrictive data input and model controls that create unnecessary 
barriers between innovative solutions and the patients who need them. These 
bureaucratic hurdles add costs and complexity without guaranteeing better outcomes 
or measurable new value. Our experience across healthcare processes, systems, and 
governance model s has revealed a fundamental truth: the greatest challenge with AI 
governance is not  about data privacy, algorithmic bias, or model management. The real 
issue lies in how AI increasingly shapes critical healthcare decisions affecting all 
stakeholders in  the American  healthcare ecosystem.  
AI Censu – an Outcomes -Based AI Governance Framework  
Our American AI outcomes & a ccountability framework  shifts the conversation from 
process to outcomes and results. Instead of creating new bureaucracies to regulate how 
data is sourced or how AI models are  developed, we advocate for a system that judges 
AI by its impact on patient care and healthcare delivery. This approach, which we call " AI 
Censu ," (Latin for Decision) creates clear lines of accountability while preserving the 
innovation  and creativity  that drives American healthcare AI forward.   
In practice, this framework would work much like existing healthcare information 
protections. Organizations would track AI decisions with the same rigor they apply to 
Protected Health Information (PHI), creating secure, time -stamped records of each AI -
driven healthcare decision. The advantage of this approach lies in its practical simplicity. 
Just as healthcare organizations  maintain detailed patient records, they would secure 
these AI decision records, these "Censu Transactions"  in encrypted, immutable for m. 
This creates a clear chain of accountability without requiring creators to reveal 
proprietary AI methods or compromise competitive advantages.  
These "Censu Transactions" become a powerful tool for understanding how AI affects 
patient care , finance, and associated events , allowing for: 
•Monitor ing real-time outcomes


3 
 www. velatura.org |  •Identify ing areas for continuous improvement
•Shar ing best practices across systems
•Maintain ing clear accountability for decisions
An output versus input AI governance framework serves multiple purposes. It helps 
healthcare organizations improve their AI systems based on real -world results. It 
provides transparency and creates a robust audit trail that protects against errors while 
promoting continuous improve ment. Critical to this framework is maintaining the 
human element in healthcare decision -making. When care providers modify or override 
AI recommendations, these actions are documented to creat e valuable learning 
opportunities for  AI systems, healthcare professionals, and patients. This human -AI 
collaboration represents the future of healthcare —technology augmenting and 
assisting, rather than replacing, human judgment.  
The implications of this framework extend beyond individual healthcare decisions. By 
creating a dynamic ontology -driven way to track and evaluate AI outcomes, we establish 
a foundation for sharing best practices across healthcare systems while protecting 
proprietary information. This balance between transparency and innovation is crucial 
for advancing American healthcare. By implementing this output -focused AI governance 
framework, we can   
•Accelerate healthcare AI innovation without sacrificing accountability
•Reduce administrative burden while improving oversight
•Allow for backward analysis to identify root causes of harmful outcomes including
data, model construction, and model operations
•Protect patient privacy while enabling purposeful  improvements
•Ensure responsibility lies with the implementing organization rather than being
diffused through technical compliance
Economic Empowerment & Digital Prosperity with Health AI 
Our Digital Prosperity Initiative demonstrates how an AI Censu  approach can also 
economically e mpower individuals and families  in addition to bringing transparency and 
value . When patients understand how wellness, healthcare, and AI influence care 
decisions  or economic/prosperity implications, they become active participants in their 
care rather than passive recipients. This engagement leads to better outcomes and 


4 
 www. velatura.org |  more efficient healthcare delivery —goals that align with the administration's healthcare 
priorities.   
Through Velatura’s  Digital Prosperity Initiative, we have  seen how individuals – when 
supported with the right AI tools and education take control of daily health 
management; become active participants in their treatment plans; and build deeper 
connections with those treating them . When individuals have access to private or public 
funding opportunities, innovation sandboxes, and access to synthetic health datasets, 
they are also able to create disease -specific AI tools for their unique needs; share 
solutions within their communities; and create entrepreneurial opportunities in 
healthcare.  
This aligns perfectly with our AI Censu framework by emphasizing  
1. AI Fidelity: the value of health AI should be determined by its users  in their specific
context, not by distant regulators or institutions
2. Light -Touch Regulation: while organizational AI requires robust oversight on
outcomes, personal health AI tools created by individuals for their own use need
flexibility to innovate. Our outcome -focused governance model naturally accommodates
this disti nction
3. Individual Ownership: individuals who create personal health AI solutions should
retain intellectual property rights and economic benefits from their innovations
4. Open Innovation: Access to open -source AI platforms ensures democratic
participation in healthcare innovation without regulatory capture by large technology
companies .
Actionable Policy Framework  
The path to realizing AI's full potential in American healthcare requires a balanced 
approach that promotes innovation while ensuring accountability. Picture a healthcare 
system where doctors can freely develop AI tools to improve patient care, where 
indiv iduals create personalized health solutions, and where organizations can innovate 
without drowning in red tape. This is not  just a vision —it is an achievable reality through 
four  interconnected actions.  


5 
 www. velatura.org |  First, we must protect the fundamental American value of innovation through freedom 
to create. Just as early American inventors were not  constrained by excessive 
regulation, today's AI innovators —whether they are  physicians in rural clinics or patients 
managing chronic conditions —need the freedom to develop solutions that work for 
their specific needs. This freedom to innovate has always been the engine of American 
progress.  
Second, t his innovation must be balanced with clear accountability, which is where our 
AI Censu framework comes into play. Think of it as a digital ledger of AI decisions —not 
unlike how we track financial transactions or medical records. This creates transparency 
without bureaucracy, ens uring organizations take responsibility for their AI systems 
while protecting individual privacy.  
Third, f or those AI decisions that could significantly impact public safety —like diagnostic 
systems or treatment recommendations —we propose using blockchain technology to 
create an immutable record. This is not  about restricting innovation; it is about creating 
a foundation for trust. Just as America's banking system relies on secure transaction 
records, critical healthcare AI decisions need a reliable, transparent tracking system.  
Finally, we must invest in tools that help us understand and evaluate AI's impact. These 
assessment capabilities act like an early warning system, helping us identify both 
successful innovations and potential problems before they affect patient care. This 
investment ensures America maintains its leadership in responsible AI development 
while protecting public interests.  
Together, these actions create a framework that encourages innovation while ensuring 
accountability —a uniquely American approach to advancing healthcare through AI.  
A Call for Action  
America's leadership in artificial intelligence demands a governance approach as 
innovative as the technology itself. By focusing on AI outputs rather than burdening 
development with excessive regulation, we create a framework that serves both 
innovation a nd accountability.  
The AI Censu framework offers a practical path forward: clear accountability with 
minimal bureaucracy. It protects individual rights to create personal prosperity and 


6 
 www. velatura.org |  user -driven h ealth AI solutions while maintaining necessary oversight of organizational 
AI systems. Most importantly, it creates new opportunities for personal prosperity 
through AI ownership and entrepreneurship —hallmarks of American innovation.  
As AI transforms healthcare delivery, we have a unique opportunity to empower 
individuals, improve patient care, and maintain American leadership in this critical 
technology. The choice is clear: embrace an output -focused governance model that 
promotes inn ovation and personal prosperity, or risk stifling the next generation of 
healthcare breakthroughs with unnecessary regulation.  
Velatura stands ready to work with the Trump  administration to implement this vision 
of accountable, innovative, and prosperous AI development in American healthcare. The 
future of healthcare AI should be built by Americans, for Americans, with the light -touch 
oversight that has always encouraged ou r nation's enterprising spirit .  
We thank OSTP and the National Science Foundation for the opportunity to respond to 
this RFI, and we look forward to collaborating  with you to achieve American AI 
exceptionalism  and excellence in health care.
