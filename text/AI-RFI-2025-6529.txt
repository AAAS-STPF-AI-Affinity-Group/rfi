General Comment
AI training cannot be considered faur use of copyrighted m aterial. It is sim ply a m ethod of conveying the hard work and intellectual
property of artists into a form  that others profit from  without their consent. This is no m ore a transform ative work than painting your nam e
on som eone else's m ailbox. This is theft.
