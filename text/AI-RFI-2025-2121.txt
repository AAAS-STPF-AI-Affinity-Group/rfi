General Comment
Generative AI is an infinite theft m achine. An afront to what it m eans to be hum an. AI that im proves Healthcare diagnosis and actually
helps hum ans live and thrive is good! AI that steals the hard work of living breathing creatives is an abom ination and has no place in the
world.
