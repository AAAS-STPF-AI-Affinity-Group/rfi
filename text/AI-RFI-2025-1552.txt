General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to scrape copyrighted works without paying for them  will com pletely collapse creative industries not only in the
US but also abroad. These technologies barely function, are extrem ely overhyped, and only function through m ass theft and plagiarism .
They cannot be allowed to erase copyright law and the rights of creatives so that they can profit for free off of our work. I highly oppose
any actions that would allow AI com panies to access copyrighted m aterials without proper agreem ent between the parties.
