General Comment
This is a joke. This is a nightm are.
AI relies on work produced by the labor of artists to produce the value it offers, but it offers those artists no value in return. If artists had
the capability to steal from  corporations in that way, the perpetrators would be prosecuted. Instead here we are - requested to com m ent
on explicitly legalizing every form  of theft in the other direction.
This act will be the beginning of the disinform ation age. Every tool of wisdom  has now becom e a tool of hate. Welcom e to our new Hell.
