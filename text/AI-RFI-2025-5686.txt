General Comment
Generative AI is a solution looking for a problem . It is a m assive waste of resources and harm s the livelihoods of hum an creators, as well
as the environm ent, in return for shoddy, inane content.
Please protect the work of real artists, writers, m usicians, and other creatives. What they do is an im portant part of what m akes us hum an.
Their em otions and history and perspective m ake their output infinitely superior to anything a soulless com puter program  could produce.
Taking their work and using it to train LLMs without their perm ission is theft, plain and sim ple.
