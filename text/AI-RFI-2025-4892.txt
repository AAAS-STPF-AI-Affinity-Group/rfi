General Comment
AI is blatant theft and if it keeps being pushed and supported it will cause even m ore m isinform ation everywhere on the internet, it will
destroy the environm ent, it will destroy jobs for artists and writers, and it will m ake m edia you enjoy worse as m achines spit out 'content'
with no thought or creativity instead of real people taking tim e to craft art. Autom ation should be used for things that hum ans don't like
doing or can't do safely, not things that hum ans enjoy and are uniquely capable of doing.
