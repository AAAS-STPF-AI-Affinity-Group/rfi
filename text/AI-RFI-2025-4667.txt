General Comment
I am  deeply concerned about the plagiarism  aspect of AI and I will not use any AI trained on copyrighted m aterial - itâ€™s all fruit from  a
poison tree. If large language m odels are allowed to train on copyrighted works without paying for it it is a disaster for hum an creativity
and honestly abandoning our hum anity - I cannot state in strong enough term s how abhorrent this is to m e.
