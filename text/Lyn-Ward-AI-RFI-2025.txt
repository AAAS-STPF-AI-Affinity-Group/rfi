Allowing favored entities to use copyrighted material without permission of or compensation
to the copyright holders violates US laws regarding copyright protection, and it makes a jokeof any protests the US may make when foreign entities appropriate the intellectual property ofAmerican businesses and individuals.
  I am so opposed to this plan that there isn't even a word
for how angry it makes me, that my own government would consider allowing this. AIcompanies have the entire uncopyrighted libraries, film archives and museums of the world touse for LLM development and machine learning without stealing the work product of thosestill holding copyrights and earning a living from them.
In short,
  NO.
