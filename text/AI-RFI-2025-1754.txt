General Comment
This action plan claim s that “continued U.S. AI leadership will prom ote hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness, and national
security.”
In reality, AI technology has proven to stym ie hum an expression by condensing hundreds of thousands of artists’ work into hom ogenized
im agery devoid of m eaning; it’s proven to prom ote laziness in m arketing, spurring consum er disinterest and all but guaranteeing econom ic
failure; it’s proven to be a m ajor security risk due to how easily LLMs can have their initial param eters overwritten with m inim al effort or
wile.
Prom oting the developm ent of AI technology com es at the detrim ent of the Am erican populace, rich and poor alike. What is being passed
as a cost-saving m iracle technology is the latest in a long line of snake oils peddled by Silicon Valley, and will only further em barrass the
US on the world stage.
