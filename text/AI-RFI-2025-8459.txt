General Comment
It is not a m atter of national security to perm it a private com pany to destroy the foundation of copyright law in the United States. If their
business m odel cannot persist without the very basis of it being contingent upon the intellectual theft than they sim ply should suffer the
consequences of being reliant upon a tool that does so. OpenAI's goals are not in the best interests of Am erica.
