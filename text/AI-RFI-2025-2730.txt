General Comment
This plan will sell out the creative and academ ic rights of US citizens for the sake of a m arket that will not go anywhere/be profitable in the
long term . This plan will have an irreversible dam aging effect on the developm ent of the Jnited States' creative culture and m edia, and is
insulting to the arts and academ ia. The US is NOT for sale, including its citizens and their work.
