I believe any AI advancement should include guardrails to protect people with disabilities and 
other marginalized populations who may be harmed by datasets that do not accurately represent 
the non-monolithic makeup of our population. People with disabiliti es can benefit from AI, like 
dictation tools, but can also be harmed by automated decision making systems. The US Access 
Board and Center for Democracy and Technology have been working on this and should 
continue to be involved in any federal AI policy or strategy development. The US will never 
establish AI dominance if it leaves part of its population behind.
