General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  the livelihood of Am erican artists and profits off of theft. Why
does AI get to steal and give to large corporations setting them  up when the sam e corporations sue and take down anything that m akes
the sm allest sem blance to copyrighted m aterial they own?
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
