General Comment
This isn't even AI. It is not capable of thinking or reasoning. It is not able to understand context or rem em ber, because it is not intelligent.
It is not capable of continuing to exist, as it does not generate profit. If "AI" will die without stealing others' intellectual property, then let it
die. It is worthless.
