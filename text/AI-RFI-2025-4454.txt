General Comment
AI is not good at all.
Aside from  the (dangerous, at tim es) m isinform ation it spouts, creative industries m ay fire a lot of their workers. That prevents hum an art
from  flourishing, leads to higher unem ploym ent, and heavily reduces the quality and im pact of art. Other im ages it creates can also be used
to defile or spread m isinform ation about others.
AI should especially not be used in decision m aking, as a com puter cannot be held accountable for its actions. I do not believe it should
be used for security either, as it is possible to train it with a racial (or sim ilar) bias. 
Scraping also relies on stealing personal inform ation and/or intellectual property in order to function. I value m y privacy, and I guarantee
that I'm  not alone in that. Copyright laws exist for a reason, and voiding them  for an industry reliant on theft (and energy over
consum ption) is inexcusable. Terrible. Horrible. The rule of law should be respected by everyone, with no exceptions. And especially not
for thieves.
