General Comment
Artificial intelligence corporations and developm ent team s should not be given free access to all inform ation. Copyright inform ation should
only be usable by these groups with the explicit perm ission of the copyright owner. Shielding these com panies from  any penalties for
violating copyright or any other privacy regulation will only harm  in the long run, as no sm all creators or businesses will be able to keep
their inform ation safe from  Intellectual Property theft. This would also be a violation of personal privacy for anyone that does not expressly
consent to have their inform ation used by an artificial intelligence training algorithm . People's privacy and livelihood should be a higher
priority than any com pany striving to further a tool that is already used inappropriately by large corporations. 
Technology like AI should be created with the utm ost care and safety. Not by reckless business people who only seek to m ake m oney,
regardless of the safety of others. Loosening the already nearly nonexistent regulations on artificial intelligence developm ent would only
further steal from  those who actually deserve the credit for their work.
