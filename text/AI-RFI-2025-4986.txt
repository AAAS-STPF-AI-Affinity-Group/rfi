General Comment
The use of copyrighted content is theft, even in the use of AI. Rather a com puter is using the data to generate new data or not. Let m e put
it this way, if I download a m ovie. And then translate it to a new codec. Every pixel is the sam e. Every FRAME is the the sam e, yet it is
com pletely original data. Is that not piracy? No, the FTC would kill m e for sharing EVERY SINGLE FRAME of a m ovie. Rather it was
unique data or not. Sam e way if I would pursue an AI creator for publishing MY CONTENT in their m odel. Rather they m eant harm  by it
or not, it is copyrighted content that belongs to m e. That they are attem pting to profit off of. Do not let this happen, there are m any
industries that WILL peril in result.
