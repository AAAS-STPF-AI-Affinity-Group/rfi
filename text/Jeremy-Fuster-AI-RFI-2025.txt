Granting the request made by Alphabet and OpenAI will create potentially fatal burdens on
America's creative economy, risking our greatest cultural export at a time when other marketslike China are looking to not only develop their own theatrical markets but create a globalentertainment industry of their own. It will destroy all copyright law and leave countless artistsopen to having their work exploited and stolen. It must be staunchly opposed.
