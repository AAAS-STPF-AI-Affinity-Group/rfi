General Comment
AI needs to be tightly regulated and not allowed to run ram pant. AI should only have very narrow technical and scientific uses, but right
now it’s being used to steal data and copyrighted work it has no rights to. Am erica needs to focus on im proving living conditions for its
citizens, not lining the pockets of the ultra wealthy. It’d be better if AI were banned entirely than being allowed to run ram pant with no
accountability or regulation.
