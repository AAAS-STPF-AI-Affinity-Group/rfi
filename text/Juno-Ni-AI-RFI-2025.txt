Hello to whoever it may concern,
The page on the Federal Register about the AI Action Plan states that it aims to remove barriers to the development
of AI. This means copyright, as companies like OpenAI have long since been developing off of databases of artworkmade by artists and have already been facing trouble for it. Theft, and AI, have no place in the future of the UnitedStates, it is stealing from the incomes of millions of Americans, the environmental impacts will steal from thefutures of our children, and is a transparent bid to exploit and undercompensate those of creative industries.
