General Comment
Please STOP. Greed is ruining hum anity - we are m eant to create and innovate, not have AI do it for us. AI should search up m usic lyrics
and do m enial tasks, not devalue the beauty we can and do m ake. Please knock it off, I'm  so tired of having to com m ent on every god
dam ned bill passing through. Don't y'all have enough?
