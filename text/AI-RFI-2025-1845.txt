General Comment
Generative AI, in addition to having no practical use applications beyond putting artists and writers out of work as well as using staggering
am ounts of resources to function at all, is built entirely on the back of stolen content. If ownership rights of creative work are to m ean
anything ever again, this planet-burning plagiarism  engine cannot be allowed to freely steal the work of real artists in order to sm ash it into
the digital equivalent of paste.
"private sector AI innovation" is a hilarious contradiction of term s and if their business m odel requires wholesale theft of other people's
copyrighted m aterial in order to operate, it does not deserve to operate, period.
