General Comment
Hello
This is an extrem ely dum b m ove that will allow OpenAI to rip your stuff off and there's nothing you can do about it. Meaning if anyone
wants to steal your words, writings, or other stuff and m ake deepfakes out of it, that will be entirely your fault and there's nothing you can
do to stop it.
I would add how m uch this would hurt literally everyone, but it's likely the people who m ade this could watch their constituents be in a
SAW m ove trap gauntlet and watch with popcorn and indifference.
I extrem ely oppose this notion and I advise everyone else with com m on sense and a brain do the sam e thing.
