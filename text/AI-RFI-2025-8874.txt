General Comment
AI has no place in a healthy Am erican society. It is a product built entirely on theft, and true dem ocracies do not blindly m istake theft for
innovation, creativity, or social good. We are all of us m ore im poverished for generative AI existing - it bankrupts industries, erodes trust
in artists and m edia, and m aterially destroys everything it touches in its bottom less hunger for water, electricity, and com puter hardware.
The com panies begging to be allowed to continue their m ass theft unim peded are visionless swindlers and snake oil salesm en looking to
do nothing but siphon off as m uch wealth as they can, and are willing to hold the entirety of the tech industry hostage in order to do so. Do
not capitulate!
