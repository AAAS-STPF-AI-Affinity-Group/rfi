General Comment
This is such a gross overstep of AI com panies into avoiding any legal repercussions of their gross theft of Data.
What? If their AI gets a hold of m y im ages or m y writing? Or text?
Suddenly they can just steal m y very personal very private photos that will end up being used in generative AI?
Am  I going to see m y nudes used so they can m ake a profit, and I can't do anything about it?
This is com pletely unacceptable,
These com panies are going to m ake them selves im m une from  correct legal repercussions.
