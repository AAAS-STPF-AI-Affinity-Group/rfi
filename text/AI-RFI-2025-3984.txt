General Comment
Copyrighted m aterial should not be sacrificed to the AI beast you all seem  so eager to let run am ok. People who have put their ideas into
their creative pursuits deserve to have those ideas protected and should be able to profit from  them , not reckless and m orally bankrupt
com panies whose CEOs see no issue in stealing in order to m ake their product.
