General Comment
Copyright theft endangers artists, authors, individuals, and corporations. AI training on copyrighted data is barely disguised theft. We
cannot loosen restrictions on intellectual theft just because a com pany claim s a public interest, unless that com pany were developing a
public good. These com panies have not m ade such a com m itm ent and we should reject this change as a result.
