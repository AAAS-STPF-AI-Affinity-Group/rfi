General Comment
Copyright law shouldn't be cast aside for AI com panies to utilize m aterial that they don't own. To allow the recycling of copyrighted
m aterial through AI m odels would be to infringe upon Am ericans' intellectual property. It is also im portant to note that the absence of such
copyright protections would allow foreign AI m odels, such as those from  China, to also train on Am erican copyrighted m aterial. I am
opposed to this AI Action Plan.
