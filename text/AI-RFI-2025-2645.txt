General Comment
OpenAI should not have such power in the United States of Am erica. OpenAI's proposed im m unity from  copyright infringem ent sets a
horrible precedent for what can be legally stolen in the nam e of corporations, not the Am erican people.
I am  a full tim e freelance illustrator who does not consent to m y work being used by this technology in any way. This is theft com ing off the
backs of creatives and would effect m e as well as all of m y peers across our profession and beyond. Please do not do this.
