General Comment
I am  strongly opposed to this action. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. In fact, unregulated use of AI causes harm
to both individuals and com panies. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. Unregulated AI will destroy the
Am erican ideals of dem ocracy, artistic expression & free speech. This action is wrong, unlawful and m ust not be carried out.
