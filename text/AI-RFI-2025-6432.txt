General Comment
As a com m on worker and concerned Am erican citizen, I condem n the rem oval of restrictions on developing AI. It is possible to develop
AI with the safety and security of the Am erican people in m ind, but to rem ove all restrictions will allow developers to exploit intellectual
property and scrape scrabbled inform ation to generate m aterial that ultim ately harm s the public due to lack of oversight. We cannot allow
this to happen.
