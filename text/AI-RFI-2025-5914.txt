General Comment
How can we allow a corporate personhood to steal from  citizens? Citizens m ust be paid a fair price for the use of their m aterials and opt
in to the practice of training. Otherwise it sets a precedents that copyright is dead. Ownership is dead. If corporations can steal from
individuals then corporations can steal from  corporations. I can form  a corporation and steal all the intellectual property i want in the nam e
of training . How can this practice be sustainable? No intellectual property will be able to retain protections. The rights of citizens to
pursue a living and create capitalistic wealth will be effectively stripped. This is against free m arket principles. This is anarchy and
lawlessness and will destabilize capitalist growth in the econom y. Seizing property from  the creators and transferring ownership to a pirate.
Itâ€™s literally piracy. I urge a reverse course from  this ill-considered plan.
