General Comment
I strongly oppose m easures to rem ove 'burdensom e' copyright regulations on training data for AI m odels; it is a sim ple fact that the public
availability of a text to be *read* on the Internet does not constitute a license for its use in derivative works, and the argum ent of tech
com panies that their use of it should be perm itted seem s to boil down to "it's not stealing when you do this m uch of it," which is absurd.
