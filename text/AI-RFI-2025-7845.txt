General Comment
AI is theft. Intellectual property and copyright should not be used as training data. To replace jobs and art with AI would destabilize the
job m arket, and be used as an excuse to fire people. However, AI is not actual intelligence. It is a program  that does not fundam entally
understand what it is creating. It learns patterns, but can only reshuffle what it had been given.
Deregulating AI would also flood the m arket with art that would put artists in a place where creating anything new would not be som ething
they could profit from . New art would grind and slow, until the AI would be, by and large, training off of AI art.
But perhaps m ost im portantly artists should own what they create. And AI should not be able to violate that ownership.
Deregulating AI would be terrible for Am erica, Am erican culture, and Am erican jobs.
