General Comment
As an artist I don't believe com panies should be able to carte blanche steal what people m ake to feed into a plagiarism  m achine to m ake
nightm are horror im ages and writing. People own their work and it shouldn't be copied by m achines that can't understand what it's
replicating on a pixel by pixel or word by word basis. Generative AI is not the future, it will not help us, it will not save us and has already
proven dam aging to people's cognitive abilities. 
I don't want to engage in what Gen ai m akes. I want to read and see what people m ake. Creative work should not be replaced by
m achines.
