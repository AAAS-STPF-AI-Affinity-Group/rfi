General Comment
The essence of a creative work is the connection to the artist, a fellow hum an being who is revealing som e connection they have to the
shared hum an experience. Generative AI is nothing m ore than a thief who steals that connection and reduces it to a soulless m orass of the
least com m on denom inator. That is not even touching on the m assive environm ental cost that com es with operating the server farm s that
are necessary for AI products. AI is not worth investing in, all it will do is deprive artists of the opportunities to express them selves and
earn a living while doing so. To wave copyright law to allow AI m odels to be trained on copywriten works would be the lowest form  of
theft.
