General Comment
AI has no place polluting the workspace and is widely hated by the Am erican public. This directly im pacts m y work and the work of
thousands of others for features that none of us want. AI is being pushed on every platform  and every app and we want it gone.
The m ore AI grows the m ore AI cannibalizes itself
