General Comment
As a freelance film m aker and an appreciator of film  history, I can tell you that Artificial Intelligence will be a horrible investm ent, not only
for the Am erican people, but in general. Over the course of the history of film , there have been m any technological advancem ents that
have prom ised cheaper and better ways of film ing, and while som e have stayed, there have been som e inventions that have been forgotten
to tim e. A great exam ple was m otion capture, which was prom ised to be the future of anim ation, only for it to fall out of obscurity and
now only used in high budget video gam es. This pattern fits with the current state of artificial intelligence, both writing and visual. If any
m ore resources go into AI, it will be for naught, and it will only deepen the econom ic hole that the country is in right now.
