General Comment
Im  worried about the repercusions of this. As an artist, a voice actor, and m ainly as a person, I feel that allowing AI to take note of
EVERYTHING available is dangerous and volatile. We are already in a world where com panies are laying off hum an beings, Am ericans,
in return for lesser quality AI. In Art, Voice Acting, Music, even IT. If this extends to a further position without any kind of regulation or
lim its, I fear what will happen to the countries citizens. With this bill not only are Am erican jobs at risk, but Am erican IPs are as well. Also
with how open source OpenAI's API is I worry about what m alicious peoples will be able to do with that access.
