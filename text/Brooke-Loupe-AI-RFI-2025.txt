Hi,
I am a constituent from New Orleans, Louisiana. I do not like this AI Action Plan. We are not focusing on the issues
of the human scale, such as a rising unemployment status, a housing crisis, the high cost of living everywhere, thehigh cost of healthcare.
I don't find myself wishing the US had a more robust AI Action Plan. In fact, I wish we would pull the plug on AI as
a human race. It is KILLING jobs, not making new ones. What are humans going to do when everything becomesautomated? We will just be sitting there. The robots will be seen as useful and productive and intelligent; and wewill just be there? I do not understand this push. Please stop and focus on issues of the human scale or you will becommitting to IGNORING the working and poor class, IGNORING people struggle to achieve the "AmericanDream". AI is not American. It is not American made. It is a global evil headed by rich oligarchs with privateinterests to take themselves to Mars or something. I couldn't even guess their true motives, these people are a levelof evil I will never understand. They are the only ones who will benefit from this AI Action Plan. Please shift yourfocus to the issues of the people instead of whatever brings you the most money.
Sincerely,
Brooke Loupe
