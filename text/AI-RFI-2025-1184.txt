General Comment
My nam e is Michael Libbon and I am  a 2nd sem ester senior at Avonworth High School. I studied Generative AI and its im pact on the
banking com m unity for two m onths in a course on AI and Ethics this year. From  m y research, I think this current adm inistration's
Viewpoint on AI regulation is to progressively build on banking technology with the use of artificial intelligence. Establishing the use of
artificial intelligence within this com m unity allows corporations to safely m ove m oney quicker than ever before. Generally, the transaction
process for banks are slow. Incorporating AI allows system s to run sm oother at it reads and surveys transactions quicker. Banks use this
technology as a tool within the crim e departm ent as well. They can use generative AI to detect fraudulent activity within a blink of an eye,
which allows custom ers to feel safe and secure when using their m oney. Generative AI for banking industries is largely used as a tool now
in the year 2025 and corporations are spending billions upon trillions of dollars on this generational technology.
