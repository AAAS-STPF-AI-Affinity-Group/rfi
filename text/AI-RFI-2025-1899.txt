General Comment
This is not the proper use for AI. It’s supposed to be used to assist and aid, not entirely replace groups of people. You’re telling everyone
it’s okay to repeatedly take everyone’s property to train for som ething you don’t need such as m aking sure art and entertainm ent can be
m ass produced constantly to the point m any will grow weary and tired of new content. If you are worried about foreign entities, I doubt
needing copywritten works would be needed. Fighting an opposition like that needs the AI to be used for m ilitary purposes. Please don’t
over abuse AI for purposes such as this.
