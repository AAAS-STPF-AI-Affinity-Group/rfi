General Comment
I work as a product m anager in Software as a Service (SaaS) com panies that focus on field engineering and m aintenance.
As som eone working in tech, I feel that generative AI is overhyped. Som e 60% of queries answered by AI are incorrect in som e form  or
fashion, and adding training data will not solve this issue. Moreover, the environm ental im pact of generative AI will, if it is not already
doing so, take electrical power away from  Am erican citizens in som e of the least-served areas, and I do not feel that the current
adm inistration's plans to supplem ent power generation are going to help the ongoing clim ate crisis we're in. The so-called dem and for
better training data im pacts friends and fam ily who work in creative fields by stealing their (copyrighted) work and feeding it into the m ill of
"content" and regurgitating it on dem and.
In short, I do not feel that generative AI com panies should have access to private and/or copyrighted data without consequences, and this
AI Action Plan seem s to be geared to freeing them  from  those consequences. I do not and will not support this "action plan".
