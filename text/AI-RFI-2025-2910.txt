General Comment
As an artist in an industry which relies on a consistent and well protected copyright system  to survive, My livelihood is threatened by these
"Artificial Intelligence" com panies. Com panies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and X are trying to replace industry jobs using
technologies that require m ass illegal m isuse of copyrighted m aterial to operateb. No m atter what executive orders are in place under this
adm inistration, the foundation of private property rights to which this country was built around would be rendered useless if private entities
are allowed to take and use copyrighted works without perm ission of the copyright holders. If these "Artificial Intelligence" technologies
are of such high national security im portance that our laws m ust be violated to run them , why are these technologies in private hands?
There are other circum stances in which property rights have to be taken away for the betterm ent of the public good, but those are
procedures ran by public institutions which are supposed to be accountable to the people of this country. If OpenAI's theft of data is of
such national security im portance to protect, why is that data in the hands of an organization which falls under no governm ent national
security body? If the country suddenly had a m assive industry of crim inal thieves, should we m ake thievery legal to grow that budding
industry? I personally don't think so. Thank you you for your tim e.
