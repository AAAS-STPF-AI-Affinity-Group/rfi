General Comment
AI has its place and has shown to be effective in areas like m edicine and science where large data sets are gathered and are distributed for
the public good.
The sam e cannot be said for large language m odels and im age generation which take data from  copy written work in order to poorly
m im ic hum an creativity. These AI do not show a public good and seek only to inflate the pocket books of those who have invested so
m uch m oney into the technology falling into a sunk cost fallacy. These m odels has not shown to have m eaningful contributions to justify the
cost of operation. The restrictions are needed to protect creative works and copywriter.
