General Comment
I DO NOT support "rem oving the guardrails" on the developm ent of generative AI. Generative AI is not a necessary tool. I do not believe
that generative AI holds a place in the future of the United States. If the learning m odels for generative AI cannot be further developed
without unrestricted access to copyright m aterial, then perhaps those who produce the learning m odels should reevaluate their own
m ethods. Allowing generative AI learning m odels to have unrestricted access to copyright m aterial will only further steal the creative
output, tim e, and financial com pensation from  the original creators. The "tool" that is generative AI that the Am erican public is being sold is
unnecessary and far less capable than what the owners of the com panies would have people believe. Unrestricted access to copyright
m aterial SHOULD NOT be given to an over-hyped "tool" that has already been trained on volum es of stolen, uncredited, and
uncom pensated creative work.
