General Comment
AI should never be allowed to pursue any action that brings real harm  to hum an beings. It should not exist outside correct applications, it
is a tool that requires heavy and strict regulations with severe consequences for m isuse. It should not be used in m arketing. It should not
ever take the place of a hum an if a hum an is adequate or if a m istake could cause harm : A hum an can be held responsible, a program
cannot. It is infinitely harder to hold those who m isuse AI accountable if there are no strict regulations in place. Currently, AI is being used
to destroy hum an lives. Make it stop.
