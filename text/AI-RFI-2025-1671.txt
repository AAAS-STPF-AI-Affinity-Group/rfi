General Comment
We literally cannot afford eggs. I do not care if the President is tired of hearing it; I do not want m y tax dollars or governm ent focusing on
im proving AI technology. It is FAR from  the prim ary focus I want our governm ent to focus on, as we have folks literally being fired left
and right and everyday grocery prices are raising. 
We as Am erican citizens cannot afford everyday life expenses. This is not even touching on the ecological and ethical issues of AI. We do
not need or have to be the best at everything, I want us to be a functioning country.
Finally, IF we are going to put further focus into AI, I cannot em phasize how badly it needs to be regulated. There m ust then be a plan to
enact laws to prevent from  scraping data from  creators or published workers without consent, recognition and com pensation. 
Once m ore: I do not want the US to put any focus on AI technologies. We do not need to be the leading power when we can't even
support our citizens financially.
