General Comment
"Artificial Intelligence" is a program  of m ass-theft and m ass-degredation of Am erican lives. It does not have a future in Am erican life and is
m ost likely going to im plode within the next few years. Relying on and investing in "AI" will not only not benefit Am ericans; it will also hold
us back as a population. Students in particular will lose their ability to perform  com petitively with young people of other nations, because
AI reduces critical thinking and creativity in students. The only action we should be considering in regards to AI would be to shut down
opportunities for investm ent and ban AI com panies from  stealing the intellectual property of writers, m usicians, visual artists, and other
creatives and intellectuals.
