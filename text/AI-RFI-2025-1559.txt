General Comment
Am erica is an enteraim ent encom y, and Gen AI threatens that.
Gen AI is run off of thievery and incom petence. It produces subpar results and is So easily corruptible into incoherence. Do you think
world wide box office incom e will continue when all we turn out is trash?
If we let AI slop take over, then we stop being the entertainm ent giant we are as all we will turn out is unim pressive slop. If you want this
country to flourish and m aintain its tradition of being the standard by which all works are judged, you will protect the country from  Gen AI
crap and allow the creatives of this nation to m ake a living.
Hum an creatives are m ore profitable in the long run, m ore ethical in the short and long term  and the only way to m aintain our position in
the world econom y. 
Make the techbros work for their m oney instead of stealing everyone else's ideas and churning out the entertainm ent equivalent of pig
dung.
