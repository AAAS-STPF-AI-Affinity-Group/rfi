General Comment
So-called regulatory "burdens" are necessary to hold any business or industry accountable and protect the general public from
exploitation. Dropping basic safeguards for the em ergent AI industry, of all industries, would be incredibly reckless. US-based AI
com panies are already attracting billion-dollar investm ents, contracts, and partnerships anyway, so any failure of the US AI industry to
rem ain com petitive and profitable at this point would suggest there are deeper flaws in technology or business ventures that rely on it.
Further, if the US govt. is truly intent on protecting Am erican jobs, then unbridled investm ent in AI is the wrong way to go. If we use
generative AI to replace junior coders/program m ers, for instance, then new program m ers will no longer have a foot in the door in the tech
industry; eventually, in such a case, there will be no hum an program m ers left to replace senior program m ers once they retire. This is just
one exam ple; other career paths that are sim ilarly threatened include visual and audio effects work in film  and TV, tutoring, and editing
(articles, essays, etc.).
