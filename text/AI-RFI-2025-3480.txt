General Comment
I will be blunt: the internet on the whole will be eradicated if AI isn't properly regulated. If it requires data to build its m odel, any and all
sources of that data should be adequately com pensated or otherwise be off the table. So far, any and all generative form s of AI and
LLM's have been to the detrim ent of society and em boldened all num bers of scam m ers, grifters, crim inals and Large Com panies to
swindle com m on citizens out of their tim e, m oney and m ore. It has stolen hundreds of thousands of jobs from  hum ans all for the sake of
CEO's to save them selves m ore m oney and deprive all other people of quality services. In the past ten years, the United States has been
in nothing but a sharp decline due to these businesses skim ping and swindling people and doing sloppier and sloppier quality control.
LLM's will cause larger businesses to turn crim inal as well, find m ore and m ore excuses to take m ore and m ore jobs to the point of
com pletely elim inating the hum an elem ent that drew custom ers their way in the first place.
Alas, I'm  digressing. Generative AI/LLM should be m ade illegal, or otherwise subject to the sam e Copyright Laws as other m edia form s,
set as an Opt-In m odel where those who volunteer m ust be com pensated heavily up-front and for every hundred Generations after its
release, and otherwise subject to th heaviest m andates possible due to the severity of danger it has im pinged upon society.
