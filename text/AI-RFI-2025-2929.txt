General Comment
Although I believe that AI is a useful tool in m odern day, there needs to be m ore strict restrictions on how it’s im plem ented and what data
it derives from . In art we own our intellectual property and AI is a direct threat against an artist’s autonom y. With other program s like
writing and developm ent infrastructure, there is a direct im pact on jobs requiring these workers, and replacing them  with autom ated
system s that cannot inferior hum an needs. AI can be a tool if properly m aintained and regulated. Creating laws and processes that lim it its
ability to overpower the everyday person is vital. There are things in this world that we can autom ate with AI and can be upgraded to
replace positions that are unnecessary for hum an interference. Please place restrictions on this powerful tool. Peoples livelihoods are being
affected by the lack of restrictions in place. There are AI applications and deepfake technologies that im pact everyday citizens in negative
and dangerous ways. Thank you for reading.
