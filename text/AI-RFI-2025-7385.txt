General Comment
This is a terrible idea.
You could say that it is "progression", others m ight say it's not, but at the end of the day, the way that it reaches the result is through theft.
Artists generally want their art to have copyright because it's THEIR art.
Have AI use them  is downright disgusting. Im agine pouring a bunch of tim e into a piece, then som eone steals it and uses it for them selves.
"It's not stealing, it's inspiration!" No, it's not! Sure, I guess it's okay to give AI som e tenchiques that other artists use, but just taking their
art to process it? That is a violation of basic rights.
I understand that you want to progress in som e way, but let m e tell you, this "progression" will not be benefitial in the slightest.
All in all, allowing AI devs to bypass copyright laws is som ething that I, and I can also say with confidence, a LOT of people are not in
support of.
This is like plagarism , but changing it a little., like a school report. Unlike a school report, it doesn't affect anyone but the one who did it.
But this...this WILl affect other people, so it's for the best that we do NOT allow AI devs to bypass copyright laws.
And in m y personal opinion, allowing this is essentially disgusting and foul.
