General Comment
There is no practical use for generative AI. It doesn't bring us closer to actual, functional artificial intelligence. It has nothing to do with the
pattern recognition AI we're already successfully deploying in the sciences. Its only purpose and supposed value is the replacem ent of
hum an artists and writers. Which will just destroy m illions of jobs and create m ore slop nearly nobody's actually interested in seeing or
engaging with.
There is no practical reason to even allow generative AI to exist. None the less to give its developers com plete freedom  from  the
enforcem ent of copyright laws. Why on Earth would anybody who doesn't own one of these content piracy com panies want or support
this? And m aybe this will m ean m ore to you- if you give generative AI com panies perm ission to com pletely ignore copyright laws, why the
Hell should any Am erican pay them  any heed? Why should any Am erican ever follow any law that som e classes of citizens are arbitrarily
given the right to not abide by? You either have copyright protection laws, or you allow groups like OpenAI to have free and open access
to people's private and copyrighted works. You cannot have both.
