General Comment
I am  against the use of using technology to train generative AI or AI of any kinda on the copyrighted works of actual hum ans. The way I
see it, that is the future we are currently headed for. A world where we exist on to work an m ake profits for others, instead of enriching
our cultures and lives with artistic expression.
