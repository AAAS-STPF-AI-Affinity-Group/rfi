General Comment
Ai needs to be regulated for public safety and for job security. Many creative jobs and industries are at risk due to ai, this would ultim ately
cause even m ore unem ploym ent as jobs get taken over. Please, for the sake of all creatives, regulate AI. I am  a college aged student, with
friends going into a creative industry. They are scared for their futures with AI art becom ing m assively successful, we cannot afford to let
ai com panies to go unregulated. Please.
