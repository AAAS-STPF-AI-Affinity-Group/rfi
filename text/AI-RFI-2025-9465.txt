General Comment
AI is an extrem ely over hyped product that clearly is overinflated in value, m uch like the crypto, NFT, and m etaverse bubbles before it. It
does real harm  to countless industries but especially creative ones. Every tim e I see AI art I am  disgusted twice, one that I have to have
terrible art pushed on m e and second that there are real talented people who could have m ade said art but instead som eone decided to
m ake the m ost soulless thing im aginable. I donâ€™t think it belongs anywhere in our governm ent.
