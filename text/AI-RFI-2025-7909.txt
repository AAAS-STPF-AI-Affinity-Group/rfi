General Comment
If anything of the satirized m edia involving the overstepping of governm ent, history of greed, and predictions of the destruction of society
will tell you why this is a bad idea to let m en driven by greed and unchecked expansionism  have free and unregulated access to work not
belonging to them .
Change your m ind and heart, do som ething, before we continue taking steps to som ething terrible.
