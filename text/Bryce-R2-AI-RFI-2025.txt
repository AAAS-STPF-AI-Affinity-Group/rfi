AI, in it's current state, does not deserve the funding nor attention it is receiving. Especially
when it's raking in millions from theft & replacing the people AI is supposed to be helping.  
To be precise, OpenAI and Google train their models - ChatGPT & Gemini, respectively - onlarge collection of data. That data includes your IP address, location, phone calls and otherusage data, alongside any files you think of; all of which without consent.
With these bottomless wells of data, Gemini and ChatGPT can produce deceptive images, text,
audio and video. In other words, it can flood the Internet with false information, imitation ofother people & other "deepfakes", while the developer of the AI model sell our data to othercompanies.
Thus, the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan should not be
implemented until OpenAI finds a more ethical way to power their AI models.
