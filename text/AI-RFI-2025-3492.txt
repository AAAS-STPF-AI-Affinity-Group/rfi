General Comment
Revoking EO 14110 was a m istake. Private sector AI developers are NOT being "ham pered by unnecessary regulation". These
com panies are already running a scam , prom ising radical and unbelievable innovations when in reality their "product" is no m ore advanced
an algorithm  than what Youtube uses to suggest videos. Not to m ention the very existence of said "product" requires insane am ounts of
energy, water, and the wanton scraping of anything and everything on the net.
This "Action Plan" is horribly ill-advised at best, and at worst it is a blatantly nepotistic attem pt to enrich these com panies. Do NOT
im plem ent it.
