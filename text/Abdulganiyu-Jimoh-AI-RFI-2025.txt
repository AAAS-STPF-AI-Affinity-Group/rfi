Office  of Science  and Technology  Policy (OSTP),  
Attn:  Faisal  D'Souza, NITRD  National Coordination  Office  (NCO)  
Response  to Request  for Information  (RFI)  on the Development  of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan in United States of America  
Dear  OSTP  and NITRD  NCO  Team,  
I value the chance and the opportunity to contribute to the development of the AI Action 
Plan , which  was directed by  Executive  Order  14179,  which  President  Donald  Trump  signed 
on January 23, 2025.  For the future of the country, it is imperative that the United States 
maintain its leading position in AI while promoting economic competitiveness, innovation, 
and security.  I have  included  a list of important  targets  and suggestions  for the development 
of the U.S. AI Action Plan below.  
1.Strengthening  AI Infrastructure  and Compute  Resources
•Invest  in Domestic  AI Hardware  and Chips:  Building  on the CHIPS  and Science
Act (2022), the United States should increase manufacturing investments in
semiconductors to lessen dependency on overseas supply chains.
•Energy -Efficient  AI Systems:  To guarantee  sustainable  AI infrastructure,  incentives
for energy -efficient AI models and data centers should be offered.
Policy  Actions:  
•Increase  domestic  semiconductor  production  to lessen  reliance  on imported  hardware
and protect the AI supply chain.
•To guarantee  sustainable  AI growth,  U.S should  offer  tax incentives  or breaks  and
federal funds for AI data centers that use less energy.
•R&D  expenditures  for next-generation  AI chips  that are tuned  for high-performance
computation and energy efficiency should be increased.
Reference:  CHIPS  and Science  Act (2022),  Executive  Order  14179  (2025)
2.Open -Source  AI and Model  Transparency
•Government Support for Open AI Models: By providing funding for the
development  of open -source  AI, big businesses  or companies  will be prevented  from
monopolizing the market in the United States.


2 •Assurance  and Explainability:  AI systems  ought  to be comprehensible,  especially  in
high-risk industries like healthcare, finance, and law.
Policy  Actions:  
•To encourage  competition  and openness,  federal  incentives  for the development  of
open -source AI models should be established.
•Mandate  explainability  and fairness  assessments  for AI systems utilized  in vital fields,
such as law, healthcare, and finance.
•Standardized  AI governance  frameworks  should  be developed  to guarantee
responsible implementation in both the public and private sectors.
Reference:  The White  House  AI Bill of  Rights  (2022),  OECD  AI Principles  (2023)
3.AI Safety,  Cybersecurity and National  Security
•Strengthen  AI Security  Against  Adversarial  Attacks:  AI models  ought  to be
developed with defense against adversarial attacks and data poisoning.
•Defense  and National  Security  Applications:  To guarantee  that AI technologies  can
fend off new cyberthreats, national security objectives should guide AI research.
Policy  Actions:  
•To defend  against  hostile  attacks,  model  ingestion,  and unauthorized  data exfiltration,
implement AI -specific cybersecurity guidelines into place.
•Develop  national  security  applications  powered  by AI while  making  sure they adhere
to moral AI standards.
A national  AI security  task force  should  be established  to keep  an eye on and address
threats from hostile countries.

4.Protecting AI Intellectual Property and Addressing AI Distillation Concerns
According  to recent  allegations,  High -Flyer's  DeepSeek,  a Chinese  AI company,  may
have  violated  OpenAI's  terms  of service  by reportedly  using  distillation  techniques  to
unlawfully extract knowledge from OpenAI's models. In late 2024, OpenAI and
Microsoft are looking into data exfiltration instances where OpenAI developer
accounts, allegedly connected to DeepSeek, were used to turn OpenAI's output into
rival models, according to Bloomberg and the Financial Times.
•Strengthen AI IP Protections: American AI companies need to be protected
from intellectual property theft and illegal distillation. Stricter cybersecurity
regulations  should  be in place  to safeguard  AI models  from  being  exploited  by
overseas rivals.
•Enforce  AI Trade  and Security  Measures:  Strict  penalties  should  be applied
for infractions, and policies should be put in place to stop AI abuse through
distillation and unapproved model training.


3 •Promote  International  Cooperation:  To guarantee  that AI trade  regulations
are implemented globally and to set standards for moral AI  development, the
United States should collaborate with allies.
Policy  Actions:  
•Strengthen  legal  protections  against  AI distillation  to prevent  intellectual
property theft and unauthorized knowledge extraction.
•Implement  stricter  AI export  controls  to prevent  unauthorized  use of U.S.
AI technologies by foreign adversaries.
•Enhance  cybersecurity  protocols  for AI APIs  and developer  platforms  to
detect and prevent large -scale data exfiltration.

make DeepSeek"  
5.Data  Privacy  and AI Ethics
•Establish  Robust  Data  Governance  Frameworks:  Ensure  that privacy  rules  are
followed while training AI on data that has been ethically sourced.
•Balanced  Regulations:  AI policy  should  be balanced,  protecting  civil freedom
without placing undue restrictions that hinder progress in the private sector.
Policy  Actions:  
•To safeguard  user data while  permitting  responsible  AI innovation,  robust  AI privacy
legislation should be introduced.
•Demand  that companies  creating  AI follow  moral  data sourcing  guidelines  to
guarantee adherence to privacy regulations.
•Uses  of AI-powered  privacy -preserving  strategies  like differential  privacy  and
federated learning.

(2023)
6.AI Research  and Workforce Development
•Expand  AI Education  and Workforce  Training:  Universities  and technical  colleges
must receive more money for their AI education and research initiatives.
•Attract  Global  AI Talent:  To be competitive,  the US should  make  it easier  for
entrepreneurs and AI experts to obtain visas.
Policy  Actions:  
•To give workers  and students  the skills  they need  for AI-driven  industries,  expand  AI
education efforts.


4 •To spur innovation  and preserve  American  leadership  in AI, public  funds  should  be
made available for AI research at academic institutions.
•Simplify  visa requirements  for foreign  AI researchers  and business  owners  in order  to
attract top talent to the United States.

7.International  AI Leadership  and Competition
•Establish  Global  AI Standards:  Along  with allies,  the United  States  should  take the
lead in establishing moral AI governance structures.
•Balanced AI Export Controls: To safeguard American interests without impeding
cooperation,  export  restrictions  pertaining  to AI should  be strategically  implemented.
Policy  Actions:  
•To create  international  standards  for AI governance,  strengthen  AI partnerships  with
democratic nations.
•Develop  international  trade  agreements  to keep  authoritarian  governments  from
abusing AI and to guarantee ethical AI development.
•Establish  fair AI export  regulations  that safeguard  American  technology  superiority
without impeding constructive international cooperation.

Conclusion  
The AI Action Plan offers a chance to position the United States at the leading edge of AI 
development while maintaining economic expansion and national security. Achieving this 
goal will require  giving  top priority  to open -source  development,  cybersecurity,  privacy, 
workforce training, AI infrastructure, and global leadership . 
I appreciate  the opportunity  to contribute  to this discussion  and look forward  to seeing  the AI 
Action Plan finalized. Thank you for your time and consideration.
