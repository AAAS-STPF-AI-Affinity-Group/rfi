General Comment
Under no circum stances should any AI business, product, or service be exem pted from  copyright law for any reason, nor should any AI
com pany or user be im m une from  lawsuits concerning sam e. These com panies build their libraries based on theft of copyrighted artistic
m aterial, words, and im ages. It is no different than piracy. No com pany or governm ent should use stolen m aterial for AI production.
Hum ans produce works stolen by these AI com panies and receive no com pensation. This is theft of labor and econom ically dam aging to
writers and artists. Generative AI steals m y livelihood as a writer, holds no benefit for the future of Am erica, does not produce correct
inform ation, and is nothing m ore than a snake oil scam  on the Am erican people.
