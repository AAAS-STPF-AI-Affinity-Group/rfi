I am not as versed on this subject matter as many others are. However, I am concerned. My 
understanding is that one of the creators of AI walked away from it entirely. The Center for AI 
Safety has many signatures of people "in the know" regarding AI. Ameri ca Ialready has nuclear 
bombs. Other countries also have nuclear weapons. AI Safety site online has many signatures of 
notable public figures who warn us that we should mitigate the risk of extinction through AI as 
well as other global problems that could destroy and in fact has destroyed life in the past such as 
pandemics and nuclear. In addition to the dangers that AI could cause, AI also puts many 
creative people out of work. What jobs would be provided for artists, writers and such? I truly 
wonder if th is is a good idea. We can kill each other through epidemiology attacks; nuclear 
attacks and others. Do we really want to move forward with AI when so many noted individuals 
are concerned about this? Thank you, Iris M. Cripe -Eng
