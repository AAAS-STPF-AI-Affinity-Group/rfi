Introduction  
This response is submitted by Brian Charles, PhD, in response to the Federal Register 
notice [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/06/2025 -02305/request -for-
information -on-the-development -of-an-artificial-intelligence -ai-action-plan].   
I am an expert in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Organizational Leadership, with 30+ 
years of experience in strategic management and executive education  to advance 
corporations’ technology transformation goals .  My insights are informed by years of 
research, teaching, and practical application of AI in various business contexts across the 
private and public sectors.  
This response proposes to build a national repository of online microcourses that will 
benefit American industry and government by efficiently educating leaders in artificial 
intelligence (AI) so as to achieve strategic advantage on a global scale.  
 
Background  
For the past eight years, I have facilitated the Artificial Intelligence: Implications for 
Business Strategy program offered by MIT through 2U/edX 
[https://executive.mit.edu/course/artificial -intelligence/a056g00000URaa3AAD.html ], 
educating thousands of executives on the responsible use of AI and its strategic 
application in businesses around the globe.  Additionally, my forthcoming paper, "The Real 
Value of AI -Aided Executive Education" (Charles, B., Forthcoming, Academy of 
Management Learning and Education) explores the transformative potential of AI in 
enhancing learning experiences for executives (Charles, 2025).  
My book, Embracing the Future of Organizational Leadership: The Power of Artificial 
Intelligence  (Charles, 2024), further discusses how AI can be strategically integrated into 
organizational structures to foster innovation and efficiency.  The body of my work 


 2 underscores the importance of fostering AI systems that are free from ideological bias or 
engineered social agendas, as echoed in recent federal directives (Executive Order, 2025).   
 
Key Considerations for the AI Action Plan  
In developing the Federal AI Action Plan, I urge consideration of the following microcourse 
components , with a particular emphasis on executive education aimed specifically at 
American business leaders and provided free of charge in order to promote American 
business competitiveness .  These courses will be delivered in short -form format (i.e., 
“microcourses,” delivered via platforms such as X) .  For reference, a microcourse is defined 
as a short, focused interactive online course that can be completed at a user’s pace via a 
device or medium of their choice.  
The following topics have been identified by this researcher as consistent with the 
Administration’s goals for the ‘AI Action Plan’ and the needs of business leaders studied by 
the researcher – and will be critical components to advancing US AI initiatives:  
 
1. Promoting AI Literacy and Skills Development : A key component of the AI Action 
Plan should be to enhance AI literacy across all sectors, particularly within leadership 
roles. Executive education programs play a vital role in equipping leaders with the 
knowledge and skills necessary to understand and  implement AI technologies effectively. 
This aligns with the imperative to promote American leadership in AI, as highlighted in the 
Executive Order (2025).  
2. Fostering Ethical AI Implementation : Ethical considerations surrounding AI are 
paramount. The Action Plan should emphasize the importance of responsible AI 
development and deployment, including addressing issues such as data privacy, 
algorithmic bias, and transparency. Executive education c an integrate ethical frameworks 
and case studies to guide leaders in making informed decisions about AI implementation 
(Charles, 2024). My research (Charles, 2025) emphasizes the need for careful 
consideration of the b oundaries of AI use in executive education, ensuring a balance 
between technological innovation and human interaction.  
3. Encouraging Innovation through AI in Education : The Action Plan should 
incentivize the integration of AI into educational methodologies. AI can personalize learning 
experiences, streamline communication, and foster critical thinking (Charles, 2025). 
Investment in AI -driven educational tools and platfo rms can significantly improve learning 
outcomes for executives and professionals.  


 3 4. Addressing the Skills Gap : As AI technologies continue to evolve, there is a growing 
need to address the skills gap in the workforce. The Action Plan should promote initiatives 
that encourage lifelong learning and skills development, enabling individuals to adapt to 
the changing d emands of the AI -driven economy. Executive education programs can play a 
crucial role in upskilling and reskilling professionals to meet these demands. As noted in 
my paper, The Real Value of AI -Aided Executive Education, integr ating AI into learning 
environments can significantly improve the application of learned skills in the workplace. 
(Charles, 2025)  
5. Public-Private Partnerships : Encourage collaboration between government, 
academia, and industry to develop and deploy effective AI education and training programs 
– such as this proposal to build microcourses on X and/or other contemporary online 
platforms. These partnerships can le verage the expertise and resources of all stakeholders 
to address the challenges and opportunities presented by AI.  
6. Maintaining American Leadership in AI : Aligning with the Executive Order (2025), 
the AI Action Plan should prioritize the development of AI systems that promote free 
markets, world -class research, and entrepreneurial spirit, while also addressing potential 
risks and biases. Executive educatio n can play a critical role in fostering a culture of 
responsible AI innovation that upholds these values.  
7. Promulgating National Online Executive Education Courses : As a concrete AI 
policy action, the US Government should consider developing and deploying national 
online executive education courses for all US business leaders – again, as -per this 
proposal.  The objective is to improve their competitiveness by understanding how to 
implement AI responsibly and effectively in their workplaces. Recent data indicates that 
organizations that successfully integrate AI  see a substantial increase in productivity and 
enhanced strategic decision -making [See: McKinsey Global Institute, "Notes from the AI 
frontier: Modeling the impact of AI on the world economy," September 2018]. This initiative 
would directly contribute to national growth and productivity.  
 
 
 
A Proposed Micro course Structure  
I am confident that my extensive experience in teaching AI to executives, including my role 
on behalf of MIT for 2U/edX, positions me well to contribute to the development of such a 


 4 national program.  Building upon the successful MIT course’s general scope, a potential 
executive education program could be structured as follows:  
• Module 1: AI Fundamentals : Introduction to AI concepts, machine learning, deep 
learning, and natural language processing.  
• Module 2: AI Strategy & Implementation : Developing an AI strategy, identifying use 
cases, and implementing AI solutions in various business functions.  
• Module 3: Ethical AI & Governance : Addressing ethical considerations, data 
privacy, algorithmic bias, and responsible AI governance.  
• Module 4: AI for Competitive Advantage : Using AI to drive innovation, improve 
operational efficiency, and gain a competitive edge in the marketplace.  
• Module 5: AI Leadership & Change Management : Leading AI initiatives, managing 
change, and fostering a culture of AI innovation within organizations.  
 
The Role of AI in Enhancing Executive Education  
AI can significantly enhance executive education by:  
• Personalized Learning : Tailoring educational content to individual learner needs 
and preferences  through AI -powered adaptive learning platforms.  
• Improved Engagement : Utilizing AI -driven tools to create interactive and engaging 
learning experiences, such as simulations, virtual reality environments, and gamified 
modules. My research indicates that interactive learning significantly boosts retention rates 
among partici pants (Charles, 2025).  
• Data-Driven Insights : Leveraging AI analytics to track learner progress, identify 
areas for improvement, and provide personalized feedback.  
• Enhanced Accessibility : Making education more accessible to a wider audience 
through AI -powered translation tools, captioning services, and adaptive interfaces.  
 
 
Conclusion  
The development of a comprehensive Federal AI Action Plan presents a unique opportunity 
to harness the transformative potential of AI for the benefit of society.  By prioritizing AI 


 5 literacy, ethical implementation, innovation, and skills development, we can ensure that 
the United States remains a leader in the AI era.  Executive education, in particular, will be 
crucial in equipping leaders with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the 
complexities of AI and drive innovation within their organizations.  Delivering such 
education in a format that is easy -to-consume and pervasive is both the challenge and the 
opportunity confronting the US in order for it to remain globally co mpetitive in the age of AI.  
It is imperative that we foster an environment where AI systems are developed and 
deployed responsibly, adhering to ethical principles and promoting American values  
(Executive Order, 2025) .  The implementation of national online executive education 
courses, as proposed, would represent a significant step toward realizing these goals.  
Thank you for considering my input.  I am available to provide further insights and expertise 
as needed.
