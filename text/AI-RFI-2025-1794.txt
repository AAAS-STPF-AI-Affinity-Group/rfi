General Comment
The copyright clause in the Constitution states that:
"To prom ote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for lim ited Tim es to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
respective Writings and Discoveries."
When Large Learning Model (LLM) AI scrape the web to feed their program s, what they are doing is unconstitutional. Our fram ers
recognized that without ownership of writings and discoveries, the hum ans who are the engines of science and creators of art will no
longer have an incentive to create, thus stifling our progress as a species.
We cannot let people steal knowledge to feed LLMs. It will be the death of hum an progress. An industry that cannot thrive without theft is
one not worth supporting.
