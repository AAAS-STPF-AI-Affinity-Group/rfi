General Comment
AI art is built on the theft of the tim e, experience, and effort of hum ans. Yes, I wish I could tap a few keys and see on screen the im ages in
m y im agination. But I have no legal or m oral right to the work of som eone else and they have no legal or m oral right to m ine.
Also, without hum an eyes reviewing output, m istakes creep in. That's not too worrisom e with im ages, but what about AI-written
textbooks? Or AI-written software applications? There is a significant difference between "Let's eat, Grandm a" and "Let's eat Grandm a"
but both are gram m atically correct sentences. It does not have to be a m ajor error to be a significant error.
Furtherm ore, I want robots to do m y dishes and clean m y house so I can write books, not write books and leave m e to clean m y house!
