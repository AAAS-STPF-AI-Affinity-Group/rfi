General Comment
Ai is a thieving scam  that takes from  the art and writing of our culture and the livelihoods of artists and in return provides a subpar
m ediocre work that destroys the environm ent. Gen AI is not being used properly and is solely intended to steal work and jobs from  the
already threatened artistic industries. Protect real art!
