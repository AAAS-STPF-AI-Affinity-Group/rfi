General Comment
I am  Veronica Garcia, a senior at Avonworth High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I studied generative AI and its im pact in the
classroom , specifically in English as a Second Language education for two m onths in a course on AI and Ethics this year. I believe this
adm inistration’s viewpoint on A.I. is too liberal in its deregulation. I believe an em erging industry m ust be carefully m onitored while not
stifling innovation. This delicate balance is possible, though, the adm inistration’s attitude towards the AI industry indicates this balance
cannot be reached. The com plete deregulation of the em erging industry in hopes of inspiring innovation is com pletely reckless. Regulation
is necessary for nurturing an industry in its infancy. Com plete deregulation risks fostering m alevolence, m isuse of this new technology, and
em erging m onopolies. Additionally, student’s ability to freely access AI is alarm ing. Generative AI, specifically, is m ost prom inent in
schools. Generative AI is not inspiring innovative thinkers and productivity in our students but rather teaching students to over-rely on this
powerful technology. This in turn is hindering student’s intellectual capabilities and developm ent. Student’s freely accessing generative AI
is detrim ental to the future of our country. This adm inistration has to work to address these concerns for their future im plications.
