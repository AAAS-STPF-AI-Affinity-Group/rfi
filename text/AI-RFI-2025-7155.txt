General Comment
Generative AI/LLMs have no place in a healthy future of the US workforce and are erroneously conflated with m ore legitim ate form s of
m achine learning. Generative AI/LLMs are trained on outright theft of unlicensed copyrighted and non-consensually acquired creative
m aterials and their output is, functionally, algorithm ically-produced falsehoods not useful for worthwhile research and legally risky/ethically
dubious to use in broad com m ercial creative works.
Restrictions on the works these m odels can be trained with should never be lifted and further, the existing m odels should be scrubbed due
to the literal theft em ployed in their creation.
