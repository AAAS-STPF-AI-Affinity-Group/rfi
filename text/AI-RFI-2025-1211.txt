General Comment
I think we should prioritize:
Not letting AI m odels and the servers they run on take up too m uch energy
Consum er protection so Am ericans aren't forced to deal with this stuff if they don't want to (ex: easy option to decline use on m y laptop)
Respect to copyright so artists don't get ripped off
Respect to privacy so the AI isn't trained on personal data
Labor protections so com panies don't try to replace Am erican workers with AI 'agents' that cannot perform  as well as people
