General Comment
As an actor for film  and TV, m y perform ance has enduring, m onetary value. (Reflected in the industry in the form  of residual paym ents.)
But if that perform ance can be ingested, analyzed, and recreated by AI without m y consent and without any com pensation, m y livelihood
is directly threatened. If I'm  cast in a role to play a chef, I can't go to the grocery store, clean the m eat aisle out of prim e rib, and say "Well
I'm  sorry but I'm  a poor actor and I can't properly portray a chef if I don't train m yself by cooking all these steaks." Sim ilarly, if AI
com panies can't train their m odels without com pensating and getting consent from  the copyright holders, that's solely a failing of their
business m odel. It's not the governm ent's job to endorse or excuse theft - whether that theft is a grocery cart full of steaks or a
copyrighted perform ance, script, picture, or other work of art.
