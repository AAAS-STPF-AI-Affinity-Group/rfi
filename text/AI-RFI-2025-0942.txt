General Comment
I encourage a focus on reducing energy consum ption while increasing efficiency as a highest priority policy action that should be in the new
AI Action Plan. 
Data centers should m itigate the carbon em issions associated with AI's energy consum ption by transitioning to renewable energy sources
such as solar or wind and adopting energy-efficient practices. AI m ust have net zero em issions to keep pace with international clim ate
goals.
