General Comment
"Burdensom e governm ent regulations" you m ean they were barred from  STEALING copyrighted m aterial.
AI isn't going to be the m agic bullet you think it is. Everything it does that even LOOKS im pressive, it's done because it was allowed to
steal people's work without paying for it.
Look. I actually really like AI. I think it's very cool. I have an OpenAI subscription because it helps m e with writing tasks.
But if they're going to use a writer's work or an artist's work, they need to pay a fair price for it and they need to get sued if they steal.
