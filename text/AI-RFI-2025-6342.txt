General Comment
Hello. 
I do not wish to see AI nor AI related com panies like OpenAI to have power over the public, these com panies flourish by stealing the
work of us hardworking individuals online and is used to threaten the livelihood of m any creative people in our country.
AI is m ade through theft and I do not support it in any way, please reconsider.
Thank you
