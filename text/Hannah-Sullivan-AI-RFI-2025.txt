It is important that any US AI action plan take proactive measures against harmful uses of AI. These 
possible harms include using AI to generate child pornography or to generate false audio, images, 
and/or video which could negatively impact a person's rep utation, or to generate and disseminate 
misinformation. Historically, the federal government has been slow and weak in their retroactive 
responses to problems posed by technological advances. We should take great care to avoid this 
being repeated with AI. Additionally, it is important that we minimize environmental effects of AI. AI 
is known to create higher levels of carbon emissions than previous uses of technology. I ask that 
the AI Action Plan create regulations to limit and/or offset carbon emissions r esulting from the use 
of AI.
