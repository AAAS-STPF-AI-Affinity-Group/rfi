General Comment
AI is a dead-end false prophet "technology" based alm ost entirely on speculation and m arketing. It would be to the entire detrim ent of the
United States of Am erica to pursue an AI "Plan" at all, and any private sector AI developm ent should not be encouraged by any
governm ent action.
