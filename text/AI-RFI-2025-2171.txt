General Comment
Generative Artificial Intelligence is a scam  and a fraud based on stolen copyrighted content. These new regulations would stifle creativity
and art in the US to serve the interest of tech billionaires to put countless professional writers, artists, and m usicians out of work. The
im pact on the econom y would be negative, serving only to benefit a few hucksters and con m en.
