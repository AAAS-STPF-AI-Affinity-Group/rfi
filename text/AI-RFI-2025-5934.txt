General Comment
As a self-published author, I can think of now reason why authors and other content creators should not own and control their own
creations. Any benefit from  m y work should accrue to m e or m y chosen partners, not to AI. Indeed, it not the case that AI has been
shown to be benefit the com m on weal, and I have no reason to expect that this will benefit anyone besides the owners of the AI platform s.
Like the Com m unist regim es that expropriated property for the state, this is a lawless expropriation that will aggrandize powerful interests
at the expense of the public.
