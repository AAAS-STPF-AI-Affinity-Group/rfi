General Comment
The use of any AI, generative or not, MUST be strictly regulated. The idea that the USA has to attain superiority over China in the race
for AI is grotesquely sim ilar to the race for dom ination of the m ine shafts that Dr. Strangelove's character exclaim ed at the end of that
satirical film  from  1964! To beat the Russians to the control over the m ine shafts in the earth to protect against the nuclear fallout that was
about to happen when the US accidentally attacked he USSR with a nuclear bom b. 
There is an hysterical knee-jerk reaction by the entire current adm inistration to have worldwide dom ination including the absurd ideas of
buying Greenland, annexing Canada as the 521st state and controlling the Panam a Canal, and that I fear is just the beginning. 
We m ust first protect our civil liberties from  being stripped away under the guise of fear of China overtaking us in the race for better AI.
And while they are proposing that the adm inistration has cozied up to the tech giants who donated m illions to get the president elected.
They are the ones who want to loosen the protections for their own financial gain only, not to be in the best interests of the people of the
US. The federal governm ent m ust not leave self-regulation as the guide rails to the im plem entation of AI which will decim ate all of our first
am endm ent rights, privacy and m ore.
It m ust be regulated by a departm ent of the governm ent free from  anyone or anything with a financial interest at stake.
