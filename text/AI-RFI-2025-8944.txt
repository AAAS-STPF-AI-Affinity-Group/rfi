General Comment
Any delusions of AI serving for the greater good of creative output are going to go up in flam es as it will cause m ultiple industries to fall
into ruin, and potentially even cause great political turm oil. This *will* initiate a spiral. Do not be deluded into believing that allowing AI to
pull and train from  copyrighted works will allow for anything good. Do not put this plan into action. Apply restrictions before it's too late.
