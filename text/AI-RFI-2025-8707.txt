General Comment
Artificial Intelligence as it exists today is built around stealing from  the creations of Am erican citizens in support of a speculative m arket
that has already been subject to significant concerns regarding security, transparency, and property rights. Allowing even less
accountability in the use of this technology would be hugely detrim ental to the rights and livelihoods of the people of this country.
