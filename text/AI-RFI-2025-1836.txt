General Comment
The AI initiative is an absolute farce. It is a waste of resources to m aintain and is theft am ong artists, writers and creators. No consum er
will support it and actively avoid its functionality and the fact that allowing corporations to utilize and leech content they do not own is
blatant plagiarism , and is especially dangerous since it is stealing from  businesses and individuals who rely on their own work to survive. If
AI becom es unregulated and free to poach whatever it pleases, the consequences would be unfathom able.
