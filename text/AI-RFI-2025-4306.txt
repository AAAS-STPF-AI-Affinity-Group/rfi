General Comment
OpenAI is an over-hyped product and the head of an econom ic bubble thatâ€™s about to burst. Microsoft no longer wants to bankroll it
because Microsoft knows that there is no future in this dying com pany. Do not allow OpenAI to leech off the Am erican taxpayers. If Bill
Gates knows that OpenAI is garbage, the Am erican governm ent and the Am erican people should too.
