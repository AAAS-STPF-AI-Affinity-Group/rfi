 Executive Summary  
 
Arizona State University (ASU) is pleased to submit the following materials in response 
to the request for information from the Networking Information and Technology 
Research and Development (NITRD) Program's National Coordination Office (NCO) on 
behalf of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).  
 
ASU's comments to inform the  development of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
("Plan") draw on our expertise as a leading public research university committed to U.S. 
dominance in AI and related technologies . ASU is a comprehensive public research 
institution prioritizing national service at scale, with total enrollment reaching 181,000 students in Fall 2024 across physical campuses and extensive online programs.   
Complementing ASU's significant educational reach is a robust research enterprise, with research expenditures totaling nearly $1 billion. ASU has also consistently been recognized as a leader in innovation and ranked the most innovative school in the 
United States by U.S. News & World Report for ten consecutive years.   
 
Below are answers to the questions posed in the request for public comment and additional  
background on ASU's programs and capabilities aligned with the Plan. 
 
Responses  
 Education and Workforce 
 
Developing engineering and AI-ready talent at scale is critical to continued U.S. 
leadership. ASU is educating the AI workforce of the future with the necessary skills to lead in both engineering for AI and AI for engineering. Scaling requires a multi-pronged 
approach to workforce development, including degree programs, non-degree programs, K-12 engagement, and faculty development . ASU also offers upskilling and reskilling 
programs to help fill national workforce gaps in AI-related skills among current 
employees. 
  
For degree-seeking students, ASU's Fulton Schools of Engineering represent the largest 
and one of the most comprehensive engineering programs in the nation, with more than 
33,000 students enrolled in Fall 2024. To achieve this scale, ASU developed and 
deployed new education technologies that have enabled the University to quadruple the 
number of STEM graduates over the last two decades and triple the number of engineering students over the last decade — from 9,300 to more than 30,000 students. 
And ASU will continue scaling its program to support U.S. AI leadership.  
  
For example, ASU established a new School of Manufacturing Systems and Networks in 
2021, building upon the University's existing manufacturing and systems engineering 
programs while strategically centering its curriculum, research portfolio, and industry 
engagements to meet the growing demands of an evolving manufacturing landscape in 
semiconductors and related technologies. A primary purpose of this new school is to  
 
 


2  
  
help fill the more than 2 million manufacturing jobs projected to be created by 2030 , all of 
which AI will enable.  
Additionally, public research universities and community colleges must work together to 
expand the AI-ready workforce, including everything from hardware manufacturing to infrastructure construction and maintenance to integrating AI into every sector of the 
economy.  
 
Policy Recommendations: We recommend the Plan prioritize helping every American 
become AI-ready through access to educational and workforce development programs, including non-degree upskilling and r eskilling programs. A national initiative of this scale 
requires government universities, community colleges, and industry all working together. 
To th at end, the Plan should: 
• Support the creation , expansion, and standardization of AI degree programs, 
certifications, and technical training.  
• Provide incentives for companies to create internship and apprenticeship 
programs that give students and workers hands-on experience. 
• Incentivize companies to invest in AI workforce training through university and 
community college partnerships. 
• Establish regional AI training centers where higher education institutions, industry, 
and federal, state, and local governments collaborate to develop the local workforce. 
• Establish an AI Workforce Task Force to convene industry, higher education 
institutions, and federal agencies to align workforce development efforts with 
economic and national security priorities. 
 Application and Use  
 
ASU is applying AI to advance research, improve learning, and prepare students to be 
lifelong learners. In January 2024, ASU became the first university to partner with OpenAI to leverage and scale its AI capabilities for education. ASU's partnership with 
OpenAI has focused on enhancing student success, forging new avenues for innovative 
research, and expanding access to cutting-edge AI tools for students and researchers . 
This partnership helps faculty generate innovative research proposals on AI applications across various fields, including education, energy, supply chains, and healthcare. The 
Plan should continue encouraging academic-industry partnerships to use AI to solve the most pressing societal challenges across education, national security, energy, and 
health. 
 
Policy Recommendation: We recommend the Plan prioritize the application of AI to solve 
the nation's  most pressing challenges . Such solutions could include developing 
advanced AI-enabled education technologies. 
 
Explainability and Assurance of AI Model Outputs  
 
ASU researchers are advancing verification technology to detect AI-generated content, 
including identifying voice cloning used in widespread scams. For example, ASU's 
OriginStory project uses new microphone technology to verify that a human speaker 


3 produced the recorded speech, then watermarks the speech as authentically human. 
The watermark can be shown to listeners, establishing trust from recording to retrieval. 
This verification work will protect Americans from scams and could be used to verify the 
authenticity of evidence for criminal prosecutions. 
Policy Recommendation: We recommend the Plan prioritize programs for AI verification 
technology generated by industry and academia to protect Americans from scams and 
other criminal activity. 
National Security, Defense, and Cybersecurity AI-driven cyberattacks pose a serious challenge to America's cybersecurity. As AI 
technologies become more accessible, even hackers with minimal technical skills will be 
more likely to execute widespread, sophisticated attacks on critical infrastructure successfully. At the same time, defenders can use AI to improve cybersecurity. AI-
powered cybersecurity tools leverag ing enhanced pattern-detection capabilities are 
especially promising for identifying cybersecurity threats, as are emerging approaches to applying formal methods to cybersecurity.  
However, cybersecurity is not the only national security domain in which AI will have a 
significant impact. New approaches to human, AI, and robot teaming offer capabilities 
that neither humans nor robots can achieve independently . For example, ASU's Center 
for Human, Artificial Intelligence, and Robot Teaming (CHART) combines research across computer science, robotics, law, art, and social science to create novel human-
machine systems through teaming. CHART's interdisciplinary offers a model for further 
enhancing the capabilities of humans and machines by working together.  
Policy Recommendation: We recommend the Plan prioritize R&D for cybersecurity use-
cases. We also recommend emphasizing human-machine teaming, especially applying 
human-machine teaming capabilities to national security. 
AI Hardware  
Universities play a central role in developing next-generation semiconductors essential to 
fielding increasingly advanced AI systems. In partnership with industry, universities can 
accelerate the transition from research to prototyping to mass production of AI hardware. 
Policy Recommendation: We recommend the Plan continue to support domestic AI 
hardware R&D, prototyping, and scaling by academia and industry.  Data Centers The rapid adoption of AI tools across sectors has vastly increased demand for data 
centers. To meet this need, ASU works with utilities and industry partners to design next-
generation data centers with enhanced computing power while improving operational 
efficiency by reducing energy and water usage.  
Energy consumption and energy costs are especially significant issues for AI data 
centers. University research can help address specific challenges in future data center 


4  
 design, development, and operation, including energy resilience, AI-driven optimization, 
and advanced materials and construction techniques. 
 
AI tools can also help to manage shifting data center power demand by dynamically 
balancing and redistributing computational workloads across regions, increasing 
resiliency, and mitigating risks associated with  natural disasters and national security-
related disruptions.   
Finally, atmospheric water harvesting is a method of water collection that draws water 
from humidity in the air. Such techniques can reduce data centers' demand for water, 
aiming to make next-generation data centers net-zero water consumers. 
  
Developing Non-Water -Cooling Techniques. R&D into novel coolants other than water 
and new approaches to the built environment, like integrated air-cooling infrastructure, also present pathways for reducing data center water demand. 
 
Policy Recommendation: We recommend that the AI Action Plan support university and 
industry R&D on AI-powered workload distribution, predictive maintenance, and automated resource management to enhance data centers' capabilities and operational 
efficiency. We recommend the Plan prioritize funding for universities to research and 
deploy new energy and water efficiency systems for AI data centers. 
 
Open-Source Development and the National AI Research Resource 
 Open -source AI tools advance research, foster innovation, and ensure equitable access 
to cutting-edge technology within universities and educational settings. Open -source AI 
is essential for university research and training the next generation of AI practitioners .  
 Similarly, ASU supports the objectives of the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR), 
which include making more advanced computing clusters available to academic 
researchers. 
 
Policy Recommendation: We recommend that the Plan encourage the development of 
open-source models – especially for academia -- while ensuring safeguards to protect intellectual property and national security interests. We also recommend continuing to 
scale the NAIRR.
