1.A Strategic Vision for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Leadership
The United States (U .S.) has long been a global leader in developing and perfecting advanced 
technologies that drive dominance in information technology, energy, manufacturing, and communications sectors. This investment has also ensured our superiority in signals intelligence (SIGINT ), communications  networks and technologies, and military capabilities. Today, strategic 
investments in AI, machine learning, and autonomous systems present opportunities to enhance all aspects of US national power —diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME).  
For the U .S. to maintain leadership in emerging technologies and reap economic and security 
benefits, a collaborative strategy involving both government and private sectors is essential. Just as government -private sector partnerships propelled advancements in the internet, global 
positioning systems , semiconductors, and quantum technologies, AI dominance can similarly 
shape the global landscape and bolster national security and U.S. economic competitiveness.  
An AI Action Plan is a strategic imperative for the nation ’s future. It is not just a roadmap for 
technological advancement but a call to action for proactive leadership. The Administration must drive private sector growth, invest in research and development to bring new technologies to 
market, and promote public sector adoption. Achieving this requires public -private partnerships, 
strategic public sector investment, and AI governance standards to shape the market and ensure data security. Investing in these a reas will enable the US to maintain its leadership in AI, drive 
economic growth, enhance national security, and promote responsible AI development. 
The CNA Corporation (CNA) is eager to leverage our  decades of  public sector experience 
and capabilities  to help the government achieve its goals of maintaining U .S. supremacy in AI 
capabilities and technology. By aiding in AI policy development, strategic planning, and 
implementation, CNA equips government agencies with the essential policies, procedures, and 
tools to seamlessly integrate AI technologies, helping enhance mission efficiency and public 
service effectiveness.   


As a nonprofit company, CNA’s emerging technology experts are free from the conflicts of 
interest inherent in companies that develop and field their own technologies . This independence 
allows us to objectively assess processes, systems, and programs for our government clients and 
sponsors.  CNA  leverages data analytics and sophisticated methods to support federal, state, and 
local government officials as they work to protect the homeland, the American people, and industry. Our work spans the adoption of AI and emerging technologies; the resilience of U .S. 
supply chains; the protection of national critical infrastructure, and the increased operational effectiveness of our military in the battlespace and law enforcement responders at home .  
CNA’s  Center for AI and Autonomy (CAIA) . serves as a focal point for analytic efforts on AI, 
machine learning (ML), and autonomy. C AIA serves as coordination center to connect key 
stakeholders from the government, private sector, and academia, conduct ing analytics on AI 
adoption, use cases, prioritization, and feasibility for specific government functions. CAIA supports government decision -makers with data -driven analytics to effectively  incorporate AI in 
support of U.S. national and economic security. Also , our CNAi2  Innovation Incubator initiative 
supports continuous  invest ments  in internal projects to explore new AI tools and approaches for 
addressing emerging challenges  facing our clients.  We have implemented our own internal LLM 
system  based on governi ng policies compliant with current government information technology 
regulations and security requirements.  This approach helps CNA harness the benefits of AI while managing risks  and to responsibly test LLM tools and capabilities that could also prove beneficial 
to our clients .  Our  AI expertise includes:  
•Policy and Guidance Development:  CNA has
 collaborated with the FAA and NASA to
develop classification structures and certification plans for AI technologies. We have alsocreated maturity models to help federal agencies assess their AI capabilities and evaluated anagency’s “AI readiness, ” particularly the availability of foundational data necessary for these
systems.
•Strategic Foresight and Planning:  CNA has facilitated strategic working groups to evaluate
the risks, opportunities, and actions of emerging AI technologies. We have explored variousAI applications, financial implications, and gaps in learning and governance, ensuring that bothindustry and the public sector are involved.
•Technology Assessment and Implementation:  CNA has supported the development and
prototyping of AI solutions for the FAA, DoD, and other entities. Our work includesestablishing ML algorithm data engineering pipelines, developing AI use cases, and creatingframeworks for AI prioritization and certification.
CNA stands ready to support the Government’s efforts related to AI and offers the following ideas and suggestions for consideration.  
2.AI Focused Partnerships with the Private Sector
CNA suggests that new models for supporting and benefiting from the private sector is essential 
for maintaining U.S. supremacy in AI. Traditional public -private partnerships (PPPs), as well as 
alternative models such as joint ventures, alternative financin g structures, and the development of 
innovation funds or financing are essential for maintaining U.S. supremacy in AI. Through these 
collaborations the strengths of both sectors are leveraged to accelerate innovation, share resources, and address complex challenges. The private sector brings agility, cutting- edge technology, and 
significant investment in AI research and development, while the public sector provides strategic 


direction, regulatory oversight, and funding for foundational research. By working together, these 
partnerships can drive advancements in AI that are critical for national and homeland security.  
To foster effective public -private partnerships, CNA recommends that AI action plan specifically 
consider how to: 1) invest and/or motivate investment in U.S. -based AI technology development; 
2) drive investment in U.S. firms from our strategic allies; and  3)  put in place policies that drive
U.S. growth and AI dominance in the global AI market. The first step, enhancing  federal funding,
is crucial . Support for many types of collaborations (as outlined below) can help forge trusted
partnerships to address challenging issues in support of the public interest. Continued support forestablishing regulatory sandboxes is also important. This allows AI companies to test newtechnologies in a controlled environment without the full weight of regulatory constraints ,
helping to identify potential risks and benefits early in the development process. Additionally,developing secure data -sharing frameworks can facilitate access to high -quality datasets for AI
research while protecting privacy and sensitive information, encouraging collaboration between
public and private entities.
Talent development programs are also essential. Implementing programs that support STEM 
education for students pursuing AI -related fields, as well as creating pathways for AI experts to 
move between the public and private sectors, can help share knowledge and expertise. Furthermore, encouraging the formation of public -private research consortia can bring together 
government agencies, academic institutions, and private companies to work on AI projects of mutual interest, pooling resources and expertise to ta ckle complex challenges.  
CNA’s history of testing, evaluating, and identifying new technology for the Department of Defense, has always included strong connections across government, industry, and academia. CNA’s technologists are interdisciplinary , bringing expertise in computer science, operations 
research, engineering, and policy analysis . Examples of CNA -driven collaboration methods 
conducted for our federal  clients is summarized Table 1  below. This presents only a sample of 
options available to the government in this area.

Following, please find specific examples of CNA’s AI collaborations with public sector entities 
and the associated outcomes and benefits.   
Example 1: Horizon Scanning . CNA supports strategic foresight efforts at the Department of 
Homeland Security and the National Academy of Sciences by convening expert stakeholders from industry, academia, and government  to identify  processes and best practices around the  emerging 
trends in AI that impact various infrastructure sectors. This approach provides our clients with  
informed recommendations for strategic planning and enhances preparedness for emerging AI impacts. Further, CNA has also engaged law en forcement practitioners  and researchers to 
evaluating the opportunities, actions , and risks  of emerging technology/AI in corrections and 
policing. Using a futures analysis framework, we have facilitated strategic working groups focused on examining the world in 2040. Our experts have explored issues such as the various applications of AI technol ogies, financial implications for already strained government agencies, opportunities 
for improving the health and safety of incarcerated individuals and staff, and gaps in learning and governance related to AI. 
Example 2: Gaming and Exercises.  CNA has explored AI implementation and futures in a 
variety of games and exercises. For example, our gamers have brought decision- makers together 
to explore the operational, logistical, and strategic implications of AI for “intelligentized warfare” 
and for current and future unmanned systems. Our gaming approach for evaluating AI implementation is adaptable and can be used to examine a range of topics from AI integration in public safety, to AI integration with other systems, to adversary adoption of AI, and the use of AI in areas of instability or conflict.   Additional information on our gaming capabilities can be found 
on the CNA Website . 
Example 3: Advisory Boards : In support of AI Action Plan implementation, the government may 
consider leveraging a nd maintaining strategic partnerships through the establishment of an 
advisory board that guides initiative s and policy development . Effective  advisory boards consist 
of key spokespersons representing the initiatives partner organizations, public, and private sectors, and the user community. Specifically, advisory boards should also include those  who have 
expertise in the topic at hand (i.e. AI h ardware, software and implementation and its optimization ). 
A Federal AI Advisory Council, or similar, could include members such as:  
• Industry and Technology Leaders (Google DeepMind, NVIDIA, Shell AI, GridX),
•Department AI Officers, Commerce, State,  and other federal agencies (ARPA -E, DoD),
•University AI and Energy Research Centers (MIT energy Initiative, Carnegie Mello n AI Lab),
• Civil Society and Policy Experts
An advisory board would help drive cohesion in the development of the initiative while  foster ing 
collaboration among the industry and civil society groups in which they are embedded. In the past , 
CNA has brought these groups together to support the government with decisions ranging from 
the organizational design of US Space Force, the evaluation of the US information operations posture, and to identify approaches for stronger community preparedness  and emergency response . 
All these advisory boards open channels of communication between industry, government, and 
society that create connections between initiative priorities and additional engagement 
opportunities. 


3.AI and National Security
Maintaining supremacy in AI is critically important for the United States to ensure national 
security and global leadership. AI technologies provide a strategic advantage in military 
operations, enhance defense capabilities, and act as a force multiplier by increasing the efficien cy 
and effectiveness of military personnel and equipment. By staying at the forefront of AI innovation, the U.S. can deter adversaries, protect its critical infrastructure, and respond swiftly to emerging threats. Furthermore, AI l eadership enables the US to set global standards and norms 
promoting U.S. leadership worldwide. 
From a national security perspective, the ability to leverage AI for intelligence, surveillance, 
reconnaissance, cybersecurity, and autonomous systems is essential for maintaining a competitive edge over potential adversaries. Investment in AI research and  development, talent cultivation, and 
robust cybersecurity measures are key to sustaining this dominance. By implementing policies that support these areas, the U.S. can ensure that it remains at the cutting edge of AI technology, thereby safeguarding national security and reinforcing its position as a global leader in innovation and defens e. 
Application Areas.   There are myriad application  areas that are primed for AI breakthroughs 
across the military, science and applied energy  that could have  national security implications . From 
an implementation perspective, the AI Action Plan should support government and industry to effectively realize the breakthroughs. Following are some specific areas of potential breakthrough where CNA is already embedded with leadership and industry.   
CNA has supported development of AI 
algorithms for real- time analysis of video 
feeds from drones and satellites that can help create models to enhance object detection and tracking capabilities, improving situational awareness for military operations. CNA has also utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and interpret large volumes of intelligence data. Projects have focused on improving the extraction of relevant information from diverse sources, enabling more efficient and accurate threat 
assessments.  CNA’s supply chain 
applications in the AI arena include a deeper understanding of freight movement optimization and 
risk assessment to characterize patterns in vehicle flows and unlock strategies to alleviate bottlenecks while mitigating risks to communities or critical infrastructure. The ability to better characterize trucking and shipping involved in freight movement and cargo operations would help 
the US optimize global trade flows seasonally, reduce accidents and congestion, and r eroute traffic 
in case of operational disruptions ranging from accidents to piracy and acts of war. The magnitude of data and model training required to facilitate work in this area would require the resources that the Action Plan can detail and support.  
In the applied energy sector, aspects of fuel demand estimation and supply availability could 
benefit from AI to help monitor daily fuel usage at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Relatedly, 
AI Prioritization Use Case. CNA’s scientists 
are supporting the US Space Force (USSF) with 
an evaluation of how they could develop and apply AI applications across the service, given the current technical and structural limitations of these technologies. We created a “little- picture”  
framework for prioritization at the mission level and a “big- picture” framework for prioritization 
at the service level. We also identified how USSF might approach a service- level AI strategy 
and how the components of the AI pr ioritization 
frameworks would inform that strategy.  


fuel rack congestion monitoring through AI technologies can identify when truck racks at fuel 
terminals are experiencing long lines, while new facility capacity planning applications could identify where additional capacity for renewable diesel generation would be most feasible. Our development and implementation of the Supply Chain Analysis Network (SCAN) has increased 
our visibility and work on where AI could be integrated into the Energy supply in particular, and we would be happy to provide more information in this domain.  
Science applications  primed
 for breakthroughs include the characterization of cropland 
productivity and price forecasting where AI would help evaluate crop production and resulting 
market prices for key commodity crops to inform agricultural policy, international trade, water  
management, and biofuels/energy policy. Water stress and competition models are also primed for breakthroughs. They can be used to understand the nexus of federal and state water rights and management controls that are complicated and often prone to significant legal battles during times of water shortages. To that extent, AI applications could aid in understanding pricing or management strategies’ likely effects on water prices and resulting conservation behaviors.  
4.Governance of AI Responsibilities
To maintain the U .S.’s global leadership in AI, AI governance must be both structured and 
adaptable. This approach will support ongoing AI innovations while being responsive to new challenges. One consideration to ensure consistent and coordinated government oversight of AI 
activities  is the organizational structure for this function. Questions like whether a single 
Department , or a disaggregated structure would more successfully lead to streamline d policy 
development and implementation? And, which organiza tional structures would ensure a cohesive 
and strategic approach to maintaining AI dominance ?  
Current Structure. As noted in Table 2, current AI responsibilities are shared across multiple 
government organizations.  T he National AI Initiative Office (NAIIO), established by President 
Trump, coordinates federal efforts in AI research and policy. T he NAIIO plays a pivotal role in 
aligning various federal agencies ’ AI activities, promoting research and development, and ensuring 
the US  maintains its leadership in AI technologies.  
At one end of the organizational spectrum, the NAIIO could be  elevated to a formal Bureau or 
Department, its roles and responsibilities significantly strengthened, potentially bringing greater 
efficiency and authority to AI governance. As a Bureau or Department, it could consolidate AI oversight, lead collaborations, eliminate regulatory fragmentation across multiple agencies, and ensure a cohesive national AI strategy. With add ed authority, it could set enforceable AI standards, 
conduct risk assessments, and certify AI systems for safety, ethics, and transparency. 
A Bureau or Department structure could also streamline compliance for businesses by offering a 
single point of contact for AI regulations while fostering industry -driven innovation through 
public- private collaboration. Additionally, it could play a central  role in securing AI supply chains, 
mitigating AI risks, and aligning US AI leadership with global competitors. By bringing AI governance under one roof, the US could respond more quickly to emerging AI challenges, balance regulation with innovation, and m aintain its competitive edge in AI technologies.  
At the other end of the spectrum is a disaggregated organizational design, which allows for autonomy in decision- making on AI, and potentially more clarity on the feasibility of specific AI 
use cases. This disaggregated model can allow for systems to be developed that meet the direct and specific needs of a sub- organization. It can also distribute risk through a more diversified 


approach. This can be effective if the disaggregated organizational design also has a strong 
governance across agencies, bureaus, and offices to ensure consistency and standards.   
Table 2. Government -wide AI Responsibilities  
Agency/Organization  Primary AI Responsibilities  
National AI Initiative Office 
(NAIIO)  Coordinates federal AI efforts and policy across 
agencies.  
National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST)  Develops AI standards, risk frameworks, and safety 
guidelines.  
White House Office of Science 
and Technology Policy (OSTP)  Shapes national AI strategy, ethics, and R&D priorities. 
Department of Commerce (DOC)  Oversees AI’s economic impact, trade policies, and 
industry collaboration.  
Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC)  Regulates AI in consumer protection, data privacy, and 
fair competition.  
Department of Defense (DoD) / 
Joint AI Center (JAIC)  Develops and integrates AI in national security and 
military applications.  
Department of Energy (DOE) Advances AI for energy research, grid management, 
and climate solutions.  
National Security Commission on 
AI (NSCAI)  Advises on AI for defense, cybersecurity, and national 
security.  
Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)  Regulates AI in healthcare, medical devices, and 
diagnostics.  
Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC)  Monitors AI use in financial markets, fraud detection, 
and trading algorithms.  
U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office (USPTO)  Handles AI -related patents and intellectual property 
rights.  
Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS)  Uses AI for cybersecurity, border security, and threat 
detection.  
Need for a Unified Strategy. Regardless of where on the organizational spectrum AI decision -
making occurs, it is critical that a unified national strategy for AI, spearheaded by the AI Action 
Plan is in place. With an AI Action Plan in place, the goals and priorities of various governmental 
departments around AI will be aligned . The AI Action plan should drive the organizational design 
of the function, the   harmonizing of regulations across different sectors, and the avoi dance of  
overlaps and contradictory rules. It would ensure that clear guidelines and frameworks for AI 
development and deployment  are in place, and all agencies follow the same standards. Importantly, 
the AI Action Plan will provide a roadmap to resolve any conflicts that arise between different 
regulatory bodies regarding AI policies. 
Because AI is evolving rapidly, a unified national strategy for AI could spearhead and promote 
policies and regulations to manage responsible AI diffusion through effective export control 
policies, as currently being defined in the DOC’s Framework for AI Diffusion. It could provide national security oversight, including t hreat assessments to monitor global AI advancements and 
identify potential threats to national security, particularly from strategic competitors like China. It can facilitate collaboration across  intelligence agencies to analyze international AI developmen ts 


and their implications for U.S. security and support defense integration to ensure the U.S. defense 
apparatus incorporates cutting -edge AI technologies to maintain a strategic advantage.  
A successful recent example of a new organizational structure put in place to drive innovation was the establishment of U.S. Space Force. With a focus on innovation in space and new risks emerging in the space domain, U.S. Space Force represented the consolidation of defense space related missions. CNA played a pivotal role in the establishment of the foundation for the U.S. Space 
Force by developing a n organizational design for creating the separate military department. CNA’ s 
approach included an Operation al Environment Analysis, a Department Design for the new 
department and its subordinate divisions, and Risk Analysis and Legislative Modifications detailing the impacts on existing departments and the resources needed for its functions. 
Drawing parallels from the successful consolidation of space- related missions  for U.S. Space 
Force , a similar approach could be used to structure AI -related responsibilities . The goal would be 
to enhance the government's ability to achieve its goals of maintaining US supremacy in AI. The 
kinds of questions that would drive the approach would include (among others): 1.Centralized or Disaggregated Coordination : Which organizational structure promotes
efficient AI initiatives across various government sectors, ensuring a unified strategy and
efficient resource allocation.
2.Stakeholder Engagement : How to maximize e ngagement  with industry, academic, and
military stakeholders to gather insights and foster collaboration, like the approach taken for the
U.S Space Force?
3.Operational Environment and Gap Analysis : Conducting a thorough analysis of the current
AI landscape, identifying gaps, and proposing solutions to address these gaps.
4.Legislative and Policy Framework : Developing a robust legislative and policy framework to
support AI initiatives, ensuring compliance with ethical standards and internationalregulations.
5.Risk Management : Implementing a comprehensive risk management strategy to address
potential challenges and mitigate risks associated with AI development and deployment.
Of course, creating a new entity that either aggregates or disaggregated responsibilities would require strong leadership to navigate and address possible bureaucratic complexities to include Congressional approvals, buy in from industry, and agency turf w ars.     
CNA’s organizational design and AI technologists stand ready to assist  the government in building 
an effective AI oversight capability, driving innovation and maintaining a competitive edge in the global AI landscape . 
5.AI Research and Development (R&D)
R&D is crucial for the continuous innovation needed to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving field of AI. It helps develop new algorithms, models, and applications that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve. Investing in R&D ensures that the US remains at the forefront of technological advancements, enabling the development of cutting- edge AI technologies that can be leveraged 
across various sectors. Most critically, federal R&D funds can provide the upfront investment 
necessary for emergence of new U.S. based technologies to enter and grow in the market.  


Domestic benefits of R&D activities is the creat ion of  high- skilled jobs and a U.S.  competitive 
workforce. This contributes to economic growth and positions the US as a leader in the global AI 
market. Continuous R&D efforts help maintain the competitiveness of US industries by integrating AI into products and services, enhancing their value and global market appeal. Advanced AI technologies developed through R&D can enhance national security by improving defense systems, intelligence analysis, and operation al efficiencies.  
To truly support a competitive hardware ecosystem, the Action Plan  could include  additional 
investments to track, analyze, and explore broader trends, barriers, and opportunities influencing the trajectory of AI compute, and policy actions necessary to minimize future risks to American leadership. That may take the shape of partnership with organizations like CNA that have a history of working in the public -private partnership space with expertise in identifying and analyzing 
emerging AI trends and technologies that could have major implications for AI competitiveness and readiness.  This would include the tracking of domestic manufacturing capacity of advanced chips, securing underlying supply chains, understanding the potential ramifications of increasing adoption of open- source instruction sets (e.g., RISC -V), investing in and tracking progress in non -
silicon -based chips and hybrid systems, supporting efforts to address power availability 
challenges, and advancing packaging research and production. 
Leveraging government grants and c ontracts.  The Action Plan should emphasize new and 
expanded funding mechanisms including additional grants , contracts and new work under existing 
contracts targeting emerging AI technologies  and to promote ongoing innovation in the field.  In 
this context, leveraging the expertise of nonprofits can significantly enhance the effectiveness of 
AI initiatives.  
Nonprofit organizations like CNA are designed to support long- term analytic 
and development needs and offer several 
unique advantages to the government, 
particularly when addressing complex challenges and proposing effective solutions for AI integration in to agency 
mission -critical operations. Nonprofit 
organizations operate with a high degree of independence and objectivity, ensuring that their recommendations are unbiased. Unlike traditional contractors, nonprofits are not profit -driven and focus 
solely on the public interest and the 
government’s priority missions and goals. As a nonprofit, CNA does not have 
financial stakes in AI technologies. This independence ensures that our analysis and recommendations are free from commercial bias, providing government clients with impartial advice. Our evaluations of AI processes, systems, and programs are based solely on their merits and alignment with government objectives, leading to more accurate and trustworthy insights. This enables us to develop trusted, long -term relationships with government organizations, fostering 
deep institutional knowledge and continuity. This is particularly beneficial for complex and 
AI Technology Acquisitions . CNA’s scientists 
and analysts have, for decades, provided technical assessment and support to our clients around small - and large -scale technology 
buying/acquisitions. At the early stages, we conduct Analyses of Alternatives to provide decision- makers wi th a data -driven understanding 
of capability needs. Then, throughout the acquisition lifecycle, CNA provides analyses of return on investment; impact on manning, training, and education as new technologies are brought online; and continuous test and evalua tion to 
ensure that new technologies are best meeting the  
needs of the government.  


evolving fields like AI, where ongoing collaboration and understanding of agency- specific needs 
are crucial.  
For example, drawing on our extensive 80- year history of supporting the DoD, CNA has developed 
a unique capability to provide in -depth and reliable support for Navy AI efforts. This includes 
exploring new AI technologies, algorithms, and applications that can be integrated into Navy 
operations. Our research helps identify potential AI solutions for various challenges, from logistics and maintenance to combat systems and intelligence analysis. This includes testing AI systems in real-world scenarios to validate their performance and identify potential improvements.  
CNA also fosters interdisciplinary collaboration by bringing together experts from various fields, including computer science, engineering, operations research, and social sciences. This collaborative approach ensures that AI solutions are comprehensive an d consider multiple 
perspectives, enhancing their effectiveness and applicability. 
Prize Based Challenges .  Prize -based challenges or competitions are another mechanism used to 
drive innovation in AI technologies and encourage industry to develop AI - based technologies and 
solutions to support mission critical services that serve the public interest. The Action Plan should 
support innovation through encouraging and supporting competitions  managed by specific 
government organizations . For example, the recent NIST Artificial Intelligence for Industrial 
Internet (AI3) Challenge sought AI solutions to support First Responders exchanging data and 
providing situational awareness in emergency situations . CNA d evelop ed a system that uses AI to 
ingest, fuse, classify, and analyze known and unknown IoT sensor data into an intuitive data visualization interface for first responders and unit commanders .   
We suggest structuring the challenges in stages that move through concept, prototype, and live 
demo. Important to keep in mind when developing a prize -based competition is how the goal of 
the competition is formulated and published, the use cases provided to competitors, the system 
requirements, and overall scoring criteria. These bounding criteria should be developed to specifically support strategic priorities and the goals to  drive innovation. 
6.Summary
