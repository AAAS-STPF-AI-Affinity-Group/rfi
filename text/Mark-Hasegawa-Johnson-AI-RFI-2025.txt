Public education is successful in America because of the brilliance and dedication of
American schoolteachers.   In the coming AI economy, every American will work with AI
collaborators all the time or lose the ability to work.   An AI that can speak to very young
children, and understand their speech, is an AI that can collaborate with both teachersand children to teach children the skills they need.
  The Federal government should
support the creation of AI capable of speaking to very young children and understandingtheir speech.
