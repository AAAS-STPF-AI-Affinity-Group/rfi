General Comment
AI dom inance is a scam . The whole thing is just tech billionaires trying to reap a return on investm ent. The technology is furthering the
destruction of the environm ent, taking away jobs, and furthering the divides that have been only widening between the rich and the poor
and between races.
As it stands there is next to nothing being done to truly regulate this technology and tim e and tim e again articles com e out about how
copyright protections being enforced effectively kill the tech. THAT should be a clear sign of what its built on.
Those at the top, very clearly, don't care because if they have their way they get to pocket even m ore m oney by laying off m ore people.
There's no jobs being created by this in an environm ent where people are ALREADY losing their jobs at the whim  of the people at the
top.
While AI m ay "just be a tool" it is currently a tool in the hands of the wealthy, the hands of the authoritarians, the hands of the bigots. A
tool that in those hands will actively destroy rather than build up not only this country but the rest of the world.
