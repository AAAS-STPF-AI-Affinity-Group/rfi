General Comment
Letting AI com panies scrape unowned data to train m odels will not im prove national security nor the econom y. 
Hundreds of thousands of creatives would lose their jobs and livelihoods in an econom y already suffering from  unem ploym ent and poor
wages. 
Allowing the scraping of copyrighted m aterials also sets a bad legal precedent to underm ine copyright protection, threatening the stability
of the entertainm ent and inform ation sectors of the econom y. 
The data these com panies are collecting for training is also at m assive risk of being leaked to our foreign enem ies through data breaches
and reverse engineering. 
Do not allow AI com panies to train on copyrighted m aterial or anything not (optionally) given to be used for training.
