General Comment
I am  an author, and have been for nearly 20 years. Allowing AI com panies to use m y work and violate m y copyright will rob m e of m y
ability to continue in m y chosen career. These com panies should not be allowed to profit off the intellectual property of artists and authors,
and should be allowed to destroy the environm ent while doing so.
The AI m odel proposed by these com panies is unsustainable, and a waste of resources and m oney.
