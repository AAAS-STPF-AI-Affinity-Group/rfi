General Comment
Analytical AI is great. Analytical AI advances science and progress and is a boon.
Generative AI is hallucinogenic slop trained on stolen works.
Protections m ust be put in place that prevent corporations from  stealing the hard work of Am ericans without consent or com pensation to
produce a sub-par product that doesn't even deliver on it's own over-inflated prom ise. Several copyright rulings have all ready shown
these com panies have zero ownership of what their AI "creates", because algorithm ically generate slop was not created by a person. It
m akes zero sense to keep funding this with taxpayer dollars, and it m ust be clear that the ingenuity of hard-working individuals rem ains
protected from  corporations.
