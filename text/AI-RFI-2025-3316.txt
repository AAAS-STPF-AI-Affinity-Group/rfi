General Comment
Hello! I am  a digital artist who works in the sphere of 2D design and iconography. I work as a self-em ployed freelance creator on this
m aterial and am  very m uch im pacted by the use of AI in our m odern tim e.
AI-generated im agery and m aterial unlawfully violates the copyright of so m any creators' content every day, and takes away m oney from
living, breathing Am ericans such as m yself. I am  against generative AI with every fiber of m y being. Please do not give it any m ore
infrastructure or even acceptance. I vote with this in m ind.
