General Comment
Generative AI as it is now is a waste of resources. It's using up fresh water to cool servers that we don't have the excess for. It's driving
up the cost electricity in urban centers where these servers are installed. And it's all powered on plaugerizing copyrighted works.
If I were to scan a copy of a picture drawn by Disney and try to sell it, I'd be sued for copyright infringm ent. But if I sell an AI m odel
designed to look like Disney works, trained by scanning their pictures. That is currently being allowed. We have enough double standards
in our governm ent as is.
