General Comment
This proposal is a ludicrous and disingenous attem pt to utterly devalue all intellectual property--not to m ention flout copyright laws--to
further em power and enrich tech oligarchs in the supposed nam e of the greater good. Generative AI is not, in fact, AI, but is rather a
waste of power and destruction of the environm ent to create a m ore powerful predictive text algorithm . The fact that their industry
survives only thanks to regular injections of cash from  venture capitalists should be an indicator that there is nothing of any value there, and
for you to pronounce that all intellectual property is now beholden to their cynical and em pty efforts is appalling.
