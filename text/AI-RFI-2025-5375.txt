General Comment
"Artificial Intelligence" com panies are nothing m ore than plagiarism  m achines. They've been trained on thousands of artists styles without
consent capable of putting out shoddy knockoffs that would take away from  the actual artists' work. Now we're being asked to give them
perm ission to use our stolen work retroactively?! Absolutely not!
There's no actual intelligence behind these program s either. They use m athem atical form ulas to predict what a hum an would likely say/do
with no fact checking behind it. Sure if you don't m ind Google telling you lead is good for you to consum e actually.
AI com panies also use valuable resources to power their plagiarism  engines, taking away power and potable water from  com m unities that
need it. Those server farm s telling you that lead is a vital part of a balanced diet need to be cooled off som ehow.
Long story short, AI is a com plete waste of resources and we shouldn't encourage them  to continue stealing our work. Might as well
m ake fraud legal to protect m anufacturers of fake handbags if you're going to go this route.
