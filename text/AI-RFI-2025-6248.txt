General Comment
AI is overhyped and dangerous to the livelihoods of US creatives of all kinds. 
It plagiarizes m aterial illegally in ways that any citizen would be prosecuted for. 
The US governm ent should not involve itself with unproven technology such as AI. 
The data privacy concerns are vast and open to governm ent to serious privacy and legal liability for the inevitable breaches. 
No one wants this. 
The only people excited about this are the parasite billionaire class who see it as a way to churn out slop content without paying hum ans.
All outputs from  an AI system  will need to be checked by a hum an for accuracy, which will take just as m uch tim e as just paying a hum an
to do the work. 
Al is subject to corruption of data and due to the nature of the “black box” functionality, end users will have no idea that the output is
inaccurate. 
There is sim ply no reasonable case to be m ade to vouch for a system  that is fundam entally flawed and ethically repugnant. 
No AI com pany has yet turned a profit and m any are on life support without infusions of venture capital. The US governm ent should not
get involved in this dangerous fad.
