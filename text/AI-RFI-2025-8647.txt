General Comment
I am  a high school teacher. I am  very concerned at the push for teachers to use generative AI/LLMs in the classroom . The lack of ethics
around the technology com m unicates exactly the wrong things to our students. Students learn that taking work without credit and
reproducing it or regurgitating it as their own constitutes "writing" or even "thinking." This is a danger not just to academ ics but to Am erica,
as a future generation of potential scientists, doctors, educators, and, yes, CEOs and politicians are going to lack the critical thinking skills
and ethical com passes they will need to "m ake Am erica great."
