General Comment
The stated purpose of the executive order is "to ensure that unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents do not ham per private sector AI
innovation." Those "burdensom e requirem ents" include copyright law. No, I do not support the legalization of intellectual property theft for
the purposes of AI developm ent.
