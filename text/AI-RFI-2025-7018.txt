General Comment
AI is not a useful or sustainable resource worth investing in. It does not generate anything that people have not already generated
them selves, therefore all it is capable of is taking jobs from  Am ericans. If an industry relies on content theft to survive, it should not
survive. Autom ation is already available via other m ethods; AI does not offer im provem ents that don't already exist in m ore ethical form s.
Investing in AI is just going to result in wasting federal funds in countless court battles due to ram pant unlawful use. Major com panies are
already backing down from  their plans involving AI after seeing that it is not useful or sustainable. AI sows confusion and m isinform ation
online when m istrust is already at an all-tim e high. Resources should only be invested to control and counter AI, not increase its usage. AI
does not increase accessibility; accessibility is already available through other m ore ethical m eans, and should be invested in further rather
than investing into AI. AI is not worth the large am ount of resources it takes to generate, especially considering som e parts of the country
can't even m aintain steady resources for their current utilities.
