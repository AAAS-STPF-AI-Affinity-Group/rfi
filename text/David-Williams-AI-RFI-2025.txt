TWIMC,
To be a global leader in AI, the U.S needs to incentivize the best and brightest to work here in
America on American problems.   I propose a simple solution:
Create a worldwide job offer:1.) Incentives
  -Tax free bonus $500k per year $100k a year guaranteed (similar to a military enlistment
bonus, only TAX FREE)
 -Guaranteed work visa, glide path to U S. citizenship
2.) Criteria  
 -Must have a proven novel use of machine learning or AI that solve(s/d) a complex industry
problem 
 -Must agree to work for DoD R/D organization such as DARPA, Navy Research Laboratory,
Idaho National Lab, etc.  
 -Must be willing to relocate and if not already a U.S. citizen, swear oath of office and/or pass
clearance requirements  
  
Very respectfully,David Williams
