General Comment
I believe that AI in it's current form  is m ore dam aging to society than it is helpful and that unrestricted use will directly harm  the working
class by elim inating jobs, and directly harm  the planet with excessive energy usage. while I recognize AI can be useful in certain
applications, I believe over im plem entation will ultim ately harm  our society and the species and restrictions on AI's use should be put in
place.
