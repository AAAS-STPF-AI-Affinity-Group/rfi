General Comment
Generative AI does nothing but rob Am ericans of their incom e, and is bad for the environm ent. It is a rip off that will destroy the country
and the world, it has to be stopped. If Open AI has to steal in order to thrive, it should not be allowed to exist. There should be no future
from  technology that does nothing but rip off people.
