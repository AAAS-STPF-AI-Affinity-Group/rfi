General Comment
Many regulations on AI *should* be burdensom e in order to ensure that it is used in beneficial ways. In particular, regulations should
m ake it clear that reliance on AI cannot be used as a m eans to avoid liability in cases where a hum an being m aking the sam e decision
would be considered negligent; it cannot be used as a defense against charges of discrim ination, where bias in the training data produces
an identifiable bias against groups having various protected characteristics, such as race or disability; and it cannot be used as a defense
against copyright infringem ent, where the unauthorized use of copyrighted work in training datasets results in econom ic harm  (whether
im m ediate and provable or the speculative long-term  result) to authors and other copyright owners. If AI firm s believe they can't
com pensate authors fairly for the use of their data and still turn a profit, then that m eans that the resulting AI tools are a net loss to society
once externalities are properly accounted for, and so the loss of these tools is a net gain for hum anity.
