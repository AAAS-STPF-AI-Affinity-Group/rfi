General Comment
I would like to see AI im plem ented into all aspects of governm ent to help ensure that taxpayers dollars are being spent wisely, after seeing
what D.O.G.E has already uncovered I think oversight from  the tech sector is a m ust and can reduce the need for hum an jobs inside
governm ent. Thank Anthony
