General Comment
I do not believe AI is the future. AI is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs, with false prom ises to fool the public and
huge legal problem s by enabling them . AI system s are already m ining their out output for new content, requiring m assive am ounts of
power for increasingly nonsensical results.
