Alessia Padalino,  
My name is Alessia Padalino, and I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth 
High S chool. I completed a semester course on AI and Ethics and studied the impacts of 
Generative AI on the surgical field of medicine. EO 14179, removing regulations, will both improve and disrupt the surgical field of medicine and policy about research and development based on research conducted on the impact of Generative AI in cosmetic surgery, cancer removal surgery, and the overall goal of customizable medicine . There are already forms of AI used in 
these fields of surgery, such as Generative AI imaging and tools. These have improved patient care by allowing the surgeon to be more accurate, causing lower complication and death rates. Therefore, removing regulati ons will allow for more tools to be created to help patient care even 
more. In comparison, removing regulations could also lead to disruption in the surgical field. These imaging tools require all patient information to be accurate in the image they are producing. Having all the patient information in a single source could lead to complications in the system where private information is shared. This would be disruptive for both the patient and the surgeon involved. Overall, this executive order will definitely cause surgeons to provide better care for their patients, but there are risks that could be disruptive.
