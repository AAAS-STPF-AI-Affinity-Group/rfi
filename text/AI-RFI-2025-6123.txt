General Comment
We're taught from  an early age that if you work hard and dedicate yourself too your craft, you can succeed in Am erica. As a writer, I
have done exactly that. Writing is m y livelihood, for which I should be fairly com pensated. AI cannot duplicate the creativity and
innovation of hum an thought, and yet AI com panies are willing to steal m y work to train their deeply flawed program s. 
The United States doesn't need AI to succeed - in fact, the errors these program s introduce put us in m ore danger. We should instead
encourage, support, and pay hum an beings to do the jobs Open AI and sim ilar com panies would take from  hardworking Am ericans and
those who com e to this country seeking opportunities and contributing to its success.
