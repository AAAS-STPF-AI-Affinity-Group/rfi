General Comment
Com puters cannot be held responsible for their decisions. How is this in any way, shape, or form , going to m ake Am erica "better"? We
the people fail to see any logical progress this would give us. You are only serving the betterm ent of yourselves, not the Am erican people,
by attem pting to give AI which has been thoroughly proved tim e and tim e again to give, at best, inaccurate inform ation, scraped from
aggregate data and conversations am idst the internet, and at worst, harm ful and legitim ately deadly "inform ation."
Do not do this. We are begging you.
