General Comment
Hello,
This bill should not pass for the great devastation and lim itation it would bring to the public in creative direction and public inform ation. We
can't allow such AI to take control of these fields or be given the freedom  to take from  whom ever or why. 
Trum p and his adm inistration has proven they can't be given control or allow such control with AI on data or freedom  of it, with seeing the
current poor decisions being m ade in our econom ic governm ent.
This bill shouldn't pass for how it would negatively affect our creative endeavors and the tread forward in our artistic works and
presentations to the public. Do not let this bill pass. It will not go down the way you think it will if it does.
