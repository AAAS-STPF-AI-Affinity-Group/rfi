General Comment
I am  not against AI com pletely. But there's a problem  when people use it to generate art of any kind, whether it's m usic or drawings or
scripts or even program m ing code.
The overwhelm ing consensus am ong the art com m unities is that they do not consent for AI to be trained on their work. So that should be
respected.
But what about when consent is given? Well, in fact, a lot of open source code that's super perm issive, such as the MIT and BSD-2-
clause licenses, still require attribution. AI does not give attribution; therefore, I would like to see the law reflect that even a perm issive
license like that can have teeth against generative AI. No attribution possible? Then you can't train your AI on it, because AI can and will
spit out line-for-line copyrighted open-source code.
