General Comment
This is an absolutely ridiculous proposition that's counter to everything that m akes Am erica Am erica, to say nothing of the ethics of the
situation. This is wrong, pathetic, disgusting, and anyone involved with it should be asham ed for pitching it.
Generative AI - Open AI, Dall-E, Midjourney - is a scam . It has been a scam  and will continue to be a scam . It's being pushed hard by
the sam e people who brought us cryptoscam s and NFTs. It does not hold a place in the future of the United States of Am erica and is
overhyped and poorly understood by its users.
Further, as a writer - both professionally and as an avocation - generative AI steals from  m y livelihood. I hate Ayn Rand with from  the
bottom  of m y heart, but people pitching AI love her and her terrible book, "Atlas Shrugged." And if there has ever actually been anything
in the United States that resem bles the paranoid frenzy of "but these people are parasites!" at the core of that book, it's generative AI.
Absolute dullards incapable of creation and hungry to steal and m onetize their ill-gotten gains dem and to train their plagiarism  engines on
the work of actual laborers and creators. They're stealing from  geniuses to sustain them selves.
Owners and pushers of generative AI are parasites. They're unAm erican. They're m onsters. They care only about them selves and are
pushing a flawed, garbage technology on the Am erican people - who by and large despise it. 
Do not allow this. It is legalized theft.
