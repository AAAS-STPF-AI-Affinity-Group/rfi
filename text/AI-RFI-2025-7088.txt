General Comment
AI has actively hurt m y industry and m y peers. It has m ajor environm ental im pacts. It hurts the education system , and is built on stolen
work. 
AI, as it exists and is used, has no place in our society. 
I do not wish for m y work to be used to train it. I do not wish for m y data to be used to train it.
