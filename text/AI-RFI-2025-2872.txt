General Comment
Aym ara is a com pany that develops AI alignm ent tools and works with enterprises. We believe strongly that advancing the "Right to
Align" unlocks AI innovation, strengthening Am erican econom ic com petitiveness, and ensuring national security.
The "Right to Align" is the idea that users—organizations and individual consum ers—should have the ability to shape and custom ize the AI
they rely on. This principle is directly inspired by the "Right to Repair" m ovem ent, which has allowed consum ers to fix and m odify their
devices rather than being locked into restrictive m anufacturer controls. Just as the Right to Repair has driven com petition, lowered costs,
and given users m ore control over their technology, the Right to Align can bring sim ilar benefits to the AI ecosystem .
AI alignm ent capabilities ensure AI is reliable, effective, and aligned with user needs. Custom izable AI not only im proves outcom es for
users but also expands AI's potential in critical sectors such as healthcare, defense, and cybersecurity. As geopolitical com petition over AI
technology intensifies, ensuring that Am erican-developed AI is flexible and adaptable will m aintain national security and econom ic
leadership.
To advance this goal, the United States should prom ote industry-driven standards that encourage user-configurable AI. Public-private
partnerships and targeted incentives can accelerate the developm ent of alignm ent tools while ensuring custom ization practices align with
industry best practices. By fostering collaboration between AI providers, enterprises, and policym akers, the United States can create a
robust fram ework for responsible, effective AI custom ization that supports innovation and security.
Prom oting the Right to Align can strike a thoughtful balance between AI custom ization and intellectual property protection. The Right to
Repair m ovem ent has shown that controlled access to repair tools and software can balance innovation with proprietary interests.
Sim ilarly, industry-wide standards for AI alignm ent ensure that custom ization em powers users without underm ining incentives for AI
developm ent. By leading the effort to define best practices that balance flexibility with safeguarding AI investm ents, the United States
prom otes innovation while protecting AI advancem ents.
AI alignm ent tools should be designed with accessibility, usability, and flexibility in m ind. Making these tools available to a broad range of
stakeholders—including sm aller organizations and independent developers—dem ocratizes AI and enables innovation to thrive at all levels.
When m ore people can shape AI, we create a m ore open and resilient AI landscape.
We urge the Adm inistration to m ake the Right to Align a central pillar of its AI Action Plan. Policies that prom ote alignm ent transparency,
user adaptability, and custom ization will ensure that AI serves the interests of its users while advancing Am erican leadership in AI
innovation and security. By taking this approach, the United States establishes itself as a global leader in adaptable AI while fostering a
m ore open and em powered AI ecosystem .
