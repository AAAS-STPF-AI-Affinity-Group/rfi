General Comment
Please don't give any m ore tim e or energy or financial support to what is essentially an industry explicitly based on copyright violation if not
outright theft. If these m achines explicitly cannot function without the input of m aterial stolen from  the labor of hum an creative activity, then
the business m odel driving those m achines deserves to fail, since they can neither adapt, overcom e, or truly innovate.
