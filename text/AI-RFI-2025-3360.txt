General Comment
I can genuinely only call this presented potential order repulsive and sham eful to the Am erican people. It would give m assive corporations
a free pass to further exploit the creative workers of this country they have already adm itted they scraped data and works from  to m ake
their m ass plagiarism  m achines (known as Generative AI.) As an Am erican that has worked in a creative field for years now, this will
cause irreparable harm  to Am ericans by enabling a cheap m arket substitute that relies on the works of those sam e Am ericans to exist, as
well as m illions of creatives globally. These corporations are in the process of losing m ultiple lawsuits for their own failure to respect
copyright laws in training the m odels these generative AI system s are based on. 
If this order is m ade into law, it will be another nail in the coffin that this adm inistration, and this governm ent as a whole, have given up on
pretending they care for the well-being and livelihood of their constituents. The destruction of creative industries, and m any m ore industries
to follow, will be easily traced back to this order and those like it. 
I will personally be watching closely as this order is assessed. Anyone that votes to approve this into law is som eone I never want to give
m y vote or support again if I can help it. And I will m ake sure m y fellow colleagues know who does, and does not, have our best interest
as an industry, so they can vote accordingly as well.
