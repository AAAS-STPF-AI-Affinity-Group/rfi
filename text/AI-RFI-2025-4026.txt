General Comment
OpenAI is a grift, and anyone with sense can see that. Art m eans nothing without an artist behind it to give m eaning and soul. There is no
benefit to advancing this technology, it won't even be able to sustain itself. Existing artists and creators are already having their livelihoods
stolen from  them , allowing this on a larger scale is dangerous and downright irresponsible.
