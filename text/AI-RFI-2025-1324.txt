General Comment
My nam e is Alessia Padalino, and I am  a m em ber of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High School. I com pleted a sem ester
course on AI and Ethics and studied the im pacts of Generative AI on the surgical field of m edicine. EO 14179, rem oving regulations, will
both im prove and disrupt the surgical field of m edicine and policy about research and developm ent based on research conducted on the
im pact of Generative AI in cosm etic surgery, cancer rem oval surgery, and the overall goal of custom izable m edicine. There are already
form s of AI used in these fields of surgery, such as Generative AI im aging and tools. These have im proved patient care by allowing the
surgeon to be m ore accurate, causing lower com plication and death rates. Therefore, rem oving regulations will allow for m ore tools to be
created to help patient care even m ore. In com parison, rem oving regulations could also lead to disruption in the surgical field. These
im aging tools require all patient inform ation to be accurate in the im age they are producing. Having all the patient inform ation in a single
source could lead to com plications in the system  where private inform ation is shared. This would be disruptive for both the patient and the
surgeon involved. Overall, this executive order will definitely cause surgeons to provide better care for their patients, but there are risks
that could be disruptive.
