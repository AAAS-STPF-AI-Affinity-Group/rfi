General Comment
Regulations designed to m aintain the integrity of creative industry and intellectual property are not "unnecessarily burdensom e
requirem ents". The only people that these laws hinder are thieves and plagiarists. The regulations are in place to protect regular people in
creative industries like m yself and m y peers, and large IP holders both. 
Generative AI does not benefit the people. It hurts the people, and burns m oney that could be spent im proving lives in tangible ways.
Please do not hurt our country m ore by enabling thieves and plagiarists to destroy our livelihoods.
