General Comment
Generative AI com panies have been m ass plagiarizing m achines since their inception. It is sim ply ridiculous they have been allowed to
continue on this long, especially without regulations and transparency. If there is any way to protect artists, creators, and the privacy of
every single person who uses the internet from  generative AI com panies plagiarizing all their work and their online presence, we need to
enact that as soon as we can. We needed to enact it years ago.
