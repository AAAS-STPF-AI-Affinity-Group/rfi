General Comment
Artificial intelligence m ust not be granted access to private intellectual property without proper paym ent to creators. This kind of
governm ent sanctioned plagiarism  harm s Am erica's creative industries, which are am ong our greatest and m ost powerful exports.
Am erican m ovies, m usic, television, and com ic books have perm anently reshaped global culture, and allowing that effect to be watered
down by the intrusion of artificial intelligence will ultim ately dam age the US econom y beyond repair.
