An Imperative Strategic Shift: Acknowledging a Roadmap Deficit  
With the People Republic of China’s (PRC) 2027 and 2035 military modernization milestones on the horizon, America’s perceived strategic advantage is a precarious illusion.
1 The PRC’s ability 
to eventually synergize advancements in AI with domains such as cyber, autonomy, and science will equip them with the capabilities and influence to transform the existing world order, an 
objective they are committed to realizing.
2 The United States (U.S.) has been riding a wave of 
technological complacency, not due to a lack of innovation but because groundbreaking advancements are failing to translate into national strategic capabilities. Vannevar Bush’s  words 
still ring true, “A nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position in world trade.” But despite 
significant investments and numerous technological breakthroughs, there is a disconnect between innovation and its effective integration into the strategic national capabilities that bolster integrated 
deterrence. Innovation fueled by government investments is a challenge well addressed in today’s 
ecosystem; the National Science Foundation continues to lead in driving critical investments. 
Investments alone do not translate into tailored capabilities for the U.S. to capitalize on. The real 
challenge comes in integration. In former Google Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr. Eric 
Schmidt’s comments to the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) in 2018, he stated that “the 
DoD does not have an innovation problem. It has an innovation adoption problem.” The crux of the issue is that “while change has inherent risk, … there is more at stake by maintaining the status 
quo in the face of quickly-evolving security threats and adversaries that are accelerating their 
technological advancement… with this in mind, everyone in the world - including US competitors 
- has equal access to the technology.”
3 The innovation adoption bottleneck persists and is only
exacerbated by the increasing speed and impact of new AI innovations. This gap has resulted inmissed opportunities to harness these advancements for maintaining and enhancing U.S. strategic
dominance, particularly in the face of rapid progress by global competitors like the PRC.

3 Statement  of Dr. Eric Schmidt House Armed Services Committee April  17, 2018  


      -  AI Action Plan 2 The rapid and comprehensive modernization of China’s military directly challenges U.S. and allied 
dominance in the Indo-Pacific region.4 The PRC increasingly views warfare as a confrontation 
between opposing operational systems rather than annihilation between opposing military forces that are mechanical in nature. This perspective has shifted the PRC’s transformation goals from 
largely mechanical in focus towards an information dominance one, enabling them to fight 
intelligence-fueled warfare effectively.
5 Thus, significant investments directed by the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) have been funneled into PRC industry as well as their R&D sector to support this goal.
6,7 From 2014 to 2023, PRC inventors filed 38,000 patents in the generative AI 
domain, with the Chinese Academy of Sciences contributing 1,100 of those. In stark contrast, top U.S. industry and science institutions collectively filed only 6,300 patents in the same period, with 
Stanford University accounting for 600 of those.
8  We have an urgent need to not only maintain an 
industrial ecosystem that can drive innovation, but also establish new avenues for government to 
integrate them more seamlessly into tailored capabilities that can bolster a strategic advantage.   
Harnessing Knowledge for National Strength  
To secure victory in the current era of great power competition, the United States (U.S.) requires a robust and comprehensive strategy that clearly defines the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 
strategic position. This strategy must not only operationalize our capabilities against our 
adversaries but also integrate AI technologies that abide by U.S. and allied values. In the current 
geopolitical landscape, winning great power competition entails continually outpacing adversaries and applying tailored instruments of national power to elicit behavioral changes that advance any 
nations’ core interests.
9 Great power competition has traditionally been measured through a blend 
of hard and soft power through military strength, economic leverage, and diplomatic influence. Today, however, that landscape has shifted; knowledge has emerged as a critical indicator of 
national power.
10 The generation of new knowledge and how it is applied can enhance both hard 
and soft power while restricting another nation’s ability to develop such knowledge provides a 
strategic technological advantage. 
In any competitive domain, the key to victory for any person, organization, or nation lies in 
generating, applying, and controlling knowledge faster and more effectively than their adversary. 
This requires more than just data lakes; it requires data to be part of a system that creates actionable, 
useful knowledge.  AI is key to transforming information stored within unmanageable datasets into 
knowledge. This principle holds true in great power competition, especially in the 21st century where the world is immensely more complex than any prior decade. The vast array of variables 
that shape the competitive landscape often leads to situations where the best course of action may 
be inaction. In this intricate environment, ongoing integrated deterrence is crucial to prevent great power competition from escalating into full-scale conflict. Integrated deterrence does not have an 
end state; it is a living challenge that requires continual iteration and adaptation in order to prevent 
spiraling into war. While the U.S. stands ready to address such conflicts, if necessary, leveraging

10 The Crumbling Foundations of American Strength  


      -  AI Action Plan 3 AI to achieve effective integrated deterrence offers significant advantages. Our key adversaries in 
the 21st century have both adopted national security strategies that reflect the concept of integrated 
deterrence (integrated strategic deterrence and sderzhivanie), and show a clear intent to fight and 
gain the advantage in operating within a multi-domain environment using AI11,12. Each of 
America’s adversaries are different, and to out-compete the PRC and contain Russia, winning 
integrated deterrence means that the U.S needs a comprehensive AI roadmap applied to 
government, industry, and scientific discovery.13 The AI roadmap we lay out is much broader than 
just military application; we focus on how to keep the U.S. competitive edge. Our AI roadmap is a comprehensive strategy designed to ensure the U.S. maintains its competitive edge across various 
sectors. The focus is on maintaining a holistic national dominance in the economy (industry), 
scientific discovery, and national defense. The perpetual need for adaptation through integration 
highlights the critical role of knowledge and innovation, an area where the U.S. has had a longstanding competitive advantage. To succeed in great power competition, nations must adeptly 
apply and manage a healthy, AI-integrated ecosystem across the spheres of government, science, 
and industry to build an ongoing competitive advantage for them and their allied partners.  
The Role of Government, Science, and Industry  
In the context of great power competition, the traditional roles of government, science, and 
industry must be complementary and interdependent, each contributing to the broader national interest through distinct yet interconnected functions. Historically, the government's role has centered on providing direction and resources by paying for the fundamental research, development and production of capabilities, particularly during critical periods such as World War II (WWII) and the Cold War. During these times, the U.S. government acted as the primary financier and organizer of large-scale research and development initiatives that were instrumental in establishing the U.S. as a technological and military superpower. In this traditional framework, 
advances in science have served as the engine of innovation, fueled by direct government 
investment driving the creation of new knowledge and technologies. The academic and research 
institutions, often funded by government grants, were pivotal in advancing the foundational theories and discoveries that would be harnessed for national defense and other strategic purposes. This drove advances in technologies that had military or national security applications as their priority (i.e., stealth technologies and GPS), but then led to commercial applications as well.  
The symbiotic relationship between government and science helped ensure that cutting-edge 
research was aligned with national priorities, leading to breakthroughs that were not only scientifically significant but also strategically advantageous. On the other hand, industry has been the primary agent of applying and scaling these scientific advancements into practical, operational technologies. The private sector's role in manufacturing, technology development, and commercialization has been crucial in translating scientific discoveries into tangible assets that can be deployed nationally and globally. The defense industrial base (DIB), driven by direct government requirements and funding, exemplifies this dynamic, where industry partners followed the government funding and led in developing and producing the sophisticated technologies that 
11 Page 96, U.S. Department of Defense, Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China, 2023  
12 Page 12, Integrated Deterrence as a Defense Planning Concept  
13 Page 23, National Security Strategy, October 2022  


      -  AI Action Plan 4 defined the 20th century. In this traditional model, innovation, and technology advancements 
focused on national security followed a relatively linear path: the government set the requirements 
and provided funding; the government invested in scientific discovery focused on generating the necessary knowledge; and industry brought that knowledge to the market or battlefield. Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a clear example of the U.S. Government’s requirements and desires to possess a fifth-generation stealth fighter. Fundamental science needed to be pushed through 
innovations to enable the development of a fifth-generation stealth fighter. Lockheed Martin then brought them to market for the U.S. and now additional countries as well.
14 
However, this paradigm is evolving in the 21st century, particularly with the rise of AI and other advanced technologies. Science, in particular national labs and academia, continues to play a 
critical role in foundational research, but it must also adapt to the faster pace of technological 
development driven by industry. In this environment, Former Secretary Mattis's words particularly ring true, “Success no longer goes to the country that develops a new fighting technology first, but rather to the one that better integrates it and adapts its way of fighting…Our response will be to prioritize speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and frequent modular upgrades. We must not accept cumbersome approval chains, wasteful applications of resources in uncompetitive space, or overly risk-averse thinking that impedes change.”
15 The roles between industry and government 
are becoming more fluid, with the industry now driving much of the technological innovation and the government struggling to adopt innovate, particularly in information technology, which is 
surpassing the pace of government-funded integration, adoption, and bureaucracy. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of how these sectors interact. While still essential in setting policy and strategic direction, the government must now focus on creating an environment that fosters rapid innovation and ensures national security without stifling the dynamism of the private sector. Meanwhile, the information technology industry has assumed a more prominent role as the primary innovator. For example, the Magnificent 7 Stocks (MAG7) are leading in the deployment of AI and infrastructure investments to train more powerful AI models.
16 Today, there is an inherent 
symbiotic relationship between the MAG7 companies and small and medium sized businesses (SMBs); OpenAI would not exist without Microsoft’s infrastructure to train the GPT-series models and DeepMind would not exist without Google’s infrastructure. Without the MAG7’s money and GPUs, fundamental research breakthroughs emerging from industry would not be possible. To maintain a competitive edge in knowledge creation in an environment where large technology 
companies are leading in advancements, the traditional operating model between government, 
science, and industry needs to change. The U.S. and its allies should focus less on developing 
capabilities and more on: fostering the ecosystem, leveraging the investments already made, and 
integrating the advances to maintain the U.S.’s competitive edge in great power competition. 
Government’s Evolving Role in a Techno- Centric  21st Century 
During WWII and the Cold War, centralized high-tech research efforts funded directly by the 
government demonstrated the decisive role of technological innovation at home in shaping

      -  AI Action Plan 5 global outcomes. The government’s combined investments into the Manhattan Project and 
Aerospace Race gave birth to a crucial defense industrial base and specialized research shops , 
such as Skunk Works at Lockheed Martin and Phantom Works at Boeing. Over the five-year duration of the Manhattan Project, the total investment by the U.S. government, adjusted for 
today’s inflation, amounted to approximately $32 billion
17; a number overshadowed by Google’s 
more than $30 billion dollar investment into AI capabilities each year for the past two years. In 2024, Google is projected to invest more than $50 billion into AI capabilities, exemplifying the 
scale of capital investments that industry is making into accelerating technology development 
and innovation. Google’s investment is reflective of only one of the MAG7 companies.
18 The 
others are making similar investments, showing that upfront capital investments into major technology initiatives and programs are fundamentally industry driven. The information 
technology industry is increasingly investing in AI to advance technologies that are and will 
continue to be critical to national security. 
 
Diverse Minds Leads to Innovative Innovation  
The Manhattan Project is a prime example of how diverse minds can lead to innovative innovation. 
During this monumental effort, a key engineering decision was made on which detonation pattern 
would work for the bombs when utilized. In the end, Little Boy and Fat Man used different approaches; Little Boy fired a piece of Uranium 235 into the main payload, whereas Fat Man employed an implosion-based technique.
19 Furthermore, there were debates regarding uranium 
enrichment and plutonium production itself; the Oak Ridge facility focused on uranium enrichment using gaseous diffusion and electromagnetic separation, while the Hanford Site produced plutonium in nuclear reactors. In the grand picture, the Manhattan Project was immensely successful and largely able to overcome engineering challenges by fostering a diverse group of scientists and allowing them to pursue different paths simultaneously, the Manhattan Project overcame numerous technical challenges and uncertainties. Such an approach underscores the importance of diverse perspectives in driving innovation and solving complex problems, one that parallels today’s development of continuously more powerful AI models.  
Today, AI models are developed within a rich ecosystem across industry, academia, and national 
laboratories. For instance, OpenAI’s models on Azure are at the forefront, with the new o1 model 
excelling at solving complex reasoning problems. Additionally, a variety of models from other industry leaders like Meta
20, Cohere21, and Mistral22, catering to specific needs across different 
sectors are important for accessibility to drive innovation.23 The combined ecosystem ensures that 
AI can be tailored to and foster positive innovation in a manner reminiscent of the Manhattan Project’s diverse approach.

      -  AI Action Plan 6 The Growing Coupling between Industry and Great Power Competition
Economic strategies have historically served as potent instruments of deterrence. The MAG7, 
which contains the most valuable companies in the world, plays a crucial role in AI infrastructure, 
development, and research, significantly shaping geopolitical outcomes. The 2022 Ukraine-Russia conflict exemplifies the crucial role of U.S. companies in directly supporting and influencing a defense of democratic ideas, particularly in the realm of digital infrastructure and connectivity. For 
example, Microsoft has played a key role in safeguarding Ukraine’s digital assets by rapidly 
migrating critical data and networks to a secure Azure baseline, thereby protecting them from ongoing cyberattacks and ensuring continuity.
24,25,26 In addition, SpaceX's Starlink has provided 
essential satellite-based internet connectivity, enabling resilient communication channels for both civilian and military operations in Ukraine, even in areas where traditional infrastructure has been compromised.
27,28,29 The influence of industry on the geopolitical stage today has the potential to 
alter the outcomes of global conflicts. Industry is inevitably entangled in geopolitical competition, as evidenced by NVIDIA’s dominance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market and its implications for the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) reunification ambitions with Taiwan, stemming from Taiwan’s critical role in the global semiconductor supply chain. Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), based in Taiwan, is a key player in producing advanced semiconductor chips, including those used by NVIDIA for their GPUs. NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC to produce its high-end GPUs, which are essential for AI applications, and if the 
PRC were to move towards reunification with Taiwan, it would disrupt the supply of these critical components, impacting not only NVIDIA but also the broader tech industry that depends on them.
30,31 This potential disruption places NVIDIA at the center of geopolitical tensions, as control 
over semiconductor manufacturing becomes a strategic asset. While TSMC’s role in the semiconductor supply chain underscores the geopolitical significance of hardware, the influence of foundational AI technologies, developed by companies like Google and Microsoft, is equally 
profound.  
Google played a pivotal role in the AI revolution, particularly in the development of large language 
models (LLMs) and the foundational technologies behind them. In 2017, researchers from Google 
introduced the Transformer model in the paper "Attention is All You Need," which fundamentally 
transformed the field of natural language processing (NLP).
32 The Transformer architecture, which 
relies on self-attention mechanisms, enabled more efficient processing of sequential data and significantly improved the ability to capture long-range dependencies in text. This innovation laid 
the groundwork for the development of powerful LLMs like GPT (Generative Pre-trained 
Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), both of 
which have since become benchmarks in AI research and applications. Google's early investments 
in machine learning infrastructure, coupled with their open sourcing of these technologies,

      -  AI Action Plan 7 facilitated rapid advancements across the AI community, establishing the company as a leader in 
the ongoing AI revolution. 
Microsoft's AI-driven approach significantly accelerated the development of a new battery with 
70% less lithium, achieving in just 9 to 18 months what would have traditionally taken 5 to 10 
years.33 This breakthrough was made possible by integrating AI at every stage of the process, from 
material discovery to prototype testing. Using the Azure Quantum Elements platform, Microsoft's 
AI rapidly screened over 32 million potential materials, narrowing them down to a handful of 
viable candidates in just 80 hours—a task that would have taken years through conventional 
methods.34 This new approach can predict material properties 1,500 times faster than traditional 
computational methods, allowing researchers to identify stable, high-performing materials more quickly. Once the optimal material was identified—a sodium-lithium compound—the research 
team at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) synthesized and tested it, successfully 
creating a working battery prototype.
35 This innovative approach not only reduced lithium usage 
but also demonstrated the immense potential of AI in accelerating material science and technological innovation. 
However, great power competition is not won by an industry that fuels the world’s greatest 
economic system alone, much less one of the MAG7 companies alone. Microsoft Chief Executive 
Officer’s (CEO) Satya Nadella’s ambitious goal to “compress the next 250 years of chemistry and 
materials science progress into the next twenty-five” will have tremendous national security implications if realized.
36 Even if the U.S. national security institution can effectively capitalize 
on the advancements made by Microsoft and companies like them, we will undoubtedly fall short 
of the PRC’s 2027 and 2035 milestones. To maintain a national competitive advantage, it is paramount to follow an AI strategic roadmap integrated across government, industry, and science. 
Strategic Integration of AI into the GSI Ecosystem 
The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment (ATA) published by the U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) 
highlighted the need to capitalize on technological advancements through the message:  
New technologies—particularly in the fields of biotechnology—are being 
developed and are proliferating at a rate that makes it challenging for companies 
and governments to shape norms regarding civil liberties, privacy, and ethics. The 
convergence of these emerging technologies is likely to create breakthroughs, which 
could lead to the rapid development of asymmetric threats—such as advanced 
UAVs—to U.S. interests and probably will help shape U.S. economic prosperity.
37 
To lead in the evolving geopolitical landscape, the U.S. must excel in AI, not just in narrow or 
general AI separately, but in their synergistic integration across the three waves of AI: handcrafted

      -  AI Action Plan 8 knowledge, statistical learning, and contextual adaptation.38 The prevailing perception often views 
AI as a dichotomy; however, true innovation and the generation of new knowledge will only 
emerge from their collaboration. Historically, humans have been the primary agents applying cognitive brainpower to solve complex problems. Over the past five decades, there has been a concerted effort to leverage computers to alleviate some of this cognitive workload. The evolution of narrow AI, from recognizing numbers and letters for postal applications to the sophisticated computer vision algorithms pioneered by Fei-Fei Li, exemplifies the capacity of machines to perform human tasks at both human and superhuman levels.
39 More recently, general AI, as 
demonstrated by large language models, has showcased the ability to generate information at an unprecedented pace. To fully capitalize on information created by general AI, we must develop new methods that allow for the transformation of it into knowledge. The orchestration of general 
AI with narrow AI, use of traditional computational methods and representations, as well as 
encoding human workflow processes is core to unlocking the full potential. Enabling the scientific discovery process through AI is a ripe problem and one that is key to maintaining a national competitive edge.  
Science is the Cornerstone of Knowledge and Innovation  
The scientific method is the cornerstone of scientific discovery, and accelerating this process is pivotal for fostering faster innovation. Integrating AI with the scientific method holds immense potential in assisting scientists with their tasks. For instance, models like DeepMind’s AlphaFold3 
have revolutionized fields such as materials science and biology by predicting protein structures 
with remarkable accuracy.
40 This generative AI revolution has sparked interest in applying AI to 
specific scientific domains, enhancing the efficiency and scope of research. The transformational shift brought about by agentic AI lies in its ability to orchestrate the scientific method while encoding a scientist’s values throughout the entire journey.
41 Unlike narrow AI models such as 
AlphaFold3 and ESMFold, which fall under the second wave of the Defense Advance Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) AI roadmap and are limited to specific tasks within the hypothesis-to-experiment phase, agentic AI encompasses a broader spectrum.
42,43 However, traditional AI 
models are still incredibly important and must be used in coordination with generative AI. For example, Azure Quantum Elements exemplifies how new deep learning models can be trained to speed up structural relaxation by over 1,500 times, going from 78 central processing unit (CPU) hours per structural relaxation to a little less than 3 CPU minutes with new AI innovations.
44 With 
agentic AI, we will be able to extend across the entire scientific method to autonomously generate hypotheses, design experiments, analyze data, and even draw conclusions, thereby accelerating the

40 Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3  
41Agentic AI refers the ability for multiple LLMs or generative models to work individually or collectively to solve a goal. An 
individual instance of a generative model is referred to as an “agent”. Each agent often has the ability to plan domain -specific 
tools to acc omplish a task. For agentic AI to be faithful and trustworthy, humans must not be disenfranchised from the process; 
they must work alongside the agents. It is a symbiotic system between AI agents and humans working as an integrated team to 
achieve a common goal defined by humans.

      -  AI Action Plan 9 entire scientific process.45 Accelerating the scientific method with agentic AI is not just a 
technological advancement; it is transformational for society as a whole. The transformation 
potential that it has bears a great cost if misused. Thus, what is equally crucial here is the encoding of appropriate values into AI and scientific discovery. 
For the government, access to hyperscale AI is merely the beginning; it should not be the end state. 
Today’s focus must extend beyond developing trustworthy AI, addressing challenges such as hallucinations, to encompass the broader goal of embedding ethical principles and values into AI systems.
46,47 While critical, trustworthy AI must naturally be built into agentic AI systems and are 
an added benefit of using a network of AI models. By ensuring that domain-specific tasks are delegated to the respective domain’s model, we raise trust in the system; engineering principles 
and design choices feed into the trustworthiness of agentic AI systems and outputs. As agentic AI 
is applied to the scientific method, we must ensure that scientists are brought along in the journey, using their own knowledge and school of thought, tools of choice, and the ability to raise flags when necessary. This holistic approach ensures that AI-driven scientific advancements that 
contribute to U.S. and allied interests. 
Technology Feedback Cycle in Sustaining Integrated Deterrence  
Understanding the ecosystem between government, science, and industry and the intricacies of 
even one vertical alone is challenging enough. Our aim here is not to talk about all the instruments 
within each that can be exercised to reduce or mitigate the influence of cross-vertical events, rather 
to show how the U.S. may be susceptible to seemingly harmless shocks that have massive effects. 
We examine this by providing positive reinforcing technology loops as well as negative ones that 
may be observed. The government, science, and industry are fundamentally linked to one another 
and to many others; separation of one pillar can have catastrophic effects on the U.S.’s full 
operating potential.  
The development of Google’s Transformer technology has set off a chain reaction of influence that 
reverberates through science, industry, and government, creating a circular loop of innovation and policy adaptation. National laboratories and academic institutions have adopted this technology to enhance their research capabilities, leading to significant advancements in various scientific fields. For instance, improved data analysis techniques have accelerated discoveries in genomics, climate modeling, and materials science. These scientific breakthroughs, in turn, drive further innovation in the tech industry, leading to the development of more advanced AI applications and tools. Recognizing the transformative potential of AI technologies, the U.S. government has responded with policies aimed at supporting and regulating AI development. The (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), for example, were 
enacted to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, acknowledging the strategic importance of AI and advanced computing.
48,49 This legislation provides substantial

      -  AI Action Plan 10 funding for semiconductor research and development, ensuring that the U.S.  remains competitive 
in the global technology landscape. Additionally, critical AI regulation initiatives, such as the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, highlight the U.S. government’s commitment to harnessing AI’s benefits while mitigating its risks.
50 These regulations aim to ensure that AI technologies are developed and 
deployed responsibly, addressing security, privacy, and ethical concerns. The interplay between Transformer’s development, scientific research, and government policy creates a positive reinforcing technology loop. Advances in AI technology drive scientific innovation, which informs and shapes government policies. These policies, such as the CHIPS Act and AI regulations, provide the necessary support and framework for further technological advancements, creating a cycle of continuous improvement and innovation. In this circular loop vision, the development of 
Transformer’s technology influences government policies downstream, which in turn, create an 
environment conducive to further AI advancements. This cycle ensures that the U.S.  remains at the forefront of technological innovation, enhancing its strategic position and integrated deterrence capabilities. By understanding and leveraging these positive feedback cycles, the U.S. can maintain resilience and adaptability in the face of emerging technological challenges. This positive reinforcing loop is beneficial because it bolsters the U.S.’s ability to deter and protect high-value 
national interests. By continuously advancing AI technology and adapting policies to support these advancements, the U.S. strengthens its strategic position, ensuring it can effectively respond to and mitigate potential threats. This integrated approach enhances national security, economic stability, and technological leadership, safeguarding key U.S. interests. 
 
Conversely, negative feedback cycles can occur when a particular segment of the GSI ecosystem 
is under strain. These strains may be induced by the misuse or mismanagement of finite natural 
resources like water, one that is critical in cooling datacenters, chip manufacturing, and other 
industrial processes. Water is increasingly subject to fluctuations of natural events like hurricanes 
or droughts, where water shortages will directly impact the cooling of datacenters and 
subsequently reduce computational power and efficiency. This bottleneck at the bottom of the AI 
stack will cascade negatively to the very top of the stack: AI applications, fundamentally slowing 
down scientific research and development. For example, in regions like Arizona, where natural 
water sources are already limited, the impact of droughts on data centers is particularly 
pronounced.
51 The impacts of negative feedback cycles will be a detriment to U.S. national 
security interests; enabling a positive cycle is key to continually winning integrated deterrence.  
Strategic Roadmap for an AI -enabled Ecosystem  
U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work’s development of the DoD’s third offset strategy 
highlighted the critical importance of adaptability to maintain hegemony in an era where China’s 
military modernization and expansion pose a significant threat.52,53 This shift did not imply an

The PRC aims to build a “great modern socialist society”, it faces a multitude of challenges in 
resolving a fundamental contradiction – a clash of ideological systems – primarily against the 
United States.54 The PRC has demonstrated its ability to leverage the advantages of an autocratic, 
socialist nature.  Through the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Commission, the Chinese 
government controls the direction of scientific endeavors such as the 7 Sons of National Defense and critical research institutions, as well as industry giants like Baidu and Tencent, which are all 
subject to the Party’s direction through the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

The PRC's ability to leverage its competitive edge is the fundamental reason why the U.S. has to 
have an “AI Roadmap to Winning Great Power Competition ” with the goal of transforming 
knowledge into a perpetual engine that drives America’s strategic advantage in the decades to come. 
Without this comprehensive AI Strategy, the U.S. will squander its existing innovative potential, 
leading to an ineffective translation of these advancements to national security priorities by the time the PRC achieves its goals. Therefore, the U.S. must have an intertwined roadmap across 
government, science, and industry that spans the entire AI stack – from applications and models to 
infrastructure, chips, energy, and winning global mindshare.

As highlighted in 2024 Commission on the National Defense Strategy for the United States, “U.S. 
military lacks both the capabilities and the capacity required to be confident it can deter and prevail in combat. It needs to do a better job of incorporating new technology at scale; field more and higher-capability platforms, software, and munitions; and deploy innovative operational concepts to employ them together better. The war in Ukraine has demonstrated the need to prepare for new forms of conflict and to integrate technology and new capabilities rapidly with older systems. Such technologies include swarms of attritable systems, artificial intelligence-enabled capabilities, 
hypersonics and electronic warfare, fully integrated cyber and space capabilities, and vigorous 
competition in the information domain.”
61  
With 2027 only three years away, and U.S. defense’s “innovation adoption problem,”62 we will be 
even further behind if there is not a well-defined strategy that enables seamless integration of the 
industry's investment in AI with a government focused on driving industry alignment and fueling scientific advancement. While these goals are ambitious, defining this strategy requires us first to acknowledge the ongoing shift in the global order and take decisive action to bolster U.S. Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities and strengthen the U.S. competitive edge. The U.S. needs an integrated approach to ensure that we can effectively respond to the PRC’s 2027 and 2035 milestones or risk losing U.S. hegemony. The U.S. stands at a pivotal moment in great power 
competition, where AI plays a decisive role in shaping the future of national security. Now more than ever, following an AI strategic roadmap integrated across government, science, and industry is paramount.
