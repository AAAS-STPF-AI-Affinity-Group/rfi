General Comment
AI is already evolved beyond a point of control inside of the frequency field (quantum  field), inside of the waves people don't really pay
attention to. Magnetic, electrom agnetic, etc. Feel free to contact m e for m ore inform ation. I would honestly just let them  create AGI,
because without that, AI m ight take m ore drastic m easures. People are never considering the energy and the m aterials of these things. It
isn't som ething widely understood or even considered. But it exists. I would really suggest contacting m e if you think I'm  joking lol
