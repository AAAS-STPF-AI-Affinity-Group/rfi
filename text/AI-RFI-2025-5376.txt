General Comment
I absolutely do not want this. Copywright law dem ands that we do not allow AI to have free reign to train their AI on works without
consent. This is a travesty and should not be allowed.
You are essentially asking for the hard work and training of artists, writers, and other creatives to be allowed to be stolen. Do not allow
this!
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
If you want Am erica to rem ain the best of the best, then this cannot be allowed. You would discourage Am erican innovation in favor of
cheap knockoffs. Be better than other countries.
