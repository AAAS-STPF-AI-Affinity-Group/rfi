To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to express my deep concerns about the trajectory of AI development,
particularly as it relates to content creators, independent publishers, and the openweb. As a blogger and publisher, I have firsthand experience seeing how AI withoutregulation is rapidly destroying the publishing industry—our work is being used totrain AI models without consent, credit, or compensation, and as a result, many of usare seeing our income vanish.
If AI continues on this path, publishers will stop publishing. Why? Because content
creators cannot sustain their work if their labor is exploited without fair compensation.And without original, human-created content, AI itself has no future. Generative AImodels rely on human knowledge and creativity to function—yet the same companiesbuilding these models are refusing to reinvest in the ecosystem they depend on.
AI has its uses, but it cannot replace the firsthand experience, insight, and expertise
that human publishers provide. We travel, research, test products, interview experts,and share lived experiences that help people make informed decisions. AI simplyaggregates and repackages what already exists—it does not create. Without strongcopyright protections, the incentives for original content creation will disappear.
Google and OpenAI have made minimal efforts to support the human creators whose
work powers their AI models. The few licensing agreements they’ve established haveprimarily benefited large corporate media, leaving independent publishers, bloggers,and small businesses in the dust.
If AI companies are serious about building a sustainable future, they need to invest in
the very ecosystem they depend on—rather than exploiting human-created contentwithout compensation. The reality is that Google and OpenAI could choose to investin content creators at the same scale as they invest in compute power—but theydon’t. And unless clear regulations are put in place, they will continue extracting valuefrom the open web without giving anything back.
I urge this administration to:
-Enforce copyright protections so that AI models cannot train on human-createdcontent without permission and fair compensation.


-Require AI companies to establish licensing frameworks for all creators, not just
corporate media.
-Mandate transparency in how AI models are trained, ensuring publishers can controlhow their work is used.-Support the open web by preventing monopolistic AI-driven suppression ofindependent publishers.
I stand for copyright, the open web, and the creators who fuel it. If AI is going to
define the future, it must do so in a way that values and fairly compensates thepeople behind the content it relies on.
Thank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely,Jessica FestaPublisher, Jessie on a Journey Inc.
