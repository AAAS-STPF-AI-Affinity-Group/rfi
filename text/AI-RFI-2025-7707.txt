General Comment
This is a ridiculous notion that will weaken copyright protections of created m aterials and allow OpenAI and other AI com panies to steal
content to create their bots that destroy the environm ent and produce garbage inform ation. This is detrim ental to the US creative econom y
and should not be considered.
