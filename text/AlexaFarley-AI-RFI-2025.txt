I am writing to express a stance firmly against the AI Action Plan outlined on Document
Number 2025-02305.  
As an artist and a writer, artificial intelligence does nothing to benefit me, and has been used
to directly profit off of my work and the work of my peers with no compensation or evenrecognition for the labor we put in. The technology is also nothing but overhypedsmokescreens, incapable of producing work that has any real value to our society. Its onlyutility is in generating empty slop and giving additional profit to the wealthy. It erodes thecritical thinking of our population, it fills the internet with meaningless junk, and it wastesmassive amounts of precious energy resources in doing so.
Please, please do not remove the only protection hard-working creators have against our
livelihoods being taken away. 
Thank you,
Alexa Farley
