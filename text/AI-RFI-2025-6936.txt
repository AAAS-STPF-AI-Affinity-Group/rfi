General Comment
Allowing AI to run unregulated not only has consequences on creatives, but also general identity on the internet. How will this fly
internationally, where som e places like the EU are already putting anti-AI m easures in place? It will only isolate us further and, in case of a
cyber em ergency, no one will help us. What kind of spineless politician would let this pass? There will just be m ore generated content
falsifying people online, and who knows if this will m ake politicians look bad. AI is already getting fairly close to real life, but not quite. I
hope y'all can live with som ething horrendous being pinned on you...oh wait, you already are. Wait until people m ake photos of you, it's
worse than text.
