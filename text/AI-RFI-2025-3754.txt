General Comment
I am  a veteran, parent, teacher, author, and artist. Do not allow OpenAI to use copyrights m aterial to train their AI, it is theft for which a
citizen would be held accountable. AI does not have m ore right than a citizen to steal from  the work of other hum an beings. I don't think
AI has a place in the future of the U.S, I believe it is a m ajor threat. It steals jobs, it steals livelihoods, it consum es unconscionable
quantities of energy, and if the Governm ent im plem ents it to control very sensitive sectors, the security of our nation is at extrem e risk.
Open AI should be shut down or banned from  Governm ent affairs. Again, it steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans, threatens our national
security, and Profits off theft. You cannot possibly support that. I certainly do not.
