General Comment
Generative Ai/Ai is nothing but a form  of theft. It is soulless. It is hollow. It is unwanted. It is vile. It steals from  hardworking, talented
artists across countless m edium s. From  paint and illustration, to m usic, to voice acting, to anim ation, and m otion pictures. 
The ultim ate goal of this endeavor is to control the creative arts without having to pay the hum ans, who create the very works that
Generative Ai SCRAPES, and STEALS. 
This is an effort to produce a "get rich, quick" schem e, and com pletely circum vent copyright law, that will only benefit the very technology
com panies/upstarts that have been responsible for sim ilar, garbage technologies, like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, etc. All of which have been
found to be nothing m ore than Ponzi schem es, and rug pulls, that hurt gullible people, m aking them  believe that "we too, can becom e rich,
overnight". 
Do not allow Ai to have free rein over the works of hum an beings.
