General Comment
In order for the United States to stay a place of equal opportunity it needs to honor the right people have to the fruits of their own labor.
Retaining copyright is im perative for allowing Am ericans to dictate how the things they create are bought, sold, or used. Rem oving that
right and handing it to a corporation, for profit or otherwise, is displacing that labor and abusing it, passing on the benefits and profit off to
another without com pensating the original contributor.
AI is a useful technology but it should not succeed at the cost of the Am erican people, creating m ajor financial harm  to the contributors it
collects from  without perm ission or com pensation. If technology cannot survive without infringing on the rights of others, or was built to
survive on violating those rights, it should not exist.
