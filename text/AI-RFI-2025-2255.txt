General Comment
This action would allow AI com panyâ€™s to use inform ation/assets they do not own nor have the rights to use in order to train their for-profit
AI system s. AI system s have always been proven to be in direct com petition with existing non-AI businesses and em ployees. To allow AI
access to inform ation they do not own (which m any AI com panies are already using), would be an unfair advantage, as well as an erosion
of Am erican law and rights. The context of the business should not allow for carve outs. Copyrights would be broken. Privacy would be
broken. The ends do not justify the m eans.
