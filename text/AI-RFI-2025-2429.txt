General Comment
Com puters glitch and crash. Doing this is idiotic. But of course there's a Nazi in charge of everything, and I don't m ean Trum p, so of
course you don't care as you ruin the lives of literally everyone. AI will destroy every creative industry by stealing content they created. It
will destroy other industries by attem pting and failing to replace jobs intended by people. This will bring yet m ore ruin to this once great
country
