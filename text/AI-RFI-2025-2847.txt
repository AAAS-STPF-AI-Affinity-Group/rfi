General Comment
I am  writing to express m y deep concern about the rapid advancem ents in artificial intelligence and the existential risks they pose to
hum anity. While AI has the potential to bring great benefits, it also presents unprecedented dangers that dem and urgent political attention.
Experts in AI safety, including those from  OpenAI, DeepMind, and leading universities, have warned that m isaligned AI system s could
surpass hum an intelligence and becom e uncontrollable. Scenarios such as AI-driven econom ic disruption, autonom ous weapons
escalation, and loss of hum an oversight in critical system s are no longer speculative—they are real risks that could destabilize our societies.
Moreover, a poorly regulated AI race between nations and corporations could push safety considerations aside, leading to catastrophic
consequences. We need proactive governance, international cooperation, and strict regulatory fram eworks to ensure AI rem ains aligned
with hum an values. The choices we m ake today will determ ine whether AI becom es hum anity’s greatest ally or its gravest threat.
I appreciate your attention to this urgent m atter.
Best regards,
