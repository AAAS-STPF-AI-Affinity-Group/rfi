General Comment
Giving AI com panies the ability to effectively pirate whatever m edia they want, from  anyone, is a terrible idea. They already scrape
citizen's intellectual property without perm ission and then use it to train m odels and m ade m oney off of said m odels, which in m y opinion
should be illegal, as this is clearly not fair use. 
If piracy is illegal and m ajor com panies work so hard to fight it, then why should it be illegal for individual citizens to pirate, but big AI
"tech-bro" com panies can without any repercussions? 
Plus, the era of free and open-source m odels is already here. Am erica's big com panies have clearly lost, why do we need to give them
even m ore power to destroy out country and waste electricity? When I can run a m odel at hom e on m y RTX 3080, it's clear where the
answer lies. 
As an artist m yself, I find the idea that any com pany could just use m y data without any kind of com pensation for m yself horrifying and
disgusting. It should be opt-in only in m y opinion, and regardless, if an artist's work is used for training, they should be financially
com pensated appropriately. 
This proposal to give Am erica's 1% free reign over all our works regardless of copyright laws is clearly open for ram pant abuse. Please, I
beg you to reject this and uphold copyright law as intended.
