General Comment
I am  an artist. This is literally going to steal m y livelihood away from  m e. Not only that but it is blatant copyright infringem ent that steals
from  an artist hard labor. It has no place in our society, and honestly? How can you proclaim  we have the greatest innovators, artists,
m usicians, m inds, if you keep feeding everyone through a m achine. Where is your sense of pride in creation? Where is the joy in taking
som ething from  scratch and crafting it with your bare hands? We used to boast about our illustrators, our designers and thinkers. This is a
get rich quick schem e that will ultim ately fail, and anyone supporting ai will com e out looking like court jester fools (it also looks like utter
garbage, I m ean seriously, apparently you all need your eyes checked, m aybe som e arts education while you're at it). Not every piece of
art is m eant to m ake m oney, but rather to feed the soul. Pick up a pencil, gather som e paper, and see for yourself.
