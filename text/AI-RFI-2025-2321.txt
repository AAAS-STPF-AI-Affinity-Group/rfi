General Comment
REQUIRE DATA SETS FOR BUILDING ANY LLM OR FUTURE ARTIFICIAL MODELS TO USE DATASETS NOT
INFRINGING ANY COPYRIGHT LAW, PUBLICLY CREATED WORKS OR ANY DATA THAT HAS NOT
CONSENSUALLY AGREED TO BEING USE IN CONSTRUCTION OF THESE MODELS.
MAKE IT A WILLING AGREEMENT, NOT SOMETHING JUST THROWN IN A TERMS OF SERVICE
IN SIMPLE TERMS, MAKE THESE COMPANYS BUILD THEIR DATASET USING THEIR OWN MEANS.
NO MORE SCRAPING OF THE INTERNET. TAKE A PHOTO OF DOGS IF YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY ONE, NOT
SOMEONE ELSES
THE SAME WAY WE MAKE SCIENCE EFFICIENT BY STRANGLING COST, WE SHOULD HOLD A STANDARD OF
THESE MODELS USING LESS TO PRODUCE MORE.
ENERGY REQUIRED VS ACCURACY BEING AN EXAMPLE. WHY USE A POWER PLANTS WORTH OF POWER JUST
TO CREATE A DOG. COMEON
ACTUALLY INVITE OUTSIDE (FOREIGN) COMPANIES TO WORK ON THIS FOR SOME COMMON PURPOSE OTHER
THAN TO SAY WE HAVE THE BEST ONE. PLEASE. IM SO TIRED OF EGO WARS THIS DECADE ;u;
WE CAN CREATE SOMETHING BETTER IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER. LOOK AT THE ISS
PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS OF ARTIFICIALLY GENERATED CONTENT.
MAKE IT CLEAR WHEN AI IS IN USE TO THE CONSUMER. THIS GOES FOR PHONE CALLS, IMAGES FOUND
ONLINE, VIDEOS CREATED, ADVERTISEMENT, FINAL PRODUCTS ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING USING AI
SHOULD JUST ADMIT IT.
TRANSPARENCY SHOULD BE THE MAIN FOCUS WHEN GENERATED CONTENT EXIST IN THE WORLD.
GRANDMA CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
DON'T SPEND 500 BILLION DOLLARS YOU MORONS.
