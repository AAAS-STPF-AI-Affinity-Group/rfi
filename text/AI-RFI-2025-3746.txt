General Comment
I am  com pletely against this. Allowing any com pany (including AI use) to consum e copyrighted work without the perm ission of the
copyright holders is tram pling their rights. We've already seen clear exam ples of this when AI im age generation puts a "GETTY IMAGES"
in the generated work. This should not be allowed and wipes out the value of the copyright holder's work.
