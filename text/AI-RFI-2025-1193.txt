General Comment
My Nam e is Luke Maddalena and I am  a second-sem ester senior at Avonwroth High School. I studied generative AI and its im pact on
the wrestling com m unity in a course on AI and ethics this year. From  m y research, I think the current adm inistration's viewpoint on AI
regulation is beneficial to society. The innovation of AI will support what needs support and leave alone com m unities that won’t benefit
from  AI filling in such as the wrestling com m unity. Com m unities built on physical growth and hum an interaction will not need the progress
of generative AI however AI’s progression will not disturb the future of the wrestling com m unity. I believe that we can live in a world
where hum ans thrive from  the utilization of AI while keeping tradition, culture, and values relevant in the social and econom ic world.
Holding back AI’s progress in the hope of preserving hum an control over the world will only hurt us in the long run. AI is com pletely
situational and in situations where it is not as appropriate like the wrestling com m unity, it can rem ain in the backseat. This adm inistration's
viewpoint, and m y research in the course, says that AI will be a tool and progress in the future, but not replace hum ans.
