General Comment
Allowing com panies to freely use citizens data the public did not consent to give is an enorm ously large breach of privacy and copyright
law. We have the right to be the sole proprietor to our ideas whether they be in written, visual, or audio form ats. Granting perm ission to
these com panies scraping data would severely hinder the Am erican sm all business to flourish. How would new ideas be presented to the
m arket if the AI of these larger corporations scrapped the idea from  an internet forum  or even private Word docum ents? They would
elim inate com petition. My nam e is Natalie and I do not believe com panies and corporations should be allowed to train their AI program s
on m y writing, artwork, photography, or any other content produced by m e.
