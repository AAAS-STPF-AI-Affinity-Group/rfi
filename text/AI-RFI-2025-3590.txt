General Comment
As an author, artist, and scholar, I object in the strongest possible term s to the unauthorized use of *anyone's* work for the purpose of
training or otherwise providing content for so-called "AI." The m ulti-billion dollar com panies do not need the protection of the federal
governm ent to properly license creative works in order to distribute products, nor do they deserve m ore leeway for unauthorized usage of
copyrighted works than your average Am erican. 
***This docum ent is approved for public dissem ination. The docum ent contains no business-proprietary or confidential inform ation.
Docum ent contents m ay be reused by the governm ent in developing the AI Action Plan and associated docum ents without attribution.***
