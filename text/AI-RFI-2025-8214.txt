General Comment
Artificial intelligence com pany heads have said repeatedly that their business cannot function if they're not allowed free and unrestricted
use of copyrighted and otherwise protected works.
To that I say: if they can't function without stealing other peoples' work, then they don't deserve to function at all.
Copyright protections are vital and cannot be discarded just because an AI com pany's CEO says "but we need it." They need to work
within the law to license works properly or create their own if they want to use it for training, and cannot be given an exception that allows
them  free access to works that they have no right to. That's sim ply un-Am erican.
And as these CEOs continue to dem and free access to copyrighted works, their AI continues to rem ain unreliable and inconsistent.
Generative AI is still prone to m ajor errors and hallucinations, as it m erely repeats what it im agines the next word in a sentence is, without
any fact checking or verification. Artificial intelligence is far from  intelligent, and giving AI com panies free reign to steal works from  other
people isn't going to m ake them  any m ore accurate.
Any business that relies on theft to succeed has no right to success.
