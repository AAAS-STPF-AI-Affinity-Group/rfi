General Comment
By im plem enting the legal use of AI, we deny m illions of people around our nation the ability to work. Allowing this to step further will
harm  our nation irrevocably, both m orally and physically. The use of generative AI has already been shown to be a hazard to our health
and rapidly decreasing the am ount of tim e between life and heat stroke of the known world. From  a legal standpoint, all training m aterial
given to AI m odels to learn would be a breach of copyright, therefore garnering all m odels to be copyright infringem ent. Your people do
not want this. You will not gain m oney from  this. Stop.
