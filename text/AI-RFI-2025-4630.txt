General Comment
It is absurd that big tech is getting away with the sheer am ount of copyright infringem ent and digital piracy they are doing to "train" their AI
m odels. OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Stability AI, and others have adm itted to illegally scraping servers and torrenting copyrighted works.
They say that they "need" to do this while individual Am erican citizens have been fined or even jailed for less.
AI is another gear in the Big Tech Censorship m achine. They need to reigned in, and m ade sure that AI is NOT used in ANY executive
m anner.
