General Comment
I'm  so em barrassed for m y country. AI does not hold a place in the future of the United States. It steals from  m y and m y friend's livelihood
- plus it profits from  the theft of our work. It is wild that som ething so overhyped, such a clear scam  to churn up m oney and keep the
gam e going is getting so m uch official support to fleece the eyes of the Am erican public.
