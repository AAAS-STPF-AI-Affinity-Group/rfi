RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE (AI) ACTION PLAN  
 
AI is transforming education, creating new opportunities to improve teaching and learning. 
However, AI integration requires a thoughtful approach that balances innovation with equity, 
transparency and accountability. By using AI responsibly, we can empower educators, 
personalize student learning, and ensure technology helps close, not widen, educational gaps. 
Achieving this vision will require sustained collaboration among students, parents, educators, 
policymakers, researchers, and developers. It will also require thoughtful design practices, 
robust testing, and reflection on the social and ethical implications of AI systems to ensure tools 
respond to students' strengths, needs, and cultural contexts. The following recommendations 
identify key actions to ensure AI supports safe, effective, and equitable learning environments. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AI IN EDUCATION 
1. Research & Development: Driving AI Innovation for Learning 
AI R&D must prioritize transformative, scalable, and accelerated educational innovations. 
● Expand Public-Private AI Research Collaborations  to ensure AI-driven solutions address 
unmet student learning needs while reinforcing, not replacing, educators' roles. 
● Establish AI Testbeds in Education  to evaluate real-world applications of AI in learning, 
balancing rapid advancements with clear, evidence-based student impact. 
● Advance AI for Adaptive Learning and Workforce Readiness by supporting research in 
competency-based models, AI-assisted skills training, and scalable AI adoption pathways. 
● Incorporate Equity Audits in R&D Processes  to evaluate AI models for bias, ensuring 
systems are trained on representative data and tested for fairness across demographic 
groups. 
2. K-12 (Primary and Secondary)  AI Engagement: Empowering Schools, Educators, & Parents 
K-12 leaders need clear guidance and practical resources to integrate AI responsibly and protect 
students. 
● Develop Research-based AI Implementation Guidelines  to help school leaders assess 
and deploy AI responsibly, ensuring rapid adoption does not outpace demonstrated 
effectiveness. 
● Strengthen AI Professional Development to equip teachers with the skills to integrate AI 
while retaining instructional oversight. 
 


● Ensure AI Tools Align with Curricular Goals to support teacher-student interactions and 
reinforce high-quality instructional models. 
● Promote Teacher-in-the-Loop Models that prioritize teacher agency in AI 
decision-making and prevent over-reliance on automated systems. 
● Provide Schools with Tools to Evaluate Bias in AI Systems  by developing practical 
resources that help educators identify discriminatory outcomes in AI-driven platforms. 
3. Postsecondary (Tertiary) AI Engagement: Preparing a Future-Ready Workforce 
Postsecondary institutions play a vital role in advancing AI innovation and preparing students for 
emerging careers. 
● Strengthen Professional Development for faculty and staff to support AI integration in 
instruction, assessment, and student supports. 
● Rigorously Test and Evaluate AI tools to ensure alignment with educational goals and 
student needs. 
● Expand AI Workforce Pipelines  through industry partnerships that provide hands-on AI 
training and align with evolving job market demands. 
● Create Regional AI Learning Ecosystems  that foster collaboration across colleges, 
universities, and industry to prepare students for AI-driven career pathways. 
● Encourage Postsecondary Institutions to Adopt Practices that Identify and Mitigate 
Bias in AI-enhanced admissions, assessment, and student support systems. 
4. AI Literacy: Building Foundational Understanding 
Equipping educators, students, and families with AI literacy skills is critical for informed 
engagement and responsible decision-making. 
● Provide Targeted AI Training for Educators to ensure they can evaluate and apply 
AI-driven tools effectively. 
● Promote AI literacy as a Core Element of Workforce Readiness  by identifying and 
promoting STEM and non-STEM apprenticeships, technical certifications, and vocational 
programs to encourage digital readiness, innovation, and economic growth. 
● Empower Families and Communities by establishing school-community partnerships 
and hands-on learning programs to ensure family engagement and community-driven 
solutions that strengthen the local understanding of AI literacy. ● Advance Equity-Centered AI Literacy Programs by designing materials accessible to 
marginalized groups, students with disabilities, and multilingual learners.

● Provide Guidance on Algorithmic Bias for Educators and Families  to support informed 
engagement with AI systems and empower stakeholders to identify and challenge 
potentially discriminatory outcomes. 
5. Industry Engagement: Ensuring AI Tools Support Education 
Developers play a pivotal role in ensuring AI systems are safe, effective, and designed to 
improve learning outcomes before they are adopted in educational settings across all levels. 
● Establish AI Standards for Education Technology  to ensure transparency in AI 
functionality, data collection, and decision-making. 
● Encourage Investment in AI Safety & Effectiveness by advocating for evidence-based 
standards that maintain educational integrity. 
● Develop AI Vendor Certification Programs to ensure AI tools meet safety, privacy, and 
efficacy standards before school deployment. 
● Promote AI Co-Design Models  that encourage developers to actively engage educators, 
students, and parents during the design and testing phases to improve usability and 
relevance. 
● Encourage Developers to Engage Diverse Stakeholders in Design Phases to ensure AI 
systems reflect a broad range of cultural, linguistic, and educational needs. 
6. International Collaboration: Advancing Innovation and Equity in AI for Education 
Global partnerships are essential to ensuring AI advances innovation, equity, and economic 
opportunity. By engaging in multilateral forums, the U.S. can shape global AI policies, expand 
opportunities for U.S. industry, and support educational equity worldwide. 
● Develop Collaborative AI Learning Networks that connect education leaders across 
economies to exchange strategies for AI integration, address shared challenges, and 
adapt solutions to diverse educational contexts. ● Create Joint AI Governance Frameworks with international partners to promote 
transparency, mitigate bias, and ensure AI systems are inclusive, accessible, and aligned 
with democratic values. ● Support Cross-Border AI Workforce Readiness Initiatives by aligning AI literacy 
frameworks, sharing career development strategies, and ensuring students are prepared 
for global job markets in AI-driven industries. 
CONCLUSION  
AI’s role in education is not just about innovation — it’s about shaping the future of learning in 
ways that expand opportunity and uphold core educational values. By approaching AI with 
3 


intention, we can unlock its potential to drive equity, empower educators, and prepare students 
to thrive in an increasingly complex world. The true measure of success will be our ability to 
develop and apply AI in ways that reflect our highest aspirations for education — fostering 
curiosity, creativity, and human connection while safeguarding the rights and well-being of 
every learner.
