General Comment
Do not allow AI com panies to train on data that they do not access ethically. AI developm ent com panies stand on the precipice of a
significant overreach of privacy and personal property. They endeavor to take the wealth of hum an-m ade knowledge and produce
derivative technology for personal profit. There's no prom ise of the actual efficacy or benefit to m ankind from  the production of this
technology, only a prom ise that they can continue to m aintain som e relevance in the m arket for their shareholders. 
OpenAI and other AI research com panies that want access to m ore data are prom ising to turn our art, our science, our m edical records,
our private inform ation into fuel for their bottom  line. It's not just theft, its greedy inform ation laundering, no other industry is allowed so
m uch lenience with intellectual property. The sparse potential benefits don't outweigh the privacy concerns from  corporate entities already
which have a history of wanton breaking things then asking forgiveness. Put a stop to their abuse.
