General Comment
The sim ple fact of the m atter is that AI is a dead end industry, with about as m uch life left in it as the NFTs that cam e before it. Despite the
resources poured into it--billions of dollars, vast quantities of stolen IP and natural hum an conversation--the technology hasn't m eaningfully
im proved since its public debut and rem ains so consistently bad at the tasks it's put to that, if it were hum an, it would've been fired and
blacklisted from  m ultiple industries ages ago. Its sole purported value is in reducing or rem oving hum an labor at m ultiple points, yet
between its frequent errors and its constant dem and for new hum an-generated m edia to train on it actually increases the tim e and cost of
production for a lower quality result.
This isn't even getting into the m atter of gutting the Am erican creative industries that have kept our culture globally dom inant for so m any
decades, but other com m enters will have that angle m ore than covered.
If you want Am erica to rem ain relevant in the com ing century, you cannot em brace AI. Get ahead of the curve. Reject it now.
