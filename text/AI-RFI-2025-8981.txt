General Comment
Nothing can ever be fair use if its creation is dependent on the theft of countless pieces of personal and copyrighted m aterial. Under no
circum stances should AI system s be allowed to subsist off of the hard work of others without perm ission, com pensation, or transparency.
The hard work of m e and m y peers cannot be underm ined sim ply because of the greed of a com pany that wants to take everything it
com es across for itself with wanton abandon.
