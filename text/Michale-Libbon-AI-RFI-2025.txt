Michale Libbon, 
My name is M ichael Libbon and I am a 2nd semester senior at Avonworth High School. I 
studied Ge nerative AI and its impact on the banking community for two months in a course 
on AI and Ethics this year. From my research, I think this current administration' s Viewpoint 
on AI regulation is to progressively build on banking technology with the use of artiﬁcial 
intelligence. Establishing the use of artiﬁcial intelligence within this community allows 
corporations to safely move money quicker than ever before. G enerally, the transaction 
process for banks are slow. Incorporating AI allows systems to run smoother at it reads and surveys transactions quicker. Banks use this technology as a tool within the crime department as well. They can use generative AI to detec t fraudulent activity within a blink of 
an eye, which allows customers to feel safe and secure when using their money. Generative AI for banking industries is largely used as a tool now in the year 2025 and corporations are spending billions upon trillions of dollars on this generational technology.
