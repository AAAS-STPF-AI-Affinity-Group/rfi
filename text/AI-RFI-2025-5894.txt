General Comment
As a creator of published works, self-publisher, and longtim e editor for publications, I well appreciate and understand the centuries-long
tradition of copyright. Our m odern copyright is the result of a long evolution, being tweaked and altered to balance the m any intersecting
and som etim es opposing interests of creators, publishers, consum ers, and the m any industries that operate som ewhat invisibly around
every single published work.
The proposed changes regarding copyright and so-called artificial intelligence represent anarchic chaos. They threaten to dem olish untold
value, both m onetary and non-m onetary, elim inating revenues, jobs, and quality products for the public. These changes advantage a tiny
circle of investors, and harm  a m uch larger m ass of investors, workers, writers, m anagers, readers, learners, and, ultim ately, even those
who think that they are achieving good with their anti-copyright stance.
