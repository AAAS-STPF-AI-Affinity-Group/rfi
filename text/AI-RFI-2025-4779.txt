General Comment
I do not believe generative AI holds a place in the future of the US. Generative AI m odels steal from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and
profits off of theft of works that were not licensed specifically for use in generative AI m odels. Generative AI is a trend and a scam
capitalizing on novelty in its current state and produces little benefit or worth to the public.
