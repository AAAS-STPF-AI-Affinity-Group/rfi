Hello,
It is my strongly held belief that this plan is unnecessary and overtly invasive on the personal
rights and well being of every American citizen. I encourage this plan to be stopped andcompletely scrapped. I believe restrictions should be placed upon the development of artificialintelligence, in order to ensure that the privacy of every american citizen is respected.restrictions should include bans on the collection and use of data not gathered with the explicitand enthusiastic consent of the party the data is being collected from. This document isapproved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-proprietary orconfidential information. Document contents may be reused by the government in developingthe AI Action Plan and associated documents without attribution. 
Sincerely,
Daniel Jacobs
