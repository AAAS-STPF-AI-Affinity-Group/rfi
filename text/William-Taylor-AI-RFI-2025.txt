We do NOT need special regulations about AI.   We already have more than enough
regulations about what people or businesses may or may not do.   If a payroll program
messes up a payment, the business that operated the payroll  program is liable.   A court
held an airline responsible  for honoring a special fare offered by their AI program - the
court ruled that the airline would have been liable if a human had offered the discount,
so they were liable for what the AI offered.
What more  do we need?
There is concern for deepfakes, but that has nothing to do with AI - if they should be
illegal, they should be illegal regardless of how they're made.   The same goes for putting
people's faces on porn videos.   
AI just makes it easier, it doesn't create a new crime.
