General Comment
OpenAI should not be able to legally steal from  others. This is entirely against copyright laws and defeats the purpose of those laws. Any
AI program  or function that steals from  hardworking artists and com m unities should be sued or brought punishm ent with their actions.
THIS IS NOT OKAY!
