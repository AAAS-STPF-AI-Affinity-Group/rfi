General Comment
"Artificial Intelligence" is, as it currently exists, is an a lgorithm that dec ides what follows something based on what it was tra ined on. What 
it was tra ined on is almost universally something that was chosen without the creator's c hoice and intent. It is impossible to create  
something like this of a ny reaso nable size without blatant theft and cop yright infringement.
Even if you ignore the massive energy and reso urce req uirements, the fact that it rare ly makes a nything of a ny actual value, and that it is an 
industry run by sca mmers, just the fact that it's a t heft engine is enough to make this an ob vious sign that this needs to be dropped  
immediately.
Pretty much every industry that was scam med into bu ying the bridge on th is is walking back on it because it's simply not worth the 
energy  or money. I'm beg ging you to catch up. It's a f&^% scam, get a grip.
