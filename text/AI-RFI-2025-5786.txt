General Comment
AI is stealing and is therefore unconstitutional. Allowing this to go through is not only infringing copyrights and tradem arks but will also
m ost likely put hard working creative people, who have the ability do things with greater results, out of work. If AI is truly the future, it'll
be a terrible future to live in with laws like this.
