Response to The White House’s AI Action Plan: AIAIdeas' Proposal by 
Michael McPherson.  
Subject: AI -Driven Federal Budget Balancing System (AIAIdeas) – A 
Transformative Solution for Fiscal Sustainability and Economic Innovation  
Introduction  
The White House’s AI Action Plan underscores the transformative potential 
of artificial intelligence to enhance government efficiency, drive 
economic growth, and address national challenges. In response, we propose 
the AI-Driven Federal Budget Balancing System (AIAIdeas), a novel 
framework to eliminate the federal deficit, optimize resource allocation, 
and foster a public -private AI partnership. By leveraging AI -as-a-Service 
(AIaaS) through leased specialized agents from private companies, 
AIAIdeas aligns with the Administration’s goals of responsible AI 
deployment, economic competitiveness, and public benefit. Below, we 
detail its mechanism, benefits, and operating costs —minimal and medium 
scenarios for 2026 implementation —along with cost trade -offs to ensure 
feasibility and scalability.  
Mechanism and Partnership Model  
AIAIdeas establishes a cloud -based AI system under federal control, 
managed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or a dedicated task 
force. Specialized AI agents, leased from private companies via 
competitive bids, analyze budget data, identify waste, and propose 
savings and revenue strategies. This dual -objective system eliminates 
unbalanced budgets while generating profit for AI firms, creating a 
market-driven revenue stream. The partnership model incentivizes 
innovation, with contractors retaining IP rights and earning lease fees, 
mirroring successful cloud computing markets (e.g., AWS, Azure).  
Benefits  
Fiscal Responsibility: Targets the FY 2025 deficit of $1.9 trillion (CBO, 
January 2025) within a $7.0 trillion budget, aiming for 5 -27% savings 
($350B-$1.9T annually).  
Data-Driven Efficiency: Identifies overspending and optimizes resource 
allocation, minimizing waste.  
Innovation: Proposes cost -saving and revenue -generating solutions (e.g., 
predictive analytics for infrastructure, tax enforcement optimization).  
Economic Growth: Stimulates the AI sector, creating jobs and a multi -
billion-dollar market.  
Sustainability: Ensures long -term fiscal health via continuous 
monitoring.  


This aligns with the AI Action Plan’s emphasis on harnessing AI for 
economic and societal benefits while maintaining U.S. leadership in 
technology.  
Operating Costs for 2026 Implementation  
To operationalize AIAIdeas in FY 2026, we estimate minimal and medium 
annual operating costs, focusing on hardware, software, and operational 
essentials. Costs are kept low by leveraging existing federal IT systems 
(e.g., GSA Cloud Advantage contracts, USAspending.gov) and outsourcing AI 
development to private contractors.  
Minimal Operating Cost: $150 Million/Year  
Cloud Infrastructure (Hardware): $6M -$11M (10,000 petaflops compute at 
$0.50-$1/petaflop, 1 PB storage at $20K, $1M networking).  
Software (AI Agents): $100M (10 agents at $10M each) + $5M (open -source 
platform).  
Personnel: $3.5M (20 staff at $150K each, $0.5M training). 
Security: $5M (FedRAMP compliance, audits).  
Miscellaneous: $2M (setup amortized, contingency).  
Target Savings: 5% reduction ($350B).  
Cost-to-Savings Ratio: 0.043% ($150M ÷ $350B), a highly efficient 
investment.  
Assumptions: Lean deployment, basic AI capabilities, minimal staffing, 
and existing cloud contracts. This scenario prioritizes cost containment, 
achieving modest but immediate savings.  
Medium Operating Cost: $400 Million/Year  
Cloud Infrastructure: $25M -$35M (20,000 petaflops compute, 2 PB storage, 
$5M networking) for broader real -time analysis.  
Software: $300M (15 agents at $15M -$20M each) + $10M (enhanced platform 
with custom features).  
Personnel: $15M (50 staff, including data scientists at $200K -$250K each, 
$1M training).  
Security: $15M (advanced cybersecurity, penetration testing). 
Miscellaneous: $10M (expanded setup, 5% contingency).  
Target Savings: 10% reduction ($700B).  
Cost-to-Savings Ratio: 0.057% ($400M ÷ $700B), still exceptionally cost -
effective.  


Assumptions: Increased scale, more agents, and enhanced capabilities to 
double savings, requiring moderate investment in compute, staff, and 
security.  
Cost Trade -Offs  
Minimal ($150M) vs. Medium ($400M): The minimal approach sacrifices scale 
for affordability, targeting $350B savings with basic tools. The medium 
approach doubles savings ($700B) by investing in more agents and compute 
power, but increases costs by 167%. The trade -off is speed and ambition: 
$150M proves the concept with low risk, while $400M accelerates deficit 
reduction at a higher upfront cost.  
Hardware: Relying on cloud providers (minimal: $6M -$11M) avoids CapEx but 
limits control. Owning hardware (e.g., $50M -$100M/year for on -premises 
GPUs) could reduce long -term lease costs but requires significant initial 
outlay—unfeasible for 2026.  
Software: Minimal agent leases ($100M) assume competitive pricing; medium 
($300M) reflects higher fees for advanced agents or fewer bidders, a risk 
if market competition lags. Open -source platforms save millions but may 
lack robustness versus commercial solutions ($20M -$50M/year).  
Personnel: Minimal staffing ($3.5M) leverages existing expertise, risking 
burnout or errors; medium ($15M) hires specialists, improving accuracy 
but raising overhead.  
Savings Impact: A $250M cost increase (minimal to medium) yields $350B 
extra savings —a 1,400x return —suggesting the medium scenario’s trade -off 
is justified if political will supports deeper cuts.  
Alignment with AI Action Plan  
AIAIdeas advances the White House’s priorities:  
Safety and Trust: FedRAMP -compliant cloud and oversight ensure secure, 
ethical AI use.  
Economic Opportunity: Lease agreements create a $100M -$300M+ annual 
market for AI firms, fostering innovation.  
Government Efficiency: Automates budget tasks, freeing resources for 
policy priorities.  
Equity: Savings can be reinvested in underserved communities, though cuts 
must be monitored for fairness.  
Recommendation  
We propose launching AIAIdeas in 2026 at the minimal cost of $150M to 
demonstrate viability, targeting $350B in savings (5% reduction). Success 
could justify scaling to $400M in 2027, aiming for $700B (10% reduction), 
with costs offset by reallocating $92B in existing IT spending (GAO, 
2025). This staged approach balances fiscal caution with transformative 
potential, delivering a cost -to-savings ratio below 0.06% —an unparalleled 
return on investment.  
Conclusion  


AIAIdeas offers a groundbreaking solution to achieve fiscal 
sustainability while advancing U.S. AI leadership. Its minimal ($150M) 
and medium ($400M) operating costs for 2026 reflect a flexible, scalable 
model, with trade -offs favoring efficiency now and ambition later. We 
urge the Administration to pilot this system, aligning with the AI Action 
Plan’s vision of a stronger, more equitable future.
