General Comment
Generative AI should be heavily regulated and subject to the sam e laws that every other industry is. Currently the so-called AI system s in
use are incapable of creating anything unique, and steal artists work to generate their bad results. They should be forced to respect
copyright and not in any way given the ability to evade legal repercussions for copyright infringem ent.
