General Comment
The unregulated use of AI developm ent will not allow hum anity to florish, but rather just the corporations who are developing them .
Com panies that balantantly want to ignore the rights and protections of US Citizens for the sake of profits.
Proper regulations need to be put in place to protect citizens privacy, safety and respect the ownship of Intellectual Properties, including
those of sm all businesses and independant/contract workers who are at risk of their work being used to train AI system s to replace them .
There also needs to be regulations on the power consum pstion of these AI system s to lim it their potential im pact on electrical infrastructure
and the enviorm ent as a whole.
