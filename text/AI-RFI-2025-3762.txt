General Comment
The United States governm ent should not do anything to reduce the regulatory requirem ents on so called generative AI. Quite the
opposite, in fact: nearly all generative AI used today relies on the theft of m assive quantities of content for which the original creators were
not com pensated. The US governm ent m ust instead ensure that the com panies and organizations creating this generative AI are required
to fairly com pensate the original artists whose works com prise their corpus.
