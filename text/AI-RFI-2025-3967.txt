General Comment
If OpenAI and other AI Com panies are given special privileges with regards to intellectual property law, the US will be opening a
Pandora’s Box of IP infringem ent for anyone and everyone to abuse under the guise of “training AI”. If you wish to sink the last few truly
profitable Am erican com panies, by all m eans allow this flagrant self im m olation to continue. It will not end well for these already
unprofitable com panies regardless, and the US will already be at an even worse standing than our com petition in China.
