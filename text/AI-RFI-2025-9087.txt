General Comment
I do not at all believe that it should be legal for com panies like OpenAI to take copyrighted works and use it for their own profit. Even if
AI com panies claim  that they do not directly infringe on copyright, how can that be true when tools like ChatGPT can spit out paragraph
after paragraph of m aterial to the letter when it is given a prom pt to recite copyrighted works? AI is clearly stealing and abusing m aterial
that ought to be under protection.
AI steals from  com m on people who sim ply create their own works, and OpenAI, the biggest AI com pany to date, can't even m ake a
profit with the am ount of theft they currently perform . The work that they do is not fiscally sustainable, ergo I see no need to give their
industry such a big pass when it com es to stealing the work of others. I do not believe that their industry will m aterially benefit the public in
the future, and so I vehem ently disagree with any m otion to protect AI com panies from  copyright lawsuits.
