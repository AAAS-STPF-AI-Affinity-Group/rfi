General Comment
We should not be allowing AI to train on existing creative and academ ic works. The only thing generative AI is capable of doing is
regurgitating inform ation and likenesses that are already published, and in rem ixing those assets to create som ething "original," it can
generate m isinform ation or copyright-infringing recreations. If we use generative AI as a crutch, our entertainm ent industry will keep
reproducing the sam e stories and our students will keep reproducing the sam e argum ents. The original creations of our diverse hum an
population still have value, and I do not wish to see that underm ined by a m otion that would allow those with m ore financial and social
power to profit off of works derivative of the com m on people's original ideas.
