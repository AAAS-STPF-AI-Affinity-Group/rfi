General Comment
As a professional creative, AI not only steals from  the work of m yself and m y peers to power its generative results but directly threats our
livelihoods. It is an over-hyped solution looking for a problem  at the cost to taxpayers and the workforce, for som ething that is harm ing
the environm ent, Am erica's highly talented creatives of all disciplines, and the critical thinking skills of all. AI proliferates m isinform ation as
well as creative theft and should be highly regulated to prevent abuse by tech com panies against the Am erican workforce.
