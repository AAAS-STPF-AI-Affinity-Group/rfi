SETDA Response to the National Science Foundation (NSF) Request for Information 
on the Development of an Arti
ﬁ
cial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan (90 FR 9089, February 
6, 2025) 
SETDA  is the leading professional association representing U.S. state and territorial educational 
technology leaders. We support state education agencies in advancing digital learning, 
strengthening technology infrastructure, and integrating arti ﬁcial intelligence (AI) into education 
policy and practice. As NSF develops an AI Action Plan to sustain American leadership in arti ﬁcial 
intelligence, SETDA urges thoughtful consideration of AI’s role in education–ensuring responsible 
use to enhance teaching and learning. This aligns with Executive Order 14179, which calls for 
leveraging AI to “promote human ﬂourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.” 
In response to the NSF's Request for Information, SETDA encourages the NSF and the Networking 
and Information Technology Research and Development National Coordination Oﬃce to ensure that 
the administration’s AI Action plan includes the following ﬁve recommendations: 
1.Establish a Dedicated K-12 Educational Technology Grant Program  – Provide sustained
federal funding to support AI-driven innovations in teaching, learning, and school operations.
2.Expand Educator Preparation and Professional Development in AI – Ensure educators
have the knowledge, skills, and tools to integrate AI seamlessly into teaching and learning,
preparing students for a technology-rich world.
3 .Support Greater Educational Technology Research and Development – Invest in
research on AI’s impact in K-12 education to inform evidence-based policies and best
practices.
4.Commit to Removing Access Barriers – Ensure universal access to AI-powered learning
opportunities by closing digital divides in infrastructure, devices, and connectivity.
5.Develop National Guidance and Technical Assistance for AI-Powered Educational
Tools – Provide clear, research-backed guidance to help states and districts navigate AI
implementation responsibly.
These priorities align with SETDA’s 2025 EdTech Policy Agenda and the recommendations outlined 
in the Universal Connectivity Imperative Report and EdTech Quality Indicators Guide. 
Establish a Dedicated K-12 Educational Technology Grant Program  
Founded in 2001, SETDA is the principal association representing U.S. state and territorial educational technology and 
digital learning leaders. Through various programs and advocacy, SETDA builds member capacity and engages partners to 
empower the education community in leveraging technology for learning, teaching, and school operations. www.setda.org.


 
Federal
 
support
 
for
 
state
 
and
 
locally
 
driven
 
AI
 
education
 
initiatives
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
modernizing
 
learning
 
environments,
 
closing
 
digital
 
divides,
 
and
 
ensuring
 
all
 
students
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
AI-powered
 
opportunities.
 
To
 
maintain
 
the
 
United
 
States’s
 
leadership
 
in
 
AI,
 
SETDA
 
urges
 
NSF
 
to
 
recommend
 
that
 
Congress
 
adopt
 
a
 
dedicated
 
K-12
 
technology
 
grant
 
program
 
under
 
the
 
next
 
reauthorization
 
of
 
the
 
Elementary
 
and
 
Secondary
 
Education
 
Act
 
(ESEA).
 
 
A
 
new
 
AI-centric
 
EdTech
 
grant
 
program
 
should:
 
 
●
 
Provide
 
formula-based
 
funding
 
to
 
states
 
to
 
ﬂexibly
 
support
 
AI-integration
 
in
 
teaching,
 
learning,
 
and
 
infrastructure,
 
allowing
 
for
 
state-driven
 
approaches
 
that
 
meet
 
local
 
needs.
 
●
 
Oﬀer
 
competitive
 
grants
 
to
 
districts
 
and
 
consortia
 
for
 
innovative
 
AI-driven
 
educational
 
initiatives.
 
●
 
Encourage
 
the
 
establishment
 
of
 
state
 
educational
 
technology
 
oﬃces
 
to
 
oversee
 
and
 
support
 
AI
 
adoption
 
and
 
use.
 
 
 
This
 
approach
 
will
 
help
 
states
 
and
 
school
 
districts
 
sustain
 
and
 
expand
 
investments
 
in
 
technology-enabled
 
education,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
American
 
students
 
are
 
prepared
 
for
 
the
 
future.
 
It
 
also
 
aligns
 
with
 
the
 
vision
 
outlined
 
by
 
Executive
 
Order
 
14179
 
to
 
leverage
 
AI
 
for
 
national
 
competitiveness
 
and
 
educational
 
excellence.

leader
 
in
 
AI-enhanced
 
teaching
 
and

eﬀorts
 
are

Educators
 
must
 
be
 
equipped
 
with
 
the
 
skills

necessary
 
to
 
eﬀectively
 
integrate
 
AI
 
into
 
K-12

Report
.
 
 
Speciﬁcally,
 
SETDA
 
recommends
 
that
 
the
 
AI

encourage
 
Congress
 
to:
 
 
●
 
Increase
 
Title

$500
 
million
 
annually
,
 
with
 
20%
 
allocated
 
to
 
AI
 
and
 
educational
 
technology
 
professional
 
development.
 
●
 
Expand
 
funding
 
for
 
instructional
 
coaching
 
programs
 
to
 
sustainably
 
train
 
teachers
 
in
 
AI-assisted
 
instruction.
 
●
 
Strengthen
 
educator

to
 
include
 
AI
 
ethics,
 
cybersecurity,
 
and
 
adaptive
 
learning
 
technologies
 
and

Equipping
 
new
 
and
 
veteran
 
educators–as
 
well
 
as
 
school
 
leaders–with
 
AI
 
skills
 
will

●
 
Increase

AI
 
should
 
be

universally
 
and
 
responsibly,
 
with
 
rigorous
 
evaluation
 
of
 
its
 
impact
 
on
 
K-12
 
education.
 
Expanding
 
research
 
and
 
development
 
investment
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
advancing
 
global
 
AI
 
leadership,
 
as
 
outlined
 
in

14179.
 
 
 
Commit
 
to
 
Connecting
 
all
 
K-12
 
Students
 
and
 
Teachers
 
to
 
Broadband
 
for
 
AI
 
Ensuring
 
America’s
 
leadership
 
in
 
AI
 
requires
 
equipping
 
all
 
students
 
and
 
educators
 
with
 
reliable,
 
adequate,
 
high-speed
 
internet
 
to
 
access
 
AI-powered
 
tools.
 
The
 
SETDA
 
Universal
 
Connectivity
 
Imperative
 
Report
 
highlights
 
the
 
urgent
 
need
 
for
 
sustained
 
broadband
 
investment,
 
especially
 
in
 
rural
 
and
 
high-cost
 
areas,
 
where
 
access
 
remains
 
a
 
challenge.
 
 
To
 
position
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
as
 
the
 
preeminent
 
global
 
AI
 
leader,
 
we
 
must
 
also
 
be
 
the
 
world’s
 
most
 
digitally
 
connected
 
country.
 
With
 
that
 
goal
 
in
 
mind,
 
the
 
AI
 
Action
 
plan
 
should
 
recommend:
 
 
●
 
Protecting
 
and
 
expanding
 
the
 
E-Rate
 
program
 
to
 
support
 
AI-driven
 
teaching
 
and
 
learning
 
in
 
schools
 
and
 
libraries.
 
●
 
Ensuring
 
100/20
 
Mbps
 
broadband
 
as
 
a
 
minimum
 
standard
 
for
 
student
 
access,
 
enabling
 
seamless
 
AI-powered
 
instruction.
 
 
●
 
Establishing
 
permanent
 
federal
 
funding
 
for
 
broadband
 
aﬀordability
 
programs
 
to
 
prevent
 
connectivity
 
gaps,
 
especially
 
for
 
rural
 
and
 
low-income

AI
 
cannot
 
drive
 
learning
 
outcomes
 
without
 
universal,
 
aﬀordable
 
high-capacity
 
broadband
 
access.
 
Making
 
America
 
ﬁrst
 
in

connectivity
 
is
 
a
 
critical
 
step
 
toward
 
realizing
 
Executive

for
 
AI-driven

tiers
 
of
 
evidence
 
outlined
 
in
 
ESEA,
 
as

accessible
 
to
 
all
 
learners,
 
including
 
students
 
with

4.
 
Usable
 
–
 
AI
 
tools
 
should
 
integrate
 
seamlessly
 
into
 
educator
 
workﬂows.
 
5.
 
Interoperable
 
–
 
AI
