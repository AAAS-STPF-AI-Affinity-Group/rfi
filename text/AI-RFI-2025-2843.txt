General Comment
I am  writing today to state m y stance AGAINST developm ent of AI.
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
If AI is given blanket im m unity to create content by STEALING from  the AMERICAN PUBLIC, the Am erican econom y will suffer
greatly, to say nothing of the m yriad of other dangerous scenarios that will arise as a result.
