General Comment
AI is bad for industry and bad for education. Creativity is what drives innovation and com puters trained to recycle other peopleâ€™s work
(illegally and against copywrite) will only lead to stagnation. Artists hard work should not be used to line tech giants pockets. Ai should be
banned, not prioritized over people who work hard to m ake things that inspire and connect people.
