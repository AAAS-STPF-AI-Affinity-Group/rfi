Hello,
For more than a decade I have worked in publishing as an author, photographer, and editor. I
have to follow a great many rules regarding copyright, and those same rules protect me andthe work my company puts out. Allowing AI to simply override and overrule these rules is aslap in the face to real, working people. For shame.
