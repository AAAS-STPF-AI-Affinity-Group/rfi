General Comment
While AI's pattern recognition abilities have useful applications in fields like m edicine, generative AI is incapable of producing anything of
value, only serving to fill Google results and em ail inboxes with white noise garbage that people will ignore. It has m assive security issues
and very little value. 
People do not want hum an-m ade art replaced with bland nonsensical grey m ush. This is som ething being blindly pushed by out-of-touch
tech leads and CEOs who think it's a good way to get out of paying real Am ericans to create m ovies and other m edia, but this only shows
that they do not understand their product or their custom ers. Giving them  carte blanche to run roughshod over copyright laws that exist to
protect Am erican ideas and innovations will not change the fundam ental flaws of AI and will not convince Am erican consum ers to go see
m ovies with banal, thoughtless predictive text scripts and uncanny corpse-like "actors" whose faces m orph between scenes.
Do not devalue the work of the great Am erican people to feed this pyram id schem e. The generative AI bubble will inevitably pop
regardless of how m any dollars and freedom s you shovel into the engine. No need to allow it to cause even m ore dam age before investors
inevitably get wise to the scam .
