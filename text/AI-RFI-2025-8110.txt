General Comment
Gen AI should not and cannot be allowed to continue to feed off of copyrighted m aterials. The ability of Gen AI is strictly lim ited by being
able to m im ic the already created works and create a m irror visual that is com pletely uninspired and only serves to steal peoples' hard
worked labor without any of the actual understanding, knowledge, or skill it takes to create the item s the AI needs to be able to replicate
it. 
Do the right thing and protect peoples' integrity by not caving to big corporations existing only to profit off of the com m on m an's labor.
