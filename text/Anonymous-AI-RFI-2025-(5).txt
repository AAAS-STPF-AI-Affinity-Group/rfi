In developing our AI action plan, it is crucial to adopt a balanced approach that leverages both 
cutting-edge technological solutions and the insights provided by social science. Our strategy must modernize government data collection and processing—making operations more efficient and sustainable—while ensuring that human behavior and societal trends are captured through enhanced surveys, interviews, and real -time analytics. This dual emphasis aligns with the current 
administration’s focus on innovation and streamlined government processes. By integrating advanced AI tools with methodologies that reflect the nuances of public sentiment, we not only bolster national competitiveness but also build a resilient, agile data infrastructure. Such an approach supports effective governance, reduces administrative overhead, and promotes transparency and accountability—values central to driving American leadership in technology and economic growth.
