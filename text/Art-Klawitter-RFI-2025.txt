My greatest concern about artificial intelligence is that the artificial intelligence does not show its 
work. It is nearly impossible to see where the information comes from that arrives at a decision that 
is given back from artificial intelligence. I have  heard that if artificial intelligence doesnâ€™t have a 
reliable source for information that it will make up that source. The only reason science continues 
to advance is that scientist continue to question the validity of the data that has accumulated in the  
past. In retirement, we have visited two sites that illustrate the fact that we have lost technology in 
the past. Machu Picchu and Peru, where if you visit three different guides, you have three different 
explanations as to how these rocks were shaped and  put together. In visiting Egypt, they have not 
been able to prove how these rocks were put together and moved and quarried. These were 
technologies that were apparently available to us in the past during times that we had writing and 
documentation, but th ese secrets were not recorded and maintained. Artificial intelligence does 
not allow questioning from where the information comes. I have a retired physician, and 
unfortunately, my colleagues have become more students than colleagues. When I started in 
practice over 40 years ago, we had journal clubs that would critically evaluate articles to determine 
whether the information presented was actually true and useful. We now sit in lectures and have 
experts reading from slides that we diligently watch in an au dience and do not question. This does 
not advance science. We have lost significant trust from our patient by not critically, examine the 
information that we are presented.
