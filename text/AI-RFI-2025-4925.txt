General Comment
AI has no place in the future of U.S. national defense or industry, and is a technology with adverse effects, no significant dem and, and no
viable future. Tech com panies not solely reliant on the developm ent of the technology are already divesting from  AI developm ent, and
have done studies proving the harm  it causes out populace.
Furtherm ore, theft of copyrighted content is unconscionable and will hurt the livelihood of m any Am ericans. An industry that relies on such
theft is unsustainable.
AI is already being used to im personate, cheat, and m isinform  people all around the world. Rem oving further lim itations on the technology
will do nothing to solve these issues, instead exacerbating them .
