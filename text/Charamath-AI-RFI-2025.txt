This 'action plan' shows a tremendous amount of short-sightedness and lack of robust research or 
insight . It is plainly in favor of one major AI company and shows a complete lack of regard for 
literally any one el se and  the tremendous amount  of red flags active in th eir company,  including  
(but not limited to): the hundreds of thousands of citizens that AI company is currentl y stealing 
from who  are actively (successfully ) suing  them, their total lack to tu rn a profit despite 
BILLIONS i n investment, the ir constant movement of the goa lposts for their general artificial 
intelligence because they know they are nowhere near actually achieving it, to their lack of 
actually managing to generate much of anythi ng of actual value. Yeah, they have a chat bot, but 
all that's managed t o do is make user expe riences acr oss the world w orse. P eople ar e actively 
hating AI more and more because for all the shouting they've done t hey've only managed to 
make a ove r-hyped plagiarism machine. I've seen this reflected in current buying trends. People 
actively want a product LESS if AI (meani ng image and text generation) is involve d. Why 
should the government be giving ANY kind of preferential treatment, ESPECIALLY the ability 
to re-work laws in their favor, to a company that's primary exp ort is a lot of useless bull%^&*? 
All this will do is actively push even more of the USA's best and brightest to leave the country. 
You want the USA to remain a power-house? Then support the people behind the ideas OpenAI 
is currently trying to rip off, not the company whose definition of 'general artificial intelligence' 
changes every two months because they can't follow through with a goal despite more money 
invested in them than nearly every other business in existence.
