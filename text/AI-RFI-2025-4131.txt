General Comment
AI com panies have been using their technology to steal the work of artists and writers to train their m odels and then replace them  with
im ages no one wants and text that has to be thoroughly checked by a hum an anyway. The creation of these generative AI m odels takes
incredible am ounts of resources, from  electricity to fresh water. Reports have shown that they even rely on underpaid workers in other
countries, where horrible working conditions m ake their days m iserable. We need stronger regulations on AI and on these com panies, not
weaker regulations.
