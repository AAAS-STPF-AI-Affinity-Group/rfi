General Comment
I speak for every *actual* artist here, and that I'd VERY m uch rather have the rights to m y own art and ideas. Not som e lazy losers who
aren't even willing to m ake their own art. If this law passes, it'll be an absolute nightm are for us actual artists and creative people. And it
should go without saying, but it'd go against the whole point of copyright laws.
