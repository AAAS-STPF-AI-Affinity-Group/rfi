General Comment
I am  an engineer in the USA, I do not support the use of Artificial Intelligence in general practice of com m ercialism .
I do support the use of Artificial Intelligence in areas where a repetitive data driven focus is needed: folding proteins, iterative
electrical/physical design processes, translation of languages, and any other process that does not inherently require hum an creativity and
soul. 
Using Artificial Intelligence to create books, articles, works of art, or other creative or social endeavors (anything shared for hum an
intellectual consum ption) should not be allowed. This rem oves hum ans from  the equation of the world and prevents creativity from  thriving.
Artificial Intelligence is, at this tim e, unable to think creatively. It is only able to think within the bounds of what is has been fed to learn, as
such it cannot grow beyond those bounds.
Hum ans are what grow into the future, able to learn and think of new things. Artificial Intelligence is only able to think within the bounds of
our knowledge, it can find the part we have m issed or overlooked but ultim ately not m ove forward into the unknown. 
Focus on the helping solve the engineering problem s not replacing the critical thinking skills that hum an have.
