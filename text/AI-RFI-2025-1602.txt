Title: AI-based Neurom odulation in Clinical Trials – Im proving Rigor, Reproducibility and Econom ic Efficiency by Elim inating Traditional
Sham s
Sum m ary
Neurom odulation is an expanding field in precision m edicine, and includes therapies ranging from  invasive deep brain stim ulation (DBS) to
non-invasive transcranial m agnetic stim ulation (TMS), transcutaneous electrical nerve stim ulation (TENS), fMRI neurofeedback,
transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), and individualized neurom odulation (iNM). 
Traditional sham  m ethods involve deception, m isleading participants into believing they receive neurom odulation or receive incorrect
neurom odulation. This deceptive practice underm ines trust in clinical trials, raises ethical concerns about inform ed consent, and reduces
the interpretability and generalizability of findings. In contrast, im proved “sham ” control conditions elim inate deception. Im proved “sham ”
controls refer to any control condition that is characterized by transparency, and m ethodological rigor, and reproducibility. The goal is to
ensure participants are inform ed in advance that they will eventually receive treatm ent while elim inating deceptive interventions and boost
econom ic efficiency.
Im proved “sham ” control designs in AI-based neurom odulation clinical trials can enhance ethical integrity, econom ic efficiency,
interpretability, and generalizability by ensuring transparent inform ed consent, optim izing resource allocation, and im proving access to
treatm ent. This approach not only enhances patient trust but also im proves reproducibility of results, facilitating broader application across
broad patient populations.
How can we forego traditional sham  conditions? AI can enhance study design by addressing placebo effects while im proving causal


inference. 
Linear and/or non-linear AI m odels provide invaluable guidance for planning neurom odulation, especially real-tim e closed-loop
neurom odulation interventions. These AI m odels are crucial for increasing sensitivity and specificity to im prove therapeutic outcom es or to
enhance hum an perform ance.
Predictive m odeling for placebo effects involves training AI m odels on past neurom odulation studies to estim ate expected placebo
responses based on participant dem ographics, baseline neural activity, and prior response patterns. This enables statistical adjustm ents for
placebo-like effects without the need for a sham  group. Additionally, causal inference techniques, such as Bayesian Causal Networks and
Dynam ic Causal Modeling (DCM), can identify causal relationships between neurom odulation, physiological, and behavioral changes,
even in the absence of a sham  condition. These AI-driven approaches strengthen the study’s ability to detect true neurom odulatory effects
while m aintaining m ethodological rigor.

Title: AI-based Neuromodulation in Clinical Trials  – Improving Rigor, Reproducibility  and Eco nomic Efficiency  by 
Eliminating Traditional Shams  
Neuromodulation  is an expanding field in precision medicine , and includ es therapies  ranging  from invasive deep brain 
stimulation  (DBS) to non -invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation  (TMS) , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation  
(TENS) , fMRI neurofeedback , transcranial focused ultrasound  (tFUS) , and individualized neuromo dulation (iNM) . 
Traditional sham methods involve deception, misleading participants into believing they receiv e neuromodulation or receive 
incorrect neuromodulation . This deceptive practice undermines trust in clinical trials, raises ethical concerns about informed 
consent, and reduces the interpretability and generalizability of findings. In contrast, improved “sham”  control  conditions 
eliminate deception. Improved “sham” contro ls refer  to any control condition  that is characterized by  transparency , and 
methodological rigor , and reproducibility . The goal is to ensur e participants are informed in advance that they will eventually 
receive treatment while eliminating deceptive interventions  and boost economic efficiency.  
Improved “sham”  control designs in AI -based neuromodulation clinical trials can enhance ethical integrity, economic 
efficiency, interpretability, and generalizability by ensuring  transparent  informed consent, optimizing resource allocation, 
and improving access to treatment. This approach not only enhances patient trust but also improves reproducibility of results, 
facilitating broader application across broad  patient populations.  
How can we forego traditional sham condition s? AI can enhance study design by addressing placebo effects while  
improving causal inference.  
Linear and/or non -linear A I models provide inv aluable guidance for planning neuromodulation , especially  real-time closed -
loop neuromodulation intervention s. These AI models are crucial for increasing sensitivity and specificity to improve  
therapeutic outcomes or to enhanc e human performance.  
Predictive modeling for placebo effects  involves training AI models on past neuromodulation  studies to estimate expected 
placebo responses based on participant demographics, baseline neural activity, and prior response patterns. This enables 
statistical adjustments for placebo -like effects without the need for a sham group. Additionally, causal inference techniques , 
such as Bayesian Causal Networks and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM), can identify causal relationships between 
neuromodulation, physiological, a nd behavioral changes , even in the absence of a sham condition. These AI -driven 
approaches strengthen the study’s ability to detect true neuromodulatory effects while maintaining methodological rigor.  
Forgoing Unnecessary Regulatory Roadblocks 
Eliminating  outdated traditional sham protocols that involve misleading interventions benefits ethical , medical efficacy and 
safety,  and regulatory frameworks by reducing administrative hurdles. Aligning with federal policies such as the "2 -for-1" 
executive order (EO 13771) aimed at cutting excessive regulations, improve d “sham”  controls eliminate the need for 
deceptive interventions that often require complex regulatory oversight. This could help  fast-track FDA approvals for 
neuromodulation therapies, and enhance the generalizability of results by reducing variability introduced by misleading 
placebo conditions. A sham condition introduces additional variability because participants may respond differently based 


on their expectations, even in the absence of an actual treatment effect. Without a sham, all participants in the treatment a rm 
receive the active intervention, which can lead to more consistent neurophysiological responses. This could reduce inter -
subject  variability and improve the ability to detect true treatment effects.  By implementing transparent control designs, this 
approach maintains regulatory compliance without compromising scientific integrity or trial efficiency.  
 
Cost , Transparency & Economic Efficiency  
Mandating upfront cost disclosures for trial participation extends the administration’s healthcare price transparency 
initiatives, reinforcing financial accountability in research. Traditional sham -based control arms increase costs and 
undermine the interp retability of results . This can result in participant attrition , delay  trial completion , and redu ce 
meaningful scientific and clinical results  – the inability to offer the treatment  arm to the sham -based control  arm is often 
fisca lly and practically infeasible . By eliminating deceptive control arms and replacing them with ethically sound 
methodologies, clinical trials can optimize resource allocation, prevent unnecessary expenditures, and enhance data 
reliability. AI -driven predictive models and improved contro l designs can ensure cost -efficient, scalable methodologies 
while maintaining scientific rigor  and leading to more generalizable conclusions. To conc lude, removing unnecessary sham  
arms can accelerate participant recruitment, reduce trial durations, improve patient outcomes , and boost economic 
efficiency.  
 
Public -Private Partnerships & Industry Incentives  
Encouraging industry collaboration through tax breaks for trials using non -deceptive, improved  “sham ” controls foster  
innovation and strengthen  public -private partnerships. Venture capital firms investing in AI -driven healthcare solutions are 
more likely to support methodologies that reduce regulatory burden , enhance scientific validity, improve clinical trial  
feasibility and efficacy, and increase generalizability. By shifting toward market -driven models that emphasize ethical rigor 
and data transparency, this approach ensures that private investment supports reproducible, scalable research outcomes. 
Furthermore, improved “sham”  controls increase the interpretability of AI -driven neuromodulation models, making trial 
findings more applicable to broader patient populations.  
 
Implementation Strategy & Regulatory Adjustments  
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services could issue regulatory guidance allowing clinical trials to use no -
treatment control (improved “sham ” control) arms instead of sham procedures with associated risks (Johnson and Goebel, 
2023; i.e., If participation in a clinical trial imposes risks that subjects would not have been exposed to otherwise, those 
risks must be disclosed https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR -2014 -10-24/html/2014 -25318.htm ). Thus, we can replace 
sham controls with no-treatment control arms when:  
1. The sham procedure introduces novel risks (e.g., invasive placebo surgeries) . 
2. The risks are deemed unreasonable relative to the study’s societal value . 
In neuromodulation trials, traditional sham controls often involve invasive or deceptive interventions, such as implanting a 
device but not activating it or delivering simulated but ineffective stimulation. While these methods aim to serve as a place bo 
comparison, they can introduce unnecessary risks, including infection, procedural complications, and ethical concerns. By 
replacing tra ditional shams with  no-treatment control arms in cases where the sham intervention poses a risk, clinical trials 
could eliminate unnecessary exposure to harm while maintaining scientific integrity.  
 
How n o-treatment control arms compare to sham procedures in terms of patient outcomes : 
For example, i n ophthalmology trials measuring self -reported quality of life (e.g., NEI -VFQ scores for macular degeneration 
patients),  no significant differences  were found between sham and no-treatment controls when:  
• Participants were matched on baseline prognostic factors (e.g., visual acuity, age)  (Hawkins BS, Bressler NM, 
Reynolds SM. Patient -reported outcomes among sham vs no -treatment controls from randomized trials. Arch 
Ophthalmol. 2011 Feb;129(2):200 -5. doi: 10.1001/archophthalmol.2010.359. PMID: 21320967 ; Hawkins BS, 
Bressler NM, Reynolds SM. Visual acuity outcomes among sham vs no -treatment controls from randomized 
trials. Arch Ophthalmol. 2009 Jun;127(6):725 -31. doi: 10.1001/archophthalmol.2009.101. PMID: 195 06188 ). 
• Outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignmen t (Hawkins et al., 2009).  
This suggests sham procedures may be unnecessary for subjective outcomes when alternative bias -reduction methods 
(masked assessors) are used.  
 
Ethical and Safety Tradeoffs in Control Design  
Traditional s ham controls versus  no-treatment controls  (improved “sham ” controls)  present distinct ethical and practical 
tradeoffs in clinical trials, particularly when evaluating medical devices and neuromodulation interventions. Traditional 
sham procedures typically expose participants to a higher level of risk  (Sutherland, 2007). In contrast, no -treatment controls 


pose minimal risk since they do not involve unnecessary procedures. Traditional s ham controls often require some level of 
deception regarding treatment status, raising issues of informed consent and participant autonomy, whereas no -treatment 
controls allow full transparency. Additionally, traditional sham controls tend to be more expensive due to the costs 
associated with device preparation and procedural interventions, while no -treatment controls are more cost -effective.  
Practical Considerations in Trial Design  
Traditional s ham-controlled trials may face recruitment challenges, as potential participants might be deterred by perceived 
deception or the risks associated with unnecessary interventions  (Hawkins BS, Bressler NM, Reynolds SM. Patient -reported 
outcomes among sham vs no -treatment controls from randomized trials. Arch Ophthalmol. 2011 Feb;129(2):200 -5. doi: 
10.1001/archophthalmol.2010.359. PMID: 21320967; Hawkins et al., 2009) .  
It is imperative  that medical devices undergo rigorous, controlled testing to confirm their efficacy and reproducibility, but 
this should not come at the expense of patient safety through high -risk traditional sham procedures. Instead of exposing 
participants to unnecessary risks without therapeutic benefit, clinical trials should prioritize ethical, minimally invasive 
control conditions that maintain scientific validity while protecting patient welfare (Wright, Yale Law and Policy Review, 
2016) . This approach would also help streamline regulatory approval processes by reduc ing institutional review board (IRB) 
delays . Furthermore, eliminating high -risk traditional sham interventions aligns with the improved “sham”  control model, 
which advocates for ethical, transparent, and scientifically valid alternatives, such as AI -driven predictive  neuromodulation  
models and interventions . By shifting toward safer and more efficient control strategies, clinical  trial costs can be reduced, 
regulatory approvals can be accelerated, and the overall ethical standards of neuromodulation research can be enhanced  --
reinforcing the Administration’s AISIC objectives of promoting economic efficiency, scientific integrity, and responsible 
innovation.  
Long -Term Impact on R&D and Industry Standards  
Improved “sham” controls enhance the sustainability of neuromodulation research by reinvesting  clinical trial savings into 
future R&D. Th is transparent, no-treatment control design , which can leverage AI-enhanced methodology , sets a new 
industry standard  -- prioritizing medical safety , scientific reproducibility, cost efficiency, and ethical transparency. By 
eliminating deceptive placebo conditions, improved “sham” controls ensure that  clinical  trial results accurately reflect 
neuromodulation’s true physiological effects, while strengthening both interpretability  and generalizability  in clinical 
research.  
Interpretability  refers to  that study ’s results being  explainable, reproducible, and scientifically valid. Traditional sham -
controlled neuromodulation trials obscure true treatment effects, making it difficult to distinguish real neuromodulation 
responses from placebo -driven changes. Improved “sham” control designs remove decepti ve and misleading interventions, 
allowing clear identification of causal relationships between neuromodulation and patient outcomes.  
Generalizability  determines how well clinical trial results are similarly  efficacious  in broader patient populations. 
Traditional sham  clinical  trials create artificial conditions that fail to reflect real -world treatment effects, limiting their 
clinical relevance. Improved “sham” controls maintain valid control conditions while financially a ffording  all participants 
eventually receive active treatment  -- making findings more applicable across patient groups. AI -driven monitoring in 
clinical trials further enhances generalizability by dynamically adjusting treatment protocols based on real -time 
physiological responses rather than traditional , rigid  sham conditions.  
By optimizing clinical trial designs to maxi mize  interpretability  and generalizability , improved “sham” controls establish 
a scientifically rigorous, medically safer, ethically sound, and clinically -robust approach. We can  achieve this by:  
1.Enhancing Interpretability:  Eliminating deceptive placebo conditions allows researchers to directly assess
neuromodulation’s effects . This can improv e regulatory decision -making and accelerat e the process from the
“bench -to-bedside.”
2.Improving Generalizability:  Results reflect real -world therapeutic outcomes, which expan ds applicability to
patient populations.
3.Optimizing AI -Driven Predictive Models:  Adaptive AI monitoring refines treatment protocols, improv es
responder identification , and provides  individualized , effective neuromodulation therapies.
Adaptive trial designs enable individualized neuromodula tion adjustments (e.g., dosage, treatment duration) using AI 
analysis of patient  data. This reduces trial failure risks and improves patient safety. (BioPharma Trend. 2024, October 11 .

This shift not only advances neuromodulation research but also aligns with broader industry trends toward ethical, efficient, 
and data -driven clinical trial methodologies.  
Conclusion  
Improved “sham” control designs in neuromodulation trials enhance  medical safety, clinical trial efficacy, rigor, and 
reproducibility, while also improving deregulation, economic efficiency, and market -driven innovation . Unlike traditional 
placebo methods, improved “sham ” controls eliminate unnecessary medical risks for patients, and ensur e they receive active 
interventions rather than deceptive or ineffective procedures. AI -driven optimi zation and clinical  trial monitoring enhances 
interpretability and scalability, making trials more ethical and cost -effective. By reducing bureaucratic burdens and clinical  
trial costs while minimizing risk, we can  optimize federal research investments and accelerate access to transformative 
treatments.
