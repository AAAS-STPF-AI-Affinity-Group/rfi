General Comment
As a citizen and artist, I vehem ently oppose OpenAI's theft of intellectual property. If left unchecked, it will dam age the livelihoods of
thousands of Am erican citizens. It is a dead-end technology that is a waste of energy and financial resources. History will look on deep
learning m odels like those of OpenAI as either a fad or a deep stain on hum anity.
