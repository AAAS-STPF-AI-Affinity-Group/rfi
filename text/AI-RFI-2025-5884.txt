General Comment
AI com es in m any form s, such as Machine Learning, where the datasets are legally acquired and used for a legitim ate purpose like
healthcare diagnostics, could potentially be beneficial.
Others exam ples include Generative AI. Generative AI a force of theft and destruction that is buoyed by flagrant violation of copyright
law. 
In all cases, it is the responsibility of governm ent to protect people, prevent abuse, and to actually regulate industries with the potential for
great harm . Any governm ent use of AI m ust be done so transparently (no secret algorithm s/form ulae). 
You m ust not use any AI program s to m ake decisions. Com puters cannot be held responsible, only people can, and abdicating the
authority to m ake decisions is what this focus on AI could bring. 
Do not abdicate your responsibility to uphold the law and let copyright theft be the norm . Protect peoples privacy and authorship. 
Generative AI com panies are burning the earth for nothing.
