General Comment
As a sm all independent publisher m y business relies on m y uniquely created content. I go to real places to experience things and share
with m y audience. Allowing AI to scrape from  the content I work hard to produce underm ines m y business and intellectual property. AI is
terrible for the environm ent, the output is often incorrect and it is already a huge m ess online where people canâ€™t tell what is real from  what
is not. We need better protections from  AI.
