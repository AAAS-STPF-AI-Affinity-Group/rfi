General Comment
Com m ent on AI Action Plan
This docum ent is approved for public dissem ination. The docum ent contains no business-proprietary or confidential inform ation.
Docum ent contents m ay be reused by the governm ent in developing the AI Action Plan and associated docum ents without attribution.
Both governm ent entities and private sector organizations are crucial for the advancem ent of AI innovation. Governm ent agencies such as
the NSF have an im portant role to play in supporting the developm ent of AI technologies that serve pressing societal needs but are less
likely to be prioritized by com m ercial developers. Innovative AI tools that support the educational needs of all children, especially children
with disabilities, are essential for growing and m aintaining an Am erican workforce that is globally com petitive. Schools, both public and
private, do not have great financial resources. Therefore, private sector developers m ay not choose to invest their efforts in technology for
education. However, governm ent agencies can afford to take a long view, investing in the future of the United States of Am erica. I
strongly urge that the AI Action Plan will create policies that prom ote hum an flourishing and in turn, econom ic com petitiveness, by defining
a m ajor role for governm ent-sponsored research in AI for education. Partnerships between governm ent and the private sector are likely to
be part of these policies, but governm ent m ust take the lead.
