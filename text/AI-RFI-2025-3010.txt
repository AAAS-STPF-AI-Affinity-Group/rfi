General Comment
Shielding AI com panies from  liability due to their theft of content from  the open Internet is definitely the wrong m ove here. In no other
industry can you actively (nor legally) steal copyrighted m aterial to essentially resell to people. AI com panies need to be held financially
accountable for all of their theft over the past few years, and if this m eans the death of Generative AI as we know it, then so be it. If your
industry requires theft to stay afloat, your industry should not exist. 
Generative AI has produced nothing of value in the several years that it has been in developm ent, and it does not look like it will start
doing so any tim e soon. In essence you have a chat bot that often spews m isinform ation and outright m akes up sources to statem ents it
"hallucinates." The investm ent m oney that AI com panies have been receiving could be better spent elsewhere on things that actually have
benefits.
