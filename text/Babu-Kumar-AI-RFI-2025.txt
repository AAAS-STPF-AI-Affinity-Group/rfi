Dear Mr. D’Souza,
Are you focused on developing new AI technologies or would you be interested in the application of  
AI technologies to address various problems.
Here at S&T, the Air Cargo program is developing Computerized Tomography scanners that can  
screen Air Cargo skids. We are also involved in applying AI based software to help detect anomalies  
and threats in these cargo skids. Would this be of any interest?
With best regards,
Kumar
