General Comment
Artificial intelligence, especially in the creative endeavors has an ideal of being used for saving labor, bringing talent to sm aller projects,
and enhancing the efforts of those already skilled at various crafts.
In actuality, the effects of AI often leads to REPLACING the skilled workers, both stealing their efforts and taking their job prospects.
While autom ating m anual labor is often a helpful task to reduce injury and strain, in creative works it serves less of purpose other than to
optim ize hum ans out of a uniquely hum an activity som ething m ost who do it ENJOY the tim e put into doing it. 
I want AI to do m y laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do m y art and writing so that I can do m y laundry
and dishes. - Joanna Maciejewska
