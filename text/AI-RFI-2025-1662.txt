General Comment
A.I., specifically generative AI, needs to be heavily regulated to protect not only artists, writers, and actors, but also the general public of
Am erica.
A.I has, and will be, used to trick people. Making im age that show or say som ething unture, copying a person voice or likeness without
their consent, and putting m any Am ericans out of a job.
A.I is also blatant copyright infringem ent, and A.I m odels need to use vast am ounts of data to build their system , and m ost of this data is
copyrighted m aterial used without the creators knowing consent.
I say we can not allow AI and these com panies run around without restrictions, and they m ust be regulated
