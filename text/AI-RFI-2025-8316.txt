General Comment
GenAI does not have a place in our society. Not only it steals jobs from  hard working Am ericans, it also does m assive harm  to
environm ent as GenAI requires ALOT of water and electricity. GenAI also m akes jobs at risks, such as artists, actors, m usicians, and
graphic designers to nam e a few. GenAI also m akes subpar and abysm al products as it looks unappealing and an im itation to actual
hum an beings m aking art.
