General Comment
The so-called "AI" that we all know this is referring to (e.g. Large Language Models) is nothing m ore than a VERY expensive and flashy
parlor trick. It would be a waste of tim e and resources for the nation to invest in it. By its very nature, it is fundam entally UNRELIABLE
for inform ation, and its usage for other kinds of m edia, outside of com pletely frivolous uses, is invariably a sign of m ism anagem ent and
shoddy products. The USA does not need to m ake itself look WORSE, by using AI junk. Especially in som ething as im portant as
security, it would only cause terrible dam age.
