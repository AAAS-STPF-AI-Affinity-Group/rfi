General Comment
Please do not give OpenAI (and other Generative AI com panies) a free pass to com pletely ignore the laws and regulations we give to
everybody else. Com puters can process this work so m uch faster than hum ans, they should have to pay just as m uch, if not m ore, than
everybody else. If their com panies cannot survive following the laws, then they clearly cannot and should not survive.
