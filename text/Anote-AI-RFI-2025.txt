Introduction 
AI has been advancing rapidly, and is progressing at an exponential pace with models and 
innovations such as GPT, SORA, Gemini, Claude and AlphaFold all coming out every few months. 
Despite this, most people in America are strangers to this AI technology, and haven’t used 
ChatGPT or any AI technology. For America to stay ahead in the AI race, we need to focus on 
helping train and develop our AI workforce, and prevent American people from falling behind.  
From a global perspective, America is directly competing with China in the AI race. America has 
many incredible AI companies such as OpenAI’s GPT, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude. China 
has rece ntly made a lot of progress with models such as Alibaba’s Qwen, Deepseek’s R1 and 
Manus’ General AI Agent. While America is still ahead in the AI race, there is significant risk of 
our lead diminishing over time. One cause is the data, where China has access to larger 
quantities of data to help train powerful machine learning models.  
Today there is a data gap between the models being used to train LLMs like Anthropic’s Claude 
and OpenAI’s GPT, and the amount of privately held data within the US government and various 
agencies within the DOD. As a result, the performance of AI models for many defense related 
use cases is quite limited. To account for this: 
Recommendation 1: Different governmental agencies should leverage their own data to train 
and fine-tune domain-specific large language models for government-related use cases. 
To effectively do this, the government will need to aggregate, label and convert its own 
structured and unstructured data into a format that can be used to train powerful models, and 
then customize the models to be specific for a variety of use cases. There should be clear 
evaluation metrics for each of these use cases, and the ability to measure a variety of models on 
these evaluation metrics. From a technical infrastructure perspective, Anote has provided a lot 
of guidance on best practices for this, and we have open sourced our human centered AI 
methodology and code, documentation  and research for details here.

Another pressing cause of this risk to losing the AI war is related to workforce development. 
Many people within America still do not know much about artificial intelligence, so despite the 
tremendous progress of AI technology, many people are getting left behind. People within the 
workforce that know how to use AI are starting to replace those who don’t know how to use AI. 
From a national perspective, within America our artificial intelligence technology brings a high 
likelihood of the automation of both white collar and blue collar jobs. There is a significant risk 
that 20 to 40% of jobs within America will be replaced in the next 5 to 10 years. Jobs such as 
data entry clerks, insurance underwriters, financial analysts and medical transcriptionists are at 
risk. While new job opportunities will arise from the advancement of AI, people within America 
need to learn how to use AI to be able to effectively do these new jobs. 
We want to help people stay ahead of the AI curve and have a say on where this technology 
should be applied. We need to take immediate action to help members of AI communities 
around the USA learn about how to use AI in practice in their everyday lives. To combat this 
issue, we need to develop our workforce and train them with AI related skills.  
There is a need for an AI Action Plan to help America stay ahead in the AI race, and to help US 
Citizens not be left behind from the AI technological revolution. As a culmination of thousands 
of interviews and hundreds of conversations with industry partners, our team developed an AI 
Action Plan for the United States, focused on AI education and workforce development . This 
document outlines our recommendations on AI education, workforce development and 
accessibility to help shape an inclusive national AI Action Plan.

AI Action Plan Overview 
Our AI Action Plan focuses on workforce development, and consists of four critical components: 
1. Aggregation and curation of AI related data: This consists of hubs for:
a.AI job opportunities from industry partners
b.AI trainings and educational resources for learning
c.AI talent pool with interested community members
2. Distribution and dissemination of AI content: This consists of hubs for:
a.AI related events and meetups
b.AI newsletter with up to date AI news
c.AI social media outreach (linkedin / youtube)
3. Collaborations and Partnerships between members: This consists of hubs for:
a.AI related partnership opportunities on contracts
b.AI consortium of researchers and industry partners
c.AI data sharing of datasets, evaluation benchmarks, models and agents
4.Engagement to bring the AI community together: This consists of hubs for:
a.AI slack / whatsapp community for centralized AI communications
b.AI open source projects that community members can contribute to
c.AI members portal to find other community members to connect with
This AI Action Plan should be implemented on a national level as well as a state / city (local) 
level, with different sub-communities with local resources for specific areas of interest. For each 
local sub-community, AI resource curation (news, events, venues, speakers, jobs, talent) should 
be specifically curated for that local community. We propose the name of this plan to be the 
Armor Institute, and to be an open project where all people can contribute. 
Aggregation and curation of AI related data for Job Opportunities, Trainings and Talent Pool: 
The proliferation of AI training initiatives – while positive – has led to a fragmented landscape. 
Multiple government agencies run programs that support AI workforce development, but these 
can operate in silos or lack a unified platform for stakeholders to navigate. There is a clear gap in 
aggregating information and matching supply with demand. For instance, a community college 
might develop an AI course, but local employers might not be aware of the talent pipeline being 
created; conversely, tech companies have training resources that educators or workforce boards 
might not easily find or incorporate. The absence of a central place for AI workforce 
opportunities diminishes the potential synergy among programs. 
Page 4 of 12 


Recommendation 2: Create a centralized digital platform that aggregates AI workforce 
resources – a one-stop portal where individuals, job seekers, employers, and educators can 
find and share information on training programs, job openings, apprenticeships, mentorship 
opportunities, and events across the country.  
As far as job opportunities, having a platform that would allow a user to see, for instance, all AI 
apprenticeship programs or entry-level AI job postings in one place, would be quite helpful. The 
platform should integrate with existing resources (like AI.gov or WorkforceGPS) and incorporate 
AI tools (e.g. personalized skill assessments and career navigation powered by AI). This also 
should contain high quality jobs by strong industry and enterprise partners, and can contain 
some of the AI related listings from AI job sources such as LinkedIn and Indeed as well. By 
aggregating job opportunities, this platform can help match talent to opportunities at scale.  
We recommend classifying the opportunities as training programs for early stage career 
members, apprenticeship programs which will help place people in AI jobs, and mid-level / 
senior level training for upskilling. Based on the category of training and job opportunities, 
community members can be matched with the appropriate training and AI learning program for 
their current stage of development. The Department of Labor should streamline the registered 
apprenticeship process for AI and IT roles (simplifying standards and paperwork) to encourage 
small and mid-sized companies to host apprentices. Mid-career and senior workers whose jobs 
are changing due to AI could benefit from short courses or certificates, so a governmental AI 
learning and AI Training grant could reimburse workers for approved AI courses would be 
beneficial. In partnership with employers, such grants could be co-funded by companies that 
identify roles for which they want to retrain staff rather than resorting to layoffs. 
As far as trainings, we would recommend including the following AI resources to help 
community members with different skill levels learn more about how to practically use AI: Name Website URL

Inspirit AI https://www.inspiritai.com/ 
Page 5 of 12 


As far as the talent pool, all talent should have access to specific job opportunities and training 
resources. Organizations such as Breakthrough Tech help provide AI training opportunities to a 
variety of college students, and organizations such as Inspirit AI are helpful for high school 
students looking to learn more about AI. Companies like Daimlas AI help curate local AI 
resources for each specific region, and non-profits like AI Blueprints is a great example of a local 
AI resource curation hub in Boston. We think that a central community ecosystem in the USA 
would be amazing, in an open model where people who want to learn can easily participate. 
Distribution and dissemination of AI content with AI Events and an AI Newsletter 
Even where AI training, job opportunities and programs exist, awareness and engagement can 
fall short. Many job seekers and current workers are not aware of the AI training opportunities 
available to them, or may not see AI skills as relevant to their career if they are outside the tech 
sector. Similarly, industry-led programs (like corporate online academies or certifications) 
sometimes struggle to attract the very populations most in need of upskilling (e.g., workers in 
industries being disrupted by AI). Thus, there is an engagement gap not only at the individual 
level, but at the employer level: many companies that could benefit from AI training programs 
(to retrain their employees or hire new AI talent) are not yet plugged into the ecosystem of 
workforce initiatives. This suggests a need for better outreach, user-friendly program design, 
and incentives to broaden participation.  
Recommendation 3: Encourage community-driven initiatives such as AI events and AI 
newsletters to help engage the public in AI learning and career development.  
AI may seem intimidating or irrelevant to many Americans; demystifying it requires meeting 
people where they are. We recommend hosting AI learning events – from introductory 
workshops to AI hackathons addressing local issues – to bring local communities together 
around learning more about practical AI applications. Digital platforms could promote these 
events widely, acting as a distributor of engagement opportunities so that a student in a small 
town can easily find a virtual AI meetup or a nearby community college seminar. Community 
colleges, given their integral role in local workforce development, should receive support to 
become hubs for AI engagement. We recommend the following companies for AI events: Company Company URL

We propose a phased rollout to establish AI meetup chapters in new cities. In Phase 1, we 
suggest focusing on launching 3–5 new city meetups (for example, Boston, Washington D.C., 
and Chicago) where there is already substantial tech and academic presence to build upon. In 
Phase 2, we suggest expanding to additional cities such as Miami, Austin, and others across the 
South and West, including potentially West Coast locations.  Below you can find some 
recommended cities to expand to in the USA, though we think this should also be largely 
accessible to more rural areas and inner cities where these hubs don’t currently exist: City State Priority  Target Launch Date 
New York NY Current Hub Active 
Toronto CANADA Current Hub Active 
Washington DC Phase 1 Q1 2025 
Boston MA Phase 1 Q1 2025 
Chicago IL Phase 2 Q1 2025 
Miami FL Phase 2 Q2 2025 
Atlanta GA Phase 2 Q2 2025 
Austin TX Phase 2 Q2 2025 
Los Angeles CA Phase 3 Q3 2025 
San Diego CA Phase 3 Q3 2025 
Seattle WA Phase 3 Q3 2025 
Mountain 
View CA Phase 4 Q4 2025 
San Francisco CA Phase 4 Q4 2025 
Berkeley CA Phase 4 Q4 2025 
This approach allows you to pilot the meetup model in a variety of settings and refine our 
playbook before nationwide expansion. For each new chapter, we recommend recruiting a local 
AI Community Lead responsible for on-the-ground organizing. Once initial meetups are 
successfully established and local momentum builds, we suggest chapters will operate on a 
Page 7 of 12 


regular monthly schedule with oversight and coordination from Anote’s central team (to share 
resources, speaker opportunities, and lessons learned across cities). This systematic expansion 
plan will enable us to maintain quality and consistency as we grow, while also tailoring each 
city’s events to its local community interests. 
Crucially, these community efforts should highlight inclusive participation. They should be 
marketed to underrepresented demographics – for example, AI training programs for women 
re-entering the workforce, AI literacy courses for older workers at community centers, and 
collaborations with organizations serving people with disabilities to ensure content is accessible. 
By infusing AI learning into the fabric of community life and online social learning, we normalize 
the idea that AI skills are for everyone, not a niche group.  
To execute on this distribution method, we recommend an AI Newsletter such as Digestible AI 
to be disseminated to community members, with the purpose of breaking down complex AI 
topics into clear, actionable AI insights that are accessible to both technical and non-technical 
audiences. In addition, social media and online learning communities can be powerful. The 
government could facilitate the creation of an AI Community of Practice Platform – an online 
forum where learners, experts, and mentors interact, share projects, and answer questions.  
Collaboration and AI Partnership Opportunities Between Community Members 
Despite the multitude of programs underway, significant gaps exist in the current AI workforce 
development landscape. These gaps relate to who can access opportunities, where programs 
are deployed, how well efforts are coordinated, and alignment between training outcomes and 
industry needs. The way we propose solving this is via aggregating many AI resources, and then 
sharing these resources to help people engage at a large scale. Central to this plan involves 
collaborations and partnerships with a variety of different industry and community members.  
Recommendation 4: Expand AI Partnerships with Incentives for Industry Collaborations. We 
propose sharing contract opportunities, and developing a consortium of industry members, 
Page 8 of 12 


enterprises, universities and governmental agencies, where groups will collaborate on a 
variety of AI projects and initiatives:  
While many companies are voluntarily investing in AI training, a formal public-private 
partnership program can align these efforts with national workforce goals. We recommend 
developing an AI consortium where different community members can meet each other and 
collaborate on a variety of publicly available opportunities. We recommend sharing these 
opportunities on a publicly accessible portal, where members can view them, meet each other 
and partner in the most optimal ways. Name Link

We suggest building a consortium of AI experts and stakeholders from institutes and companies 
across America . The goal of this consortium would be to unite academia, industry, and the tech 
community in a shared mission: developing the workforce’s AI skills through real-world projects 
and knowledge-sharing forums. By bringing together AI researchers, practitioners, and 
enthusiasts under one umbrella, we can ensure that American people and companies benefit 
from the latest AI breakthroughs and industry best practices. Our team has created such a 
consortium, with a variety of industry partners and research organizations, to help build local AI 
hubs and collaborate on AI project initiatives across America. AI Sharing of Evaluation Datasets, Models and AI Agents 
Bringing industry partners, researchers from universities, and members of the talent pool 
together is the first step. However, there needs to be alignment on the datasets, models and 
Page 9 of 12 


tasks that community members will collaborate on. To improve alignment between education 
and industry needs, the government should champion the development of open standards for 
AI related projects, that way everyone can be aware of ways to contribute.  
Recommendation 5: Foster Data Sharing and Alignment through Open Standards, by 
developing open source datasets, models, agents and projects where anyone can contribute:  
When it comes to evaluation datasets for benchmarks, industry standard models, and AI agents, 
there should be open hubs where members of AI related communities in the USA can share 
these resources in an open way to benefit fellow AI researchers. On the evaluation datasets and 
benchmarks point, there could be a hub where people would share specific testing datasets 
(filterable by task types). For each of these testing datasets, community members can submit AI 
models to see how each industry standard model compares on that testing dataset. Our 
company, Anote, has developed a model leaderboard for this capability, where community 
members can share how models like GPT, Claude, Mistral, Llama and Grok compare on a variety 
of benchmarks - we can help build an analogous portal but for certified AI models and 
evaluation benchmarks pertinent for government use cases. 
On the point of AI agents, one key problem is that while AI agents are becoming more and more 
ubiquitous, it is difficult to productionalize AI agents, and it is hard to find and share the agents 
that have been created. We recommend creating an analogous AI agent hub, where agents that 
are particularly helpful for important defense use cases can be shared with other members of 
the USA AI community. Our team at Anote has actually already developed a hub for agents for 
traditional commercial use cases (email marketing, AI assisted coding, financial analysis, etc.), 
and would be happy to help expand this to aid with American interests. 
Page 10 of 12 


We also believe that community members should be encouraged to collaborate on open 
sourced AI initiatives, so long as they benefit American interests. We recommend organizations 
such as the Linux Foundation, who have built incredible communities of developers to help 
augment existing AI projects. Our team at Anote has released two open source projects – the 
first on our MLOps Platform for labeling data, training models, making predictions and 
evaluating the results of LLMs, and the second on an AI agent platform for collaborative, 
intelligent autonomous multi agent AI systems.  
We invite members to contribute to these projects, and think that it would be nice if community 
members could meet each other via centralized communications. Perhaps there should be a 
slack / whatsapp community, or an AI members portal to find other community members to 
connect with. Regardless, to successfully foster data sharing and openness, figuring out a way to 
connect people and have them engage in a collaborative capacity is a prerequisite. 
For Anote, we have figured out a way to engage a vibrant AI community in the USA. Our Slack 
community has grown to over 1,000 dedicated members who actively exchange ideas, 
collaborate on projects, and support one another’s growth. Additionally, our partner Mindstone 
connects more than 13,000 members, creating a dynamic ecosystem where expertise and 
innovation meet. We hosted an AI Day Summit 2025, a landmark event that brought together 
over 50 speakers and attracted thousands of attendees from across the country. The summit 
showcased a diverse range of topics—from AI research to real-world applications. With all talks 
recorded and posted online , the wealth of knowledge shared during the event remains 
accessible to anyone interested in the future of AI. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, Anote strongly supports the NSF’s efforts to develop a comprehensive AI Action 
Plan that ensures no American is left behind in the age of AI. Our recommendations focus on 
empowering people through education and community-building, which we believe are 
fundamental to bridging the gap between rapid AI advancements and the public’s ability to 
understand and leverage these tools. By scaling up initiatives like AI meetups, workshops, and Page 11 of 12 


collaborative projects – and by providing the necessary support and partnerships – we can 
foster an inclusive AI ecosystem where innovation is democratized. With strategic support, what 
we have accomplished can be expanded nationwide, cultivating a generation of AI-literate 
citizens and a workforce ready to drive AI-enabled growth in every sector. Anote is committed 
to this mission of accessible AI for all, and we stand ready to collaborate with policymakers, 
industry, and academia to implement the vision outlined in this response. Together, we can 
shape an AI future that is inclusive, empowering, and beneficial to society as a whole.
