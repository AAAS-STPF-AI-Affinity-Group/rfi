General Comment
My nam e is Jayla Jones and I am  a m em ber of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High School. I com pleted a sem ester course on
AI and Ethics and studied the im pacts of Generative AI on the environm ent and energy consum ption. AI technology is a resourceful tool
but is also a large concern in the topic of energy consum ption and efficiency. I have found in research that AI uses and em its large am ounts
of energy and creates an inflated carbon footprint. EO 14179 will disrupt safe energy consum ption and the safety of the environm ent and
em ission levels.
