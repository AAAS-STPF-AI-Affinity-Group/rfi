General Comment
I am  a writer who is sickened, saddened, and repulsed by the proliferation of large language m odels as m ythical "generative AI."
Multinational corporations have now spent years illegally and unethically plagiarizing m y work and that of thousands of other creators to
fatten their own profit m argins on technology that is sim ultaneously inaccurate, wasteful, and unwanted.
Do not allow the further proliferation of this disastrous technology. Every hum an who creates is dam aged by what technocrats are trying to
do right now. Stop this.
