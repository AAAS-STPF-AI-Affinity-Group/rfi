General Comment
We do not need less restrictions on people developing A.I, we need m ore protections for the rest of us. 
How instead you worry about protecting the people whose work gets stolen to "train" A.I? How about you work on ensuring benefits for
real Am ericans instead of fretting that suits are being ham pered by regulations.
