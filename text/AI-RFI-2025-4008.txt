General Comment
OPEN AI does not provide anything to deserve the com plete right to steal everything the Am erican people have created. 
OPEN AI has proven nothing in regards to its ability to m ake anything of note, it’s just a slop com pany — and it’s proven worthless. 
Let it flop before we becom e m ore invested and it takes m ore of us down with it.
