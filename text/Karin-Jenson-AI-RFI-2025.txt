Greetings,
In response to the White House’s Request for Information (RFI) on the development of an  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan, Two Rivers AI Consulting submits the following  
comments, focusing on enhancing access and education for small businesses to effectively  
leverage AI in addressing uncertainty and resource constraints.
Two Rivers AI Consulting is a firm led by AI longtimer Karin Jenson that is focused solely on 
bringing AI to Central Michigan family and privately owned small businesses.
1. Importance of AI Adoption for Small Businesses
Small businesses are critical to the survival of the middle class and the U.S. economy,  
contributing significantly to innovation and employment. However, they often face challenges  
such as limited resources and heightened uncertainty. AI offers tools that can help mitigate  
these issues by improving efficiency, decision-making, and competitiveness. For instance, AI  
can assist in forecasting inventory levels, evaluating customer preferences, and optimizing  
operations.
2. Current State of AI Adoption
Recent studies indicate a growing interest among small businesses in adopting AI  
technologies. Approximately 23% of small businesses currently utilize AI in some capacity,  
with an additional 39% planning to integrate AI tools in the near future. Despite this interest,  
many small businesses encounter barriers such as lack of expertise, financial constraints, and  
uncertainty about implementation.
3. Recommendations for Enhancing AI Access and Education
a. Develop Targeted Educational Programs
Establish accessible educational initiatives that provide small business owners and their  
employees with the knowledge and skills necessary to implement AI solutions. These  
programs should include practical workshops, online courses, and certification opportunities  
tailored to various industries and levels of technical proficiency. For example, Estonia’s  
national initiative, AI Leap, aims to teach AI skills to high school students in collaboration  
with tech companies, preparing them for future jobs and promoting critical thinking. Vice  
President Vance alluded to this type of training in schools in his Paris speech, but it must also  
be available to the American workforce.
b. Provide Financial Incentives and Support


Introduce grants, subsidies, or tax incentives to reduce the financial burden associated with
adopting AI technologies. This support can help small businesses invest in necessary
infrastructure, software, and training. Additionally, public-private partnerships can facilitateaffordable access to AI tools and resources.
c. Foster Collaborative Communities and NetworksEncourage the formation of networks and communities where small businesses can share
experiences, challenges, and best practices related to AI adoption. Such collaboration candemystify AI technologies and promote peer-to-peer learning. For instance, entrepreneurshave leveraged local networks to discover new AI use cases and overcome barriers tosustained use .
d. Ensure Ethical and Inclusive AI PracticesDevelop guidelines and frameworks to ensure that AI implementation is ethical, transparent,
and inclusive. This includes addressing potential biases in AI algorithms and ensuring that AItools do not disproportionately disadvantage certain groups. The White House’s executiveorder on AI emphasizes the need for safeguards to improve the security of AI developmentand usage.
4. ConclusionBy implementing these strategies, the AI Action Plan can empower small businesses to
harness AI effectively, thereby enhancing their resilience against uncertainty and resourcelimitations. Two Rivers AI Consulting is committed to supporting these efforts and is preparedto collaborate with stakeholders to advance AI accessibility and education for smallbusinesses.
We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this important initiative and look forward to the
positive impact it will have on the small business community.
