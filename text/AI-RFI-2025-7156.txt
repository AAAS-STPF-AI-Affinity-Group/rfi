General Comment
Proper protection for the intellectual properties of all is a m ust when developing any further AI. Input of anyones' or entities' works m ust
be done through explicit opt-in consent to ensure fairness to creative sector entities. As is, corporate enitities seek to use artists' and
authors' works with as little consent as they can get away with.They are, in essence, glorified plagiarism  m achines, overhyped and stealing
from  the Am erican public. It is a bubble that will pop.It is not worth investing in.
