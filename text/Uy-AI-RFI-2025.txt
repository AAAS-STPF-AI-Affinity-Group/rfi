Louise Uy, 
Nobody is buying the AI Bulls^&*. Nobody wants to see their labor, their copyrights, their IPs 
taken and exploited by hacks who don't want to pay the creative labor force. The only ones who 
want this are those trying desperately to recou p their millions of gambled money just like nfts. 
If your businesses can't grow without exploitative, rampant disregard of trade laws it deserves to 
lose money and shutdown. And I have no faith in the current president with a lifetime record of 
failed bus inesses and  a reputation of stiffing his employers and contractors being an obvious 
puppet lackey to the civilian billionaire who bought his way into the white hous e. That speaks 
volumes about their character and businesnuts.
