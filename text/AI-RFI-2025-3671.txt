General Comment
AI steals from  m y livelihood as a hardworking artist. Supporting real artists supports our econom y!
People will give up on creativity if they get the easy way out. We will lose our position as a culture giant if this happens.
Having challenges encourages creativity! AI takes the challenge out of this and regurgitates the sam e things we've seen for decades.
