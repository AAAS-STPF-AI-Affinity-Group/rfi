General Comment
The use of AI is disastrous in m ost fields. In art and creative works, it steals from  established artists and m usicians to create. In academ ia,
it has no capacity to fact-check and fabricates claim s and ideas. On top of all of that, the technology required to run these system s does
im m ense econom ic harm  and draws from  electrical grids that are already suffering from  overuse due to crypto technologies. 
Neither the inputs nor the results suggest that AI is a useful technology. Much like NFTs, this is a fad technology that will be abandoned
soon. The US should NOT seek to invest in it.
