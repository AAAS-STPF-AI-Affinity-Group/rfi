General Comment
AI pulling from  any copyrighted art is still blatant copyright infringem ent. If you take the tim e to com pare AI pieces to art from  real artists,
you can see the details and things that it steals. Its not creating anything new, its just shredding existing pictures and taping the pieces
together into a new picture. You can even tell the AI to specifically copy an artists style, and it will SPECIFICALLY steal from  them . It
doesn’t “know” their techniques, its not a fan who’s studied their favorite artist, its not som eone attem pting to recreate a m aster’s style. It
doesn’t know the first thing about how they CREATE, nor does it care. Its just rehashing existing pieces, and while you can argue thats
“how inspiration works”, at least people can actually feel and be inspired, at least they can feel a passion, and strive to be great, be like
their heroes or role m odels. AI has its place, has its uses, but is NOT ok that it has the right to sim ply ignore copyright infringem ent.
Anyone can AI together a picture, then trace it, copy it, any num ber of m ethods to then claim  that “they m ade it”. Not even slightly, not if
its a copy of an AI artwork thats just stealing from  artists.
