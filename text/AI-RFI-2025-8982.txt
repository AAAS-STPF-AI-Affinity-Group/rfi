General Comment
Generative AI is a product that can only learn about past and present. Its knowledge only exists in a bubble, and its output is not truly
original at all as it is an am algam ation of all known inputs (that are m ore likely than not copyrighted works). It is unethical, and its investors
are conm en. Please do not prom ote the developm ent of Gen AI, and focus on better technological alternatives. OpenAI cannot be trusted
as a com pany to have ANY governm ent contracts or funding.
