General Comment
Allowing OpenAI to use any im age without perm ission of the IP holders is going to lead to nonstop theft and the destruction of design
industries. The econom y is already about to collapse and destroying another industry for the sake of the stagnating tech industry (i highly
recom m end watching/listening to som e of Adam  Conover's Factually podcast episodes on AI and how it can't even do that m uch at this
point and people are basically lying to investors about how advanced the tech is).
Letting Open AI and other com panies train their program s on any im age they get is throwing copyright law out the window and I fully
expect com panies like Disney to bring down the ham m er fighting these decisions.
