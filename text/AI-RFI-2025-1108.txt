“Keeping America First in AI Through Openness, Innovation, and 
Unstoppable Enterprise”  
The United States must solidify its global AI leadership by unleashing 
free enterprise, open collaboration, and American ingenuity —rather than 
stifling innovation with excessive controls.  
Building on our legacy from the transistor to the internet, these 
recommendations ensure America remains first in AI through decentralized 
development, open -source contributions, and allied cooperation.  
1. Promote a Robust, Open AI Ecosystem
Encourage Open Source & Collaborative Innovation  
-Federal Grant Prioritization: Direct sizable R&D grants toward open -
source AI initiatives. These projects allow entrepreneurs, small
businesses, and academic researchers to rapidly refine and build upon
each other’s work.
-Safe Harbor & Legal Clarity: Create a clear safe harbor for model
developers who share weights, code, and datasets in good faith under open
licenses. Liability concerns surrounding open -source contributions must
be minimized to spur a healthy ecosystem of innovation.
-Preempt State Legislation: Pass a minimal, clear, actionable AI
framework bill that preempts the impossible to comply with patchwork of
state legislation that is strangling AI development in America and
creating uncertainty for our builders and innovators.
2. Safeguard the Right to Learn and Support Fair Use
-Fair Use and Fair Learning Doctrine: Just as we don’t pay a pro athlete
because we learn to throw a football from watching them on TV, AI should
be allowed to train on public data without extortionate fees. Confirm
that training on existing media —be it text, images, or videos —remains a
protected form of learning, just as it is for human beings.
-Prevent Price -Gouging: If licensing does occur, it must not exceed the
normal cost, (if a book costs $10, it costs $10 for AI with no new,
extortionate licensing fees tacked on).
3. Encourage Mutual Access Among Allies
-Reciprocal Training Permissions: Incentivize proprietary model makers
in the United States and allied nations to allow training on the outputs
of their closed models, facilitating cross -innovation.
4. Embrace Foreign Open -Source Contributions
-No Restrictions on Foreign Open Source: Avoid limiting access to openly
released models from any source —including Chinese research groups —if the
code and weights are freely and legitimately available. American


developers should be able to refine, align, and adapt such models to 
uphold and embed American values.  
5. Ensure American Technological Sovereignty in AI
Strengthen Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing  
-Tax Incentives & Grants: Extend generous tax breaks and direct
incentives to companies building semiconductor fabs on American soil.
This ensures a stable domestic supply of critical AI hardware, protecting
us from overseas disruptions.
-Risk Mitigation: Recognize the geopolitical risks surrounding Taiwan.
The United States must have robust alternative sources of chips if a
regional conflict disrupts supply chains.
7. Encourage Domestic Rare Earth Extraction
-Priority Mining & Resource Exploration: Offer financial credits and
streamlined permitting for teams that discover and exploit new U.S. based
rare earth mineral deposits, reducing dependence on overseas suppliers —
especially those in adversarial nations.
8. Prioritize Common -Sense Intellectual Property Protections
Empower AI Developers and Human Creators  
-Human-in-the-Loop Copyright: Maintain that AI -generated works with
meaningful human input are eligible for copyright. This recognizes both
the creative contribution of individuals and the new possibilities AI
unlocks.
9. Maintain Light -Touch Regulation While Upholding American Values
Reject Overreaching AI ‘Alignment’ Mandates  
-Protect Innovation Freedoms: While businesses and research groups
naturally evolve best practices for “responsible AI,” the federal
government must not shackle innovators with sweeping requirements or top -
down alignment frameworks that hamper freedom of thought or expression.
-Promote Transparency Through Choice: Rather than forcing uniform
compliance, incentivize companies to publish easy -to-understand
documentation on model function and limitations. This fosters user trust
without crushing creativity.
10. Champion the American Approach to AI
-Decentralized, Not Centralized: Encourage solutions to emergent AI
risks and challenges through market -driven best practices, academic
research, and voluntary industry standards.
-Voluntary Consortiums: Government, industry, and academic stakeholders
can collaborate in voluntary consortiums to create shared norms —


especially around security and reliability —without mandating heavy -handed 
oversight.  
Keep America First with Freedom and Openness  
With open collaboration, fair use, and minimal regulatory burdens, the AI 
Action Plan ensures America stays first in AI now and in the future.
