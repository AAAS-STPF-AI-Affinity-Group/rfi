General Comment
AI training has been com pletely unscrupulous and harm ful since day one. Never has any technology gobbled up data on such a wide and
public scale. Without a way to opt out of this, it has becom e a m eans to undercut hardworking freelancers, robbing them  of livelihoods.
Money rem ains in the hands of large corporations without any way to even credit the sources for exposure, an already lowly m ove. This
isn't even to m ention the legal can of worm s that can lead to the explosion of revenge porn, or any generations that use som eone's likeness
without their consent. Silicon Valley's m otto of m ove fast and break things should be reined in when it com es to the privacy and work of
hundreds of m illions of people. Make data training opt in, or m ake the product free and stop profiting from  blatant theft.
