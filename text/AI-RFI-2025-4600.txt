General Comment
A technology that requires the rem oval of federal law to break even on its operating costs, m uch less becom e profitable, should be cause
to reconsider if such a technology is even worth pursuing. Doubly so when it does not take a lawyer to see that when those "burdensom e"
barriers are rem oved, AI com panies them selves will not be protected from  intellectual property theft.
To put it bluntly, this is a m ove that will hurt everyone and benefit no one.
