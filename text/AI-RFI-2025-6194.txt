General Comment
Priority policy actions should include m easures for protecting the environm ent, protecting individual persons' copyrighted m aterial and
preventing use and/or profit of their m aterial without perm ission, and prevention of censorship and disinform ation in m edia. Currently,
corporate generative AI is a threat to all of these things. Policy should enforce these protections.
