General Comment
AI is a scam , built on plagiarism  and theft from  creators without their consent or cooperation. It is also a dead end, as m ultiple AI groups
have adm itted that there is not enough data available to train their m odels beyond what they are already capable of. The burdensom e
governm ent relations that the Trum p adm inistration seeks to rem ove are copyright protections that have existed for a century or m ore. If
AI is not able to exist without violating current US law, it will never be able to provide an actual return on investm ent, and should not be
supported through artificial governm ent spending. The m arket has spoken, and it can find no actual use for AI.
In no way should it protected and supported by governm ent intervention when it cannot provide a justification for its existence beyond
fleecing the Am erican public to m ake a sm all cohort of Silicon Valley VCs m oney. AI is a scam  and should not hold a place in the future
of the United States.
