General Comment
Copyright was created so that ideas can be easily created and shared. AI is a strange area to be in because, while developed by hum ans,
Artificial Intelligence is not. From  what I have read, our current m odel of AI is built on pattern recognition and is able to generate words
and ideas based on m odels it has been given for analysis. 
Creators, Authors, Speakers, Artists should have the final say if they want their works to be used to train AI and have it create works
sim ilar to what they have created. Taking away that choice hurts the sm all businesses of Am erica. It com pletely ignores the very reason
copyright law was created in the first place. Instead, this allows large corporations to run with little to no com petition. Like a m onopoly.
Which should be illegal (or was the last tim e I checked). It allows large corporations to use m aterials they would have had to pay hard-
working Am ericans for the right to use.
It also creates a dangerous precedent towards censorship. Those in charge of these AI generators can decide which works to analyze,
which m eans som e voices are going to be ignored and lost to tim e. There should rem ain a standard of protection for created works in the
US that rem ains untouched and unstained by generative AI until better uses have been m ore thoroughly thought out.
