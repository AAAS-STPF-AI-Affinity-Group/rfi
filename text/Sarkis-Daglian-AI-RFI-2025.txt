Good Afternoon,
On behalf of the University of California, Irvine, I am submitting our comments and insights
regarding the development of a comprehensive artificial intelligence action plan. Weappreciate the opportunity afforded by the Trump administration to contribute to the dialogueon this vital innovation and growth sector, and we look forward to collaborating on strategiesthat ensure America remains at the forefront of AI research and development.
We have identified several strategic priorities that we believe are essential for sustaining theUnited States’ long-term leadership position in artificial intelligence innovation:
AI Research & Innovation Funding
Expand federal AI grant funding to accelerate industry disruption and startup growth
Increase NSF, DOE, and DARPA AI research grants to fund breakthrough AIinnovations that drive new business creation and industrial transformation.
Prioritize funding for applied AI research in healthcare, manufacturing, energy,and automation to accelerate commercialization.
Authorize federal AI infrastructure funds for on-premises and cloud-based AI computeleasing
Modify NSF and DOE funding rules to allow universities, startups, and researchlabs to lease AI compute power from private cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud,Microsoft Azure).
Establish a national AI compute marketplace, where institutions can accesssubsidized cloud-based GPUs and TPUs to reduce entry barriers for AI research.
Provide grant program funding for universities to acquire, deploy, and maintainon-premises GPUs and other necessary hardware capable of locally hosting LLMsand AIs for research purposes
Develop regional AI supercomputing hubs for universities and industry collaboration
Provide federal matching funds to create regional AI high-performance computing(HPC) centers that serve multiple universities, research institutions, and AIstartups.
Ensure these hubs have direct partnerships with private cloud and semiconductor


firms to offer state-of-the-art AI infrastructure.
Expand private AI R&D partnerships through industry-funded university research labs
Offer federal R&D tax credits to corporations funding university-led AI research,
allowing them to retain some commercial rights to resulting IP.
Encourage the creation of university AI innovation districts, where academia andindustry collaborate without unnecessary regulatory barriers.
AI Education & Workforce Development
Mandate AI education in K-12 and higher education curricula
Require AI literacy programs in K-12 education, focusing on prompt engineering,ethical use, and applications for research and knowledge acquisition.
Fund university AI degree programs and certification tracks that emphasize AIethics, engineering, and security to build a competitive AI workforce.
Expand corporate-sponsored AI research clusters in universities
Create federal tax incentives for corporations that sponsor high-performance AIresearch labs within universities.
Establish AI professorship endowments, where private-sector sponsorships fundfaculty chairs specializing in AI model development and application.
Incentivize AI adoption in university administration to reduce costs and increaseefficiency
Provide federal performance-based grants to universities that implement AI-driven administrative automation, cutting waste in student services, budgeting,and HR operations.
Encourage public-private AI partnerships to develop cost-effective AI tools forhigher education management.
AI Model Transparency, Explainability, and Open-Source Development
Establish AI explainability and transparency standards for high-impact sectors
Require financial, healthcare, and government AI systems to meet baselineinterpretability benchmarks, ensuring clear documentation and decision-makingtransparency.
Create a self-regulated AI assurance program, where companies can opt intothird-party model audits without government-imposed restrictions.
Promote open-source AI model development for cost efficiency and innovation
Incentivize private-sector open-source AI contributions by offering R&D tax breaksfor companies that release non-proprietary AI models.
Fund university-led open-source AI frameworks, enabling researchers to buildupon existing open-source AI models while maintaining U.S. leadership in AIsafety and ethics.


Thank you for considering our recommendations. We remain committed to fostering
collaboration and innovation to ensure the United States continues to lead in artificialintelligence research and development. Should you require further information or wish todiscuss these proposals in greater detail, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Respectfully,
Sarkis Daglian
