General Comment
I do not believe that AI has any m ajor benefits to the future of Am erica. In its current form , it is only useful for highly-m echanical tasks that
would already be handled m ostly by com puters as-is. The plans that the tech industry has for AI are laughably shortsighted at best, and
the White House choosing to even entertain the idea of it is already a bad sign.
