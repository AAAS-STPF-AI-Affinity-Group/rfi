Hello,
As an expert in machine learning and a US citizen you should not allow AI companies to violate copyright of

It will devalue the creation of new works, and cripple our ability to better AI, which depends heavily on new works.________________________________All e-mails to and from this account are for NITRD official use only and subject to certain disclosure requirements.
