“It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global dominance in 
order to promote human ﬂourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security”
-President Donald J. Trump, Executive Order 14179, January 23, 2025
Recogni respectfully submits the following policy recommendations for consideration as the 
OBice of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) develops a comprehensive Artiﬁcial Intelligence 
(AI) Action Plan to sustain and enhance American leadership in AI.  
1.AI Performance Measurement and Export Controls
Current export controls, focused solely on single -device performance metrics (e.g., MacTOPS per 
integrated circuit), are inadequate given rapid annual advancements in silicon technology and the 
capability to network multiple ICs into supercomputers. Policy frameworks must adopt holistic 
performance metrics, considering both individual device capabilities and their aggregate 
performance in networked conﬁgurations.  
2.Customer Identiﬁcation (KYC) and Usage Audits
The global reach of cloud providers facilitates broad access to powerful AI computing resources. 
To mitigate associated risks, regulatory frameworks should require:  
•Comprehensive Know -Your -Customer (KYC) protocols.
•Continuous monitoring of AI usage patterns and originating countries.
•Aggregated compute usage limits.
•Regular and transparent reporting to regulatory bodies, independent of physical
infrastructure location.
3.DiOerentiating AI Training from AI Inference Systems


 
 
 2 Clear policy diBerentiation is essential between dual -purpose AI systems (capable of both training 
and inference) and dedicated inference -only systems. Dual -purpose systems necessitate 
stringent controls to prevent unauthorized AI model proliferation, whe reas inference -only 
systems, critical for wide -scale AI adoption, require appropriately balanced regulatory frameworks 
promoting secure and expansive deployment , with potentially fewer restrictions based on risk 
proﬁle . 
 
4.Managing Dual -Use Risks of AI Inference Systems  
 
AI inference silicon and systems, versatile across applications such as robotics, drones, industrial 
automation, military systems, surveillance, and critical infrastructure monitoring, pose signiﬁcant 
dual -use risks. Policymakers should establish stringen t reporting, tracking, and auditing 
obligations for manufacturers, mandating detailed customer disclosures and end -use assurances 
to minimize the risk of misuse.  
 
5.Disposal and Secondary Market Control of AI Silicon  
 
Despite common perceptions, depreciated AI systems (typically 3 -5 years old) remain capable for 
AI model development, particularly when clustered. Regulatory policies must require secure 
disposal and destruction procedures for retired AI silicon and prohibit their uncontrolled resale on 
secondary markets to unauthorized entities.  
 
Conclusion  
 
Maintaining American leadership in AI demands vigilant and adaptive regulatory frameworks that 
balance innovation and security. Recogni remains committed to supporting OSTP’s eBorts and 
welcomes further dialogue to reﬁne these critical policy areas.  
 
 
Respectfully ,
