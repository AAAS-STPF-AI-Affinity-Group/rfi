General Comment
I speak as an artist in the illustrative works, com m enting on the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan that seeks to provide OpenAI with the
ability to train their LLMs (Large Language Models) on copyrighted m aterials (or rather pieces of art) regardless of the copyright holders'
consent.
I am  writing this to ask for the US governm ent to drop this plan. OpenAI's business is built on the theft of the creative work of countless
artists and to give them  the right to steal in im punity would only be disastrous for these sam e artists who already face great hardships.The
generative AI business in general is a speculative bubble rife with overhype, data security concerns and false prom ises on top of fleecing
the am erican public's eyes. Instead, com panies like OpenAI should be obligated to com pensate artists for the theft of their work while
m aking sure the im ages produced by LLMs cannot be copyrighted m aterials them selves (it'd be hypocritical and dangerous that GenAI
com panies can steal copyrighted artworks while using copyright to protect their businesses).
GenAI has no place in the US governm ent and society. Thus I respectfully say that this plan m ust be abandonned.
