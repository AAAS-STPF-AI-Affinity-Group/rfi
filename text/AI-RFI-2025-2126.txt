General Comment
The current AI boom  is the result of tech grifters doing everything in their power to screw over the Am erican people. To to com pletely
crash every creative and artistic industry with technology that is at present entirely unethical in its creation and developm ent. 
Any legislation that em powers the use of AI will only help lead this country to ruin.
Allowing AI work to be copyrighted and ignore copyrights for its training will only destroy copyright law and the livelyhoods of not only
individuals and sm all businesses but larger com panies as well such as Disney for exam ple.
Once m ore when hum an m ade art becom es entirely unprofitable AI will have less and less to train on. Once the only thing it can be fed is
m ore AI art it will poison its own well and it will also devolve into worthlessness.
AI is nothing m ore than a fools errand and it should be discarded as such. It is cancer on not only the various art industries but on the
econom y as a whole.
