General Comment
Artificial intelligence poses a threat to the livelihoods of creators in the United States, and to the creative intelligence and com petence of
the country's citizenry. AI profits from  the theft of copyrighted works and negatively im pacts the ability of creative people to m ake even a
basic living. As a writer, I find AI to do m ore harm  than good, and m y own incom e has been effected. AI is being developed too quickly,
without reasonable forethought to necessary guardrails (and legal recourse for those harm ed) going forward. It is a grave m istake to
continue pushing forward with AI in the absence of strict regulation and close m onitoring, as well as the absence of legislation to protect
work created by actual hum an beings.
