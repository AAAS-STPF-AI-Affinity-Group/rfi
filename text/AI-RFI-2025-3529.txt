General Comment
I believe the strength and value of AI technologies has been grossly m isrepresented in the com m on m edia and m arketplace reporting that
will have a dire "bubble" effect as stakeholders realize the lim ited value of this technology in m ass applications for the daily lives of the
average Am erican. Quite frankly I don't believe this technology holds a place in the future of the US if the dom inant philosophy is to
replace, undercut, or undervalue the labor and livelihood of our working class and intellectual and creative laborers. The technology can
only keep growing right now by stealing from  m y livelihood as an artist and quite sim ply cannot create anything useful without further
scraping and robbery-scrapping ad infinitum . I join countless other Am ericans in proclaim ing: AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of
the Am erican public.
