General Comment
As an artist that is currently getting m y bachellors degree in Illustration and already has a degree in Graphic Design I vehem ently oppose
this decision. Because it will m ake getting a job m ore difficult for m e and other artists. It totally replaces the skilled work of people and
rem oves the core of art as a representation of the hum an experience.
