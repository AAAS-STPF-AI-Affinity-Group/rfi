General Comment
I can only assum e the 'unnecessarily burdensom e requirem ents' that are ham pering private sector AI are actually copyright infringem ents.
If their innovation cannot be accom plished without theft of intellectual property, then it is not worth accom plishing. Legalizing theft for the
furtherance of som ething that is a drain on resources while not even m anaging to be profitable is both em barrassing and m orally repugnant.
