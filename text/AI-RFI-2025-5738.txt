General Comment
I'm  old enough to rem em ber when $150,000 per willful copyright infringem ent was used to sue tweens and grandm as who downloaded
songs on Napster to the tune of trillions of dollars. AI com panies are stealing at orders of m agnitude higher than that. AI com panies cannot
be given cart blanche to steal the copyright of every person and com pany just because they are big.
