BioMADE RFI on AI for Bioindustrial Processes - Final


1 BioMADE Response to Request for Information on the Development of an 
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
The following response is from BioMADE and is being submitted by  Andrew Eichenbaum, Sr. 
Director of Data Science at BioMADE, and Chris Dunlap, Director of Information Systems & 
Security at BioMADE. 
This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-
proprietary or conﬁdential information. Document contents may be reused by the

BioMADE is a non-proﬁt Manufacturing Innovation Institute (MII) catalyzed by the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD). By supporting the development of biomanufacturing 
technologies, BioMADE and its network of over 300 members across 38 states are 
strengthening American competitiveness, creating a more resilient supply chain, re-shoring 
manufacturing jobs, and producing new bio-based products from American-grown 
feedstocks. BioMADE is also building a globally competitive Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce to ensure American workers are prepared 
and ready to ﬁll new jobs within this rapidly growing industry.  
************************************************************************************* 
AI is critical to continued U.S. leadership in all manufacturing sectors. This includes 
bioindustrial manufacturing, which uses biological systems such as microbes (e.g., 
bacteria, yeast, and algae) to create new materials or secure alternatives to existing 
materials. BioMADE advances biomanufacturing technologies from early development in 
the laboratory through pilot scale-up to commercialization, with a focus on Manufacturing 
Readiness Levels (MRLs) 4-7. Data is a core component of this scale-up process, and AI will 
play a critical role in accelerating the commercialization of chemicals and materials made 
from biology. With our member companies and organizations, BioMADE is currently 
developing a Digital Backbone that will facilitate the collection, analysis, and sharing of 
bioindustrial data to rapidly grow the use of AI in this sector. 
AI could have a transformative impact across all stages of bioindustrial manufacturing. Early 
in development, AI can facilitate the discovery and creation of microbes that are used for 
bioindustrial manufacturing, thereby enabling higher yields or lower costs of production. AI 
can also be used to automatically manage and optimize bioindustrial processes. For 
example, by analyzing water and energy usage, raw material consumption, and 
microorganism growth conditions, AI can help increase eƯiciency and reduce costs. In 
addition, AI-based optimization of supply chains, including through materiel demand 
forecasting, inventory management, and disruption predictions, will enable companies to 
more eƯiciently and robustly source the inputs they need to manufacture a range of 
bioproducts. 


2 The major barrier to fully realizing these and other beneﬁts of AI is a lack of data systems and 
standards that would enable the large-scale collection, analysis, and sharing of bioindustrial 
datasets. Making bioindustrial datasets truly AI ready will require four primary activities: 
1. Development of a set of centrally created, managed, and maintained data systems
such that bio-data, bio-analytics, and bio-process deﬁnitions, can be stored in a
secure but easily shareable platform.
2. Creation of a set of standards for bio-data and bio-process management and tracking
so that scientists and engineers across the U.S. can “speak the same language” and
easily compare their data and processes.
3. Deﬁnition of a bio-data governance and security policy that can maximize ecosystem
learning while protecting U.S. data from foreign adversaries.
4. A dedicated and focused education program around the collection, management,
and analysis of data with speciﬁc courses focused on using AI in bioindustrial
manufacturing.
These recommendations are supported by recent reports from the National Security 
Commission on Emerging Biotechnology1 and National Academies2. 
1-2. Develop Data Systems and Standards
Biodata platform standards and best practices for data production and data storage will play 
a critical role in enabling the use of AI in bioindustrial manufacturing. Currently, there are a 
wide range of bioindustrial data formats and storage approaches. As a result, researchers 
can only leverage small, local datasets to inform their technology development. With the 
standardization of biodata formats for storage, scientists will be able to access, use, and 
understand the vast amounts of already generated data within the domestic 
biomanufacturing ecosystem. Coupled with a centralized, standardized, and secure data 
store, these standards will facilitate data sharing between industry, academic, and 
government partners and accelerate scale-up of products from the lab bench to 
commercialization. As the global leader in AI and biomanufacturing, the U.S. is well 
positioned to develop data standards and approaches that will be adopted worldwide.  
3.Deﬁne Governance and Security Policies
All central data stores, standards, and sharing approaches must be created with an eye to 
governance and data security.  Platforms should take a day-one approach to cyber security 
and incorporate traceability into their governance approaches to prevent and mitigate 1 National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology. 2023. National Security Commission on

3 attempts from adversaries to gain access to innovative technologies. AI-driven security tools 
for threat detection and anomaly analysis are essential to protect research, intellectual 
property, and critical infrastructure from cyber threats and biosecurity risks. U.S. leadership 
in AI – and in the software and data systems components necessary for the use of AI – will 
be critical to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign AI models that carry data privacy risks, risks 
of manipulation, and potential strategic vulnerabilities.  
4.Create Education Programs
Education will be critical to enable the bioindustrial manufacturing workforce to incorporate 
AI into activities such as data collection, management, and analysis. Professional 
development programs will enable the current workforce to leverage AI in their existing 
manufacturing operations, including predictive maintenance, quality control, and workﬂow 
optimization. Programs should also be developed at the community college and university 
levels to train the next generation of technologists, scientists, and engineers. These 
programs should include real-world AI projects that apply theoretical concepts to practical 
scenarios, provide industry certiﬁcations, and job placement support. Instructors should be 
trained in the latest industry practices, including through externships that allow educators 
to gain hands-on experience in industrial settings and bring new skills back to the classroom. 
Sustained engagement with industry is important for collaborative curriculum development; 
provision or access to latest tools, technologies, or software used in the industry; and 
providing hands on learning opportunities for students and teachers.
