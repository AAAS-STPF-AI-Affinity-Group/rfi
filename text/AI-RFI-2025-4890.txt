General Comment
Allowing AI to train on copyrighted m aterial will devastate the Am erican creative sector, including m yself and m any others like m e. I
strongly oppose the investm ent into such untested technology that has not yet proven its usefulness for the Am erican public or the
Am erican governm ent.
