General Comment
The generative technology should be BANNED, not further developed, the levels of abuse and harm  to people's likelihoods, the
environm ent, and to the law it does are beyond astronom ical, it's already m aking extortions and scam s even worse than ever before, and
the usage of this tech at any capacity is only atrophying people's basic ability of problem  solving, decision m aking, and only encouraging an
even m ore selfish, greedy, and apathetic attitude am ong those who engage with it, which is especially harm ful to younger ages and future
generations, everything this generative tech does is BAD, and anyone pushing it and scrapping data to fuel it should be treated as a
crim inal, especially because it's also being used for very harm ful stuff like the fabrication of pornography, including child pornography,
which the tech has TONS of inside its database, and needs to operate and deliver results the average consum er m ay consider rem otely
decent
Copyright laws are there for a reason, and enabling com panies to take copyrighted works for genAI is like allowing robbers to break
locks and get into people's houses, let alone that also will create a m onstrous floodgate that will oversaturate and collapse m arkets far and
wide, it's already doing it in som e fields, like I said, everything this tech does is BAD, tech com panies pushing this request should get
PUNISHED and charged for all the harm  this tech's already doing to everything and everyone
