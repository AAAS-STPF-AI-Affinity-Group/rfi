General Comment
Copywrite law is clear and as a creator LLMs like the ones OpenAI uses violate m y rights of ownership over m y own creations. It's
som ething that MUST be observed as there are too m any ways for it to be abused. Im agine a sm all com pany generating a princess-style
im age for prom otion of an adult brand and the AI system  spits out som ething that looks straight out of Disney. Don't they have a right to
protect their brand and their work from  not only copycats, but from  association with various products. Consent MUST be obtained from
the original creators before anything can be added to a training m odel in order for capitalism  to still flourish.
