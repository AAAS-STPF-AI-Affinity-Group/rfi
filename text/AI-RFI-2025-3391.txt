General Comment
As a freelance artist, allowing AI free use to the work of individuals like m yself would be underm ining our livelihood. Generative AI
subsists and profits on theft on a m assive scale, and are currently asking for perm ission to continue that freely. I do not believe generative
AI holds a place in the future of the United States, and I ask that Congress does not cow to the whim s of OpenAI or other such
com panies.
