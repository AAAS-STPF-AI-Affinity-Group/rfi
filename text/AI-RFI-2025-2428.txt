General Comment
AI in its current state is theft. There is no argum ent about it. It takes inform ation, im ages, and writings from  real people, jum bles it all
together, and produces som ething it claim s that it created itself. When in reality you’re seeing a collage of people’s work that they weren’t
paid for and that they don’t even realize has been used to program  this AI. It doesn’t “learn” anything that it hasn’t stolen from  a real
person. If AI com panies were to ask perm ission to use people’s work to program  their AI, then that would be fine. But instead, they take
what they want without asking and play the victim s when they get confronted with their actions. If your business can’t operate without
theft, then your business shouldn’t exist at all! And the governm ent shouldn’t be allowing these com panies to persist or even have any part
in the governm ent!
