General Comment
The further expansion of AI in the sphere of the USA will only lead to m ore confusion, chaos, and m isinform ation being spread thanks
this. It cannot be allowed to go through. There are too m any issues that can occur due to AI being used inappropriately, and thereâ€™s not
enough m oderation to deal with the consequences if things get out of hand.
