At this time  it is a waste of Federal funds to develop an AI action plan and I would prefer details 
on why “dominance” is needed in this endeavor if all current Open AI is public and not federally 
regulated. What concerns me is the motivation or reason behind this com ment made in a recent 
White House article. “ The AI Action Plan will define priority policy actions to enhance 
America’s position as an AI powerhouse and prevent unnecessarily burdensome requirements 
from hindering private sector innovation. With the right  governmental policies, continued U.S. 
AI leadership will promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national 
security.” I believe those so called burdensome requirements will better -protect United Stated 
citizens and businesses not hinder t he development of AI. I would like more information on who 
would benefit the most from this action plan.
