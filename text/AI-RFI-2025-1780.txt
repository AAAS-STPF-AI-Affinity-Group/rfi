General Comment
Unchecked ai being allowed to decim ate the laws of copyright can only serve to destroy any sense of ownership in this country. If
corporations are allowed exem ption sim ply because they are corporations and not individuals, this would be the largest tell that the current
adm inistration does not care for the people and instead only cares about the profits if the com panies that would benefit from  the allowance
to skirt the laws put in place to protect creators. Like wise, I would assum e should corporations be allowed to do so they will still dem and
their own copyright protections. Further dam aging the lively hoods of creatives. We are already in a catastrophic unem ploym ent. Pushing
m ore people into unem ploym ent without having available jobs for them  to take would lead to m assive unem ploym ent.
Gen Ai gives no benefit to hum anity other than to usurp those that have worked their lives to produce and cast them  aside without any
com pensation. It m akes hum ans less com petent as they have been given another crutch that allows them  to not have to think and instead
get a m achine to do so for them . This will destroy the m inds of m illions.
