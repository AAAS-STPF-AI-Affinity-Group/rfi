Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF): Robot Recommendations for the AI Action Plan 
The United States of America must lead the world in AI-powered robotics and demonstrate its 
leadership by rapidly integrating robots into the federal workforce to improve efficiency and 
effectiveness of core governmental functions. Specifically, the AI Action Plan should make 
clear that it is the policy of the United States to improve governmental services and citizen 
protection with AI-powered robotics, including in physical security, where it is immediately 
feasible to accelerate the future by leveraging the technology already used in the private 
sector. This can be done now by integrating autonomous security robots (ASRs) into federal 
facilities, critical infrastructure, and public safety operations. 
Key Recommendations for the AI Action Plan 
The U.S. should accelerate AI-powered robotic security innovation by implementing the following policies: 
1.Reduce Federal Security Costs: Show how America will save money with robots.Direct federal agencies to achieve at least a 10% reduction in physical security costs viaU.S.-made security robots saving up to $10 billion a year with this technology  while
creating new American manufacturing jobs.
2.Modernize Federal Security Infrastructure: Integrate advanced robotics into thefederal workforce. Outline a near-term pathway to allow for acceleration of roboticsacross the federal government to improve safety and security.
3.Deploy a National Pilot for ASRs in Critical Federal Operations: Direct DHS, DoD,GSA and VA to implement a multi-agency initiative deploying ASRs in high-riskenvironments such as military bases, airports, and federal buildings.
4.Ensure Robotics Supply Chain Security: Prohibit federal procurement of ASRs orrelated security robotics from adversary nations to mitigate cybersecurity and robotsupply chain vulnerabilities mirroring actions taken with aerial drones.


2 Overview  
The United States stands at a crossroads in public safety, law enforcement and security 
technology. While autonomous systems have already transformed industries globally, the 
federal government continues to depend on high-cost, labor-intensive methods for security. 
Meanwhile, criminal networks and adversaries are increasingly deployi ng AI and autonomous 
tools that outpace traditional defenses. 
The Problem: Federal Security is Costly, Outdated, and Vulnerable 
As technologists assess how to best leverage advanced robotics to solve problems within the 
federal government, physical security stands out as a top category for intervention. Current 
federal security relies on an expensive, inefficient model that struggl es against rapidly evolving 
threats. Specifically: 
•High Cost : The federal government spends up to an estimated $20 billion annually on
security guards across DHS, DoD, VA, GSA, and other agencies. 
•Turnover and Staffing Gaps: Security personnel can face turnover rates as high as
100% - 400% per year, creating inconsistent staffing, risks and training inefficiencies. 
•Modern Threats: Criminal and hostile actors use AI-driven tactics – autonomous
drones and cyber-physical attacks – to bypass traditional security measures. 
•Procurement Roadblocks: Federal rules fail to incentivize or prioritize the adoption of
autonomous solutions, slowing modernization and do not follow basic technology 
development and deployment principles. 
The Solution: Autonomous Security Robots (ASRs) as Force Multipliers  
ASRs are already being deployed across corporate campuses, hospital, and industrial settings 
– showing the future of how robots can team with humans to improve quality of life. They
enhance existing security operations, shorten response times, and deliver continuous 
monitoring free from human limitations at a fraction of the cost of legacy security solutions. 
•Autonomous Threat Detection: Real -time monitoring, anomaly detection, and
automated alerts around facilities of interest. 
•Round -the-clock Coverage : Robots remain on duty with no breaks, fatigue, and
reliability in high-stress environments. 
•85% Cost Savings: While human security averages $65 per hour, ASRs operate for
about $11 per hour. 
•Force Multiplication: When combined with human oversight, ASRs significantly
increase both reach and efficiency, keeping security officers safe. 
•Counter-AI Capabilities: As criminals use AI for illicit activities, ASRs provide a strong
defensive layer against sophisticated threats. 


3 Robot Recommendations for the AI Action Plan 
Few federal agencies have made use of this technology despite nationwide usage in the 
private sector, but it is not an area where we can afford to fall behind. Literally. It is estimated 
that the federal government could save up to $10 billion annually in physical security costs 
through the deployment of robots that are now commercially available. Meanwh ile, foreign 
adversaries are already developing advanced robotics and deploying those technologies to 
advance their national interest. The United States should strive to visibly remain at the 
forefront of this space by finding near-term, practical ways to incorporate our nation’s robotics 
innovations, especially for security and safety. 
The AI Action Plan should accelerate the robot future by:  
1. Modernizing Federal Procurement to Prioritize Autonomous Security
•Calling for AI and autonomous robotics to be included in federal security contracts
(e.g. DHS, DoD, GSA, VA). 
•Directing the creation of performance-based security standards that reward
automation and robotics. 
•Requiring agencies to explore cost-saving options that incorporate ASRs and other
advanced robotics into current infrastructure. 
•Mandating a minimum 10% reduction in physical security costs through U.S. -
manufactured ASRs and related technologies. 
2. Authorizing Autonomous Security in Federally Managed Spaces
•Directing the revision of federal regulations to allow ASRs across military bases,
DHS facilities, infrastructure sites, and other relevant installations.  
•Expanding counter-drone and anti-intrusion policies to account for robotic security
patrols and the prospect of enhanced security from such systems.  
•Granting DHS, DoD, GSA, VA and other agencies, as appropriate, the explicit
authority to deploy ASRs, cutting red tape and regulatory delays.  
3. Establishing a National Autonomous Security Pilot Program
•Instructing DHS, DoD, GSA, and VA to jointly pilot autonomous security solutions in
rapid fashion to demonstrate U.S. robotics leadership and increase security of U.S. 
facilities. 
•Focusing large-scale deployments on key U.S. ports, airports, military installations,
and other locations where technology scale offers high-cost savings and security 
enhancements. 
•Funding dedicated research within relevant agencies to advance applied robotics for
the purposes of improving governmental services and operations. 


4 4. Prohibiting Federal Procurement of Adversary Technologies
•Prohibiting the purchase of autonomous security robots, surveillance systems, and
AI-driven security tools from adversary nations due to national security risks – similar 
to existing standards for aerial drone technology. 
•Establishing a federal supply chain security standard requiring that AI -powered
security robotics used in federal operations be U.S. manufactured to prevent data 
exploitation, intellectual property protection, cyber vulnerabilities, and foreign 
surveillance threats. 
Agency -Specific Applications of Autonomous Security Robots (ASRs)

without increasing overall spending.
4.Scale Nationwide: Expand ASR deployment across all major agencies within  3 years.
By rapidly deploying ASRs, the U.S. will achieve major security and cost-efficiency gains while ensuring the federal government remains at the forefront of AI security innovation – while 
creating new American manufacturing jobs.  This AI Action Plan must prioritize immediate 
adoption  of autonomous security solutions to ensure federal agencies operate more securely, 
efficiently, and intelligently in the  age of AI-driven threats. 
Conclusion: Cementing U.S. Leadership in AI Robotic Security 
It is in the national security interests of the United States of America to move beyond 
theoretical AI discussions and take concrete steps to integrate AI-driven security solutions. The 
AI Action Plan should prioritize the deployment of ASRs to: 
•Enhance national security by hardening federal infrastructure nationwide
•Reduce federal spending saving taxpayers billions
•Establish U.S. leadership in AI-driven robots
A decisive commitment to AI-powered robotics will ensure that America stays ahead of 
emerging security threats while optimizing government operations. 
Make America the Safest Country in the World.
