General Comment
Do not allow this to happen. Stop letting com panies steal our data and work to replace hard working Am ericans who've spent thousands
of hours on perfecting their art. It's despicable you're even considering this and it's a big kick to artists who are already suffering due to
layoffs under Biden.
