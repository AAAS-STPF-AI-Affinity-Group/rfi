General Comment
AI can be advanced in a m anner that isn't infringing on copyright and privacy law. The general public should not be forcibly opted in to
using AI in search engines or content creation. AI program s should be restricted to voluntarily subm itted content and adhere to copyright
law in its training algorithm s. Most artists and content creators do not want their work put into training som ething that m any tout as the
thing that will put all artists out of a job. AI content is not art, and is still in such an experim ental phase that it should not be an authority on
m ajor search engines like Google, Bing, and Brave. AI searches should be elim inated from  the general internet and generative AI features
should rem ain opt-in only.
