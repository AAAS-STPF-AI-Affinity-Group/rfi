General Comment
"AI" is neither artificial nor is it in any way intelligent. It is a plagiarism  m achine that's been secretly fed m illions of copyrighted works from
HUMAN BEINGS. It lack *any* understanding of hum an em otions or interests or fears or dream s. It has zero understanding of love or
loss or fear or longing. It generates nothing of any genuine resonance with any hum an soul.
It CAN do great things in analyzing huge datasets and finding patterns, but it has NO place in creating anything like art or literature our
m usic or stories or any other expression of hum an creativity.
HUMAN creators m ust be protected from  the strip-m ining of their work by faceless corporations hell-bent on destroying this aspect of
our existence.
Lim it AI to controlled use as an analytical tool, while restricting its use for generating "original" content (via theft and plagiarism ).
