General Comment
I believe this is potentially the quickest way to destroy all of our culture. if AI is allowed to proceed this way, anything original that's been
or will be created can just be fed to it, only dum ping out at the very best half baked nightm ares of what once were creative ideas, and the
original people who m ade them  won't have a say. AI shouldn't be a substitute for the hard effort hum ans want to do to m ake Am erica a
better place, as for now, AI can't and shouldn't replace things that com e from  souley the hum an spirit. It's just not possible. It m ight seem
possible if you give AI enough data, enough tim e, and enough resources, but in the end you'll never be able to achieve what hum ans have
been doing, even if you say you can. So how about instead of allowing an exception that could m ake Am erica a lot m essier than it began
with in AI, how about we keep these valued restrictions that are in place for a very long tim e, and a very good reason.
