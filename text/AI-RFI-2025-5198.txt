General Comment
I subm it these points of opposition to the executive order by President Trum p:
-I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US or any nation that prides itself on ingenuity, creativity and resourcefulness.
-AI steals from  m y livelihood as an citizen, film m aker, m edia tech and profits off of that theft while Iâ€™m  left uncom pensated.
-AI is not a substitute for hum an contributions and will take m any jobs from  hardworking Am ericans.
Thank you for hearing m e out on this critical issue.
