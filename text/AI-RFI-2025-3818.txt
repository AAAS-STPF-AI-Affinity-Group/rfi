General Comment
Please don't go through with this. AI has been destroying the internet, and AI com panies using it to steal the property of others has been
devastating. No-one agreed for these com panies to scrape everything off of the internet, and it's not fair use to take som eone's stuff
without ever asking to use it. Do the right thing and stop this.
