General Comment
Large Language Models ("AI") is fundam entally incapable of generating novel inform ation, and allowing it access to m ore, copyrighted
inform ation will not solve that issue. It is only ever able to reference the I form ation it has in storage. It is also prone to errors in basic
inform ation and m athem atical calculations that would not stop a knowledgeable person for a m om ent. The use of AI sought here is to
attem pt to replace workers by lowering em ploym ent costs; it will only lead to less people working all for less pay and worse outcom es.
