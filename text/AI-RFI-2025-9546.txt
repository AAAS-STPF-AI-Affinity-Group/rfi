General Comment
I do not believe AI has any benefit to the future of Am erica.
After reading through this, I sincerely do not believe that "sustaining and enhancing Am erica's AI dom inance" would successfully prom ote
"hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness, and national security."
Lifting restrictions on AI and im proving its dom inance wouldn't solve the problem s we face in our every day lives, let alone solve what you
"claim " to seek to achieve by doing this.
Som ething like this will put creators and organizations that heavily depend on creative and copyright laws into extrem e danger as well as
their livelihoods.
Consider this m e officially and com pletely opposing this Developm ent of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan as well as sim ilar plans.
