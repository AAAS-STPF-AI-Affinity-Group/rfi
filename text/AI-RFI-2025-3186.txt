General Comment
No Chance in HELL anybody's art, speech, video, or Anything of the sort can just be Taken and then used without perm ission, especially
in such a wildly uncreditable form , to the detrim ent of artists who would happily accept paym ent to do the work any AI Model would do.
Generative AI has a m assive m aterials and copyright cost. If the com panies producing LLM/other generative m odels can't afford those
costs, they are not viable as a service. The governm ent has no good reason to cowtow to random  Techbros spinning cost cutting based in
fraud and theft as "Innovation".
Let People Sue Open AI. They're not exem pt from  copyright law.
