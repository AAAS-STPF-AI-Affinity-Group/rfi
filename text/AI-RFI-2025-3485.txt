General Comment
Just... generative prom pting based on stolen and inaccurate inform ation will not benefit anyone in any field other except the people
exploiting it.
It's a m assive violation of copyright for creators, and will only create errors and hardship for what it'd be used for.
Not to m ention the im m ense resource use that goes to practically nothing and only hurts our planet.
AI is garbage. You know it. I know it.
