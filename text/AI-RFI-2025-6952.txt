General Comment
Hello,
My nam e is Nancy and I am  an Am erican Visual Artist. I strongly oppose carving out special exceptions to copyright laws for corporate
genAI system s. 
Creatives across all m edium s use their hum anity and lived experiences to create com pelling narratives (both written and visual), and that is
som ething a m achine can never replicate. It can never develop its own work without directly stealing from  creatives. Attem pting to
sidestep copyright is not innovation, it is theft.
Please protect artists, and protect copyright.
Thank you,
Nancy
