Hello, 
I am a freelance artist and aspiring small business owner. Generative AI makes this aspiration
harder and harder as potential clients may choose this “cheaper” option over paying for artists’work. The internet was meant to be open-source and democratic and no search engine shouldhave a monopoly over information. When you lose artists, you lose culture and out-of-the-boxthinking that could prove absolutely crucial to a healthy and prosperous future for allAmericans, not just a select few. Please reconsider the direction that you’re following andremember your empathy.
