Request for Information on the 
Development of an Artiﬁcial Intelligence 
(AI) Action Plan 
Response by: Ai.Fish LLC 
CEO - Jimmy Freese 
This document is approved for public dissemination 
Introduction 
Founded in 2019, Ai.Fish is a Hawaii-based startup focused on the application of 
computer vision to commercial ﬁshing and marine conservation. Our multi-national 
distributed team brings together product, artiﬁcial intelligence, and software 
development expertise to craft solutions solving key challenges in the New Blue 
Economy.  
Our mission is to realize the Fishery of the Future. We believe that artiﬁcial intelligence 
technology, speciﬁcally computer vision approaches, are at a point where they are able 
to be applied to support improved ﬁsheries data and sustainability. Commercial ﬁshing, 
like many production industries, has not been a focus for development of user-friendly 
software and the opportunity for AI-assisted ﬁsheries tools is signiﬁcant. 
Our vision for the Fishery of the Future is one where ﬁshermen have the tools they need 
to harvest the right catch sustainably and in compliance with ﬁshery regulations; while 
ﬁshery management and regulators have tools they need to verify compliance and 
inform management decisions. 
Industry Background 
The latest economic data available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) indicates that commercial ﬁshing grosses an annual sales 
revenue of $183 billion USD and employs approximately 1.6 million. However , landing 
1 


volumes decreased 3% and revenues declined 5%, while ﬁshermen face increased costs 
in fuel and increased regulat ory hurdles1. Key challenges include changes in ﬁsh stocks 
associated with over ﬁshing, illegal and unreported ﬁshing, climate change, and ocean 
temperature ﬂuctuations (e.g. ocean surface temperature warming and cooling due  to 
weather phenomena such as El Niño). Sustainable ﬁsheries management in the United 
States requires access to timely  and comprehensive data. Currently data collection 
varies across ﬁsheries and is far from comprehensive. Many environmental  surveys are 
conducted only every few years including some that have been signi ﬁcantly disrupted by 
events such as the CO VID-19 pandemic. A lar ge proportion of ﬁsheries reporting is done 
manually and only pro vided at the end of a trip at the earliest. Fishing trips for highly 
migratory species such as tuna can last for two to three weeks meaning any data ﬁled 
upon the end of the trip is almost a month old at the time of ﬁling. One potential 
opportunity for improv ed data collection  is the use of electronic monitoring (EM). EM 
systems involve a networked installation of cameras that can record ﬁshing activity 
24/7 onto a hard drive aboard the vessel. Some EM systems  include sensors that 
monitor additional data such as vessel speed, gear deployment, and global position 
(GPS). NOAA has implemented 14 programs across the United States that employ 
electronic monitoring to support sustainable ﬁshery management. However, these 
progr ams t o date are limited by signi ﬁcant costs associated with video review , data 
transmission, and data storage2. Further many of these costs are carried by NOAA as 
the opportunity to share them with ﬁsheries is limited due to the slim and shrinking 
proﬁt margins present in the industry. Lastly , many policy  decisions made around 
sustainability and the enforcement of sustainable ﬁshing are made independent of 
ﬁshermen, threatening livelihoods, economic sustainability in coastal communities,  and 
a traditional way of life in some regions.  
The Opportunity 
As with many industries, the opportunity to improve costs, data handling capabilities, 
and the use of human skills in their areas of maximum impact through the 
implementation of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) strategies in commercial ﬁshing is 
signi ﬁcant. However, little private sect or attention  is attracted to this problem and while 
some attention has been focused toward efforts in AI from entities such as NOAA, 
these efforts are far from commercialization. AI has the potential to support 
compliance efforts for sustainable ﬁsheries through reducing data for review;  reducing 
the time review takes; and reducing the data requiring storage. These opportunities also 
represent a key beneﬁt which is the improved timeliness of data suppor ting near

real-time decision-making and timely aggregated data supporting overall ﬁshery 
oversight. AI used onboard vessels thr ough the implementation of low-powered 
computing equipment linked to the EM system has the potential to offer real-time 
insights to vessel captains and crew and implementations like these have the 
opportunity to go beyond compliance to optimize ﬁshery pro ﬁtability while maintaining 
sustainability. For example, real-time data suppor ting bycatch composition analysis in a 
haul could assist a captain to choose a different location and reduce bycatch quantities 
for the next haul.  
 
AI technology capabilities are reaching the ability to support commercial ﬁshing video 
analysis and a tremendous opportunity to r eimagine sustainable ﬁshery management 
and compliance enforcement exists.  
 
However, technology development and implementation is hampered by signi ﬁcant 
barriers from a private sector perspective. These barriers include di ﬃculty accessing 
existing EM data; procurement requir ements restricting the right to intellectual property 
and the pro ﬁtability associated with retaining ownership t o off erings that are not just 
applicable to the American market; di ﬃculty connecting with relevant agency and 
government stakeholders; and sequestering of AI annotations produced by public 
entities from software development in private sector.  
 
Alignment with Administration Priorities 
Our policy recommendations directly support the Trump Administration's goals of 
removing barriers to AI innovation and enhancing American dominance in this critical 
technology: 
 
1. Reducing Regulatory Barriers: Current restrictions on vessel data access and 
intellectual property limitations in government contracts represent unnecessary 
burdens that slow private sector AI innovation. By implementing our recommendation 
for vessel owner data rights and streamlining procurement requirements, the 
administration can immediately unlock private sector innovation without compromising 
oversight. 
 2. Enhancing American AI Dominance: The maritime domain represents a strategic 
opportunity for American technological leadership. By directing federal funding 
speciﬁcally toward commercial ﬁshing AI applications and creating clearer 
3 


communication channels between agencies and the private sector, America can 
establish global leadership in marine AI technologies that will be exportable worldwide. 
3. Promoting Private Sector Solutions: Our recommendations for public release of
NOAA annotations and extended cloud computing support for startups align perfectly
with the administration's emphasis on private sector-led innovation rather than
government-imposed solutions.
4. Reducing Government Overreach: By empowering vessel owners with greater control
over their data, we can shift from a top-down regulatory approach to a collaborative
framework that achieves sustainability goals while respecting private enterprise.
National Security Implications
Marine AI technologies have signi ﬁcant national security implications that extend 
beyond commer cial bene ﬁts: 
1. Reducing Foreign Dependence: The United States currently imports over 70% of its
seafood, creating a strategic vulnerability. AI-enhanced domestic ﬁshing operations can
help reduce this dependence by making American ﬁshing ﬂeets more e ﬃcient and
sustainable.
2. Maritime Domain Awareness: The same AI technologies that monitor ﬁsh species
can be adapted to detect unauthorized vessels, providing enhanced  coastal surveillance
capabilities that complement existing national security infrastructure.
3. Critical Supply Chain Protection: Fishing represents an essential food security
component. AI systems that optimize catch while ensuring sustainability contribute
directly to America's food security and resilience against global supply chain
disruptions.
4. Technology Leadership: Maintaining American leadership in marine AI prevents
strategic competitors like China from dominating this technology sector. Chinese
ﬁshing ﬂeets already operate globally with minimal transparency;  American  AI
leadership can establish the technological standards that promote accountability
worldwide.

5. Dual-Use Technology Development: Innovations in marine computer vision have
applications for naval operations, underwater infrastructure protection, and monitoring
of critical maritime chokepoints—all supporting broader national security objectives
while being developed through commercial applications.
Marine AI Regulatory Sandbox Program 
We recommend establishing a designated "Marine AI Regulatory Sandbox" that would 
allow companies like ours to rapidly test and iterate AI technologies in controlled marine 
environments with temporary exemptions from certain regulatory requirements. This 
would include: 
●Designated testing zones in U.S. waters where AI systems can be deployed with
expedited permitting
●Streamlined approval process for short-term experimental deployments (30-90
days)
●Real-time feedback loop with NOAA and other relevant agencies
●Simpli ﬁed data sharing agreements that protect both private innovation and
public inter ests
●Clear pathways to transition successful technologies from sandbox testing to full
regulatory approval
●Annual reporting on sandbox innovations to identify regulatory barriers that
should be permanently modi ﬁed
The sandbox would allow marine AI companies to demonstrate effectiveness, address 
regulatory concerns in real-time, and signi ﬁcantly accelerate the path from concept to 
market-ready solutions  without compromising environmental protection or sustainable 
ﬁshing practices. 
AI Action Plan - Policy Considerations 
We believe the following policy considerations would support strong development of AI 
capacity supporting sustainable ﬁshing: 
●Vessel owner rights to guide the release of data and footage pertaining to their
vessel. This would allow private companies to work in collaboration with vessel
owners toward mutually beneﬁcial technology development.
●Federal funding directed speci ﬁcally at AI opportunities in commercial ﬁshing

●Clearer lines of communication and community connection between agencies
such as NOAA and private sector as well as vessel owners and operators.
●Public release of NOAA annotations to private sector AI partners to speed
technology advancement
●Longer-term support for cloud-computing and data storage costs for startup
companies. Currently most cloud providers offer some free support in the ﬁrst 12
months. AI development can take years and is more r esour ce intensive than
many other types of software projects. Either supplementary funding or tax
incentives for these entities to offer a larger number of credits or discounted
services over an extended period of time would go a long way to assisting the
vibrancy of the early-stage private sector in this technology.
●Fewer restrictions on business research funding such as Small Business
Innovation Research funds to select foreign expertise. Particularly in high
technology applications such as computer vision, domestic expertise is
sometimes diﬃcult to secure, especially on a startup budget.
●Enhanced training for University students/graduates in computer vision
technologies and other relevant skillsets (e.g. Linux systems, bash, algorithms,
data design etc). Our experience is that many University students require
considerable additional training to maximize their value in an AI company.
