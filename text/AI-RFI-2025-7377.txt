General Comment
Generative AI input/predictions have no use in our hum an society. It does not solve problem s to fix everyday problem s, and the everyday
Am erican is sick of having it ham -fisted into every "sm art" product they own between iPhone and Microsoft Office. Adopting a natural
presidint on funding Generative AI program s does not have a future in corporative Am erica besides stealing art without perm ission from
everyday artists, be it m usical or physical or even artistical, and using those stolen works to create som ething that doesn't understand the
very work it's copying from . This is not a technology worth investing in as long as it regurgitates other people's ideas as it's own.
