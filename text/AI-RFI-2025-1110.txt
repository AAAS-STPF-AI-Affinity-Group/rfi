General Comment
Am ericans have concerns that the entities involved in AI developm ent have no guiderails to follow. AI has the ability to be a boon to
Mankind, or it' worst enem y. I encourage our leaders to keep the tech side on a well defined path that will m ake AI a source for good. I
also encourage all m odels to be available to every Am erican without charge. AI should not only be available to people who have financial
resources but to every Am erican.
