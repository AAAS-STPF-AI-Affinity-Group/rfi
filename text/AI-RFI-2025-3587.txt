General Comment
AI will irreparably harm  Am erica’s capacity for innovative science and creative work by underm ining our citizens’ capacity for the
challenging cognitive effort needed for future prosperity and well being. I urge great caution in how we develop and deploy these tools,
which are pushed m ore for m arket purposes than For purposes aim ed at strengthening Am erica’s place in the world.
