General Comment
As som eone who has spent decades working in tech, I find the general discussion around AI to be ... overhyped and unreasonable, often
at the expense of existing law.
Current intellectual property protections need to be reinforced, not eroded. ChatGPT, Grok, and other m odels m ust only ingest data
which is public dom ain or properly licensed. To do otherwise throws out the proverbial baby with its bathwater.
This should be addressed by the Legislature and Judiciary, not the Executive.
