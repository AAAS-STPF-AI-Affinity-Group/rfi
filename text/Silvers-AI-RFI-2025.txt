Generative LLM technology should not be trained on copyrighted data with permission and fair 
payme nt. It should not be used without human supervision and fact- checking because it does not 
have human judgment or experience and regularly produces errors and completely fabricated information that can be hazardous to human health and safety. The environmental costs of generative LLM training and use must be mitigated with completely clean energy and improvements in cooling technology that don't waste millions of gallons of water that humans need to survive. All generative LLM technology should be strictly regulated to ensure that it is not trained on stolen data or CSAM material, that it is not used unethically or to replace necessary human labor and creativity,  and that it does not cause further damage to our fragile 
climate.
