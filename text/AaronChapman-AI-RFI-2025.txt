The intellectual property protection of individuals is a major if not the most important
protection to promote competition and growth in the creative fields. The work of anindividual, their labor, is their own and any rights are for the individual parties to negotiate.This is the basic premise of labor in all fields. Generative AI threatens that, destroys thatdynamic. It takes the labor of humans and competes in the marketplace with our own work. Ifcreatives are unable to continue to support themselves, AI will have no source of labor to pullfrom. This will destroy both the individual and the AI. The United State's creative industry isone of our strongest financial and cultural exports. This will destroy an entire industry andcountless American jobs with no benefits. It will not make us the leaders in AI. It will notmake us the leaders in the creative industry. It will not even serve us in the short term. 
This is not only against everything the American Dream of Industry stands for, it's a terrible
business decision. 
Sincerely, Aaron Chapman
