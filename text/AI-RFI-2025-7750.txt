General Comment
Allowing Gen AI com panies to scrape creative works of all kinds at will is a TERRIBLE idea. It would open up m illions of expensive
m an-hours of unique work to be pillaged by total idiots and are putting a bullet in the head of a broad swathe of the US entertainm ent
industry. The econom ic im plications of this are dire an unacceptable. People m ust be able to trust that their hard work will be rewarded or
they will have no m otivation to work -- we will be trapped in AI slop hell forever.
Nothing gen ai creates is even CLOSE to real art. We m ust enforce our existing laws and protect real hum ans from  the unlim ited
exploitation they are threatened by.
