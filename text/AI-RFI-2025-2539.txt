General Comment
AI is a plagiarism  m achine that uses ungodly am ounts of power to run. There is no benefit to anyone other than providing an interm ediary
of theft so corporate interests can steal from  the populous while attem pting to retain deniability for the act.
AI exists as a tool only to steal from  us and give to the 1%. I do not support it in any capacity.
