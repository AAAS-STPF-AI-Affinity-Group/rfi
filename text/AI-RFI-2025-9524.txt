General Comment
I am  a freelance artist and illustrator who has dedicated m y life to developing this extrem ely specific skill. AI is an actual scourge upon the
earth, possibly the m ost frightening and soulless invention after the atom ic bom b. The role of an artist is to help society expand its ability to
think, and the role of AI is the opposite - it is draining us of our ability to understand, im agine, dream  and create. I know the federal
governm ent looks down on such pursuits, but it turns out they are kind of im portant for a functioning society/the hum an race. Down with
AI, it will destroy the hum an m ind.
