General Comment
I am  concerned that the effect of proliferation of AI will be to continue to enrich the richest am ong us. If the United States should have a
policy on AI, it should be that the bounties of new technology ought to be shared am ong all, rather than allowing owners of capital to own
all of wealth created by it. AI is already stealing from  artists across the world, we should tread carefully, not m ove fast and break things.
