General Comment
I don't believe AI has a m eaningful future in Am erica's international standing, especially with the advances in open-source projects that
can, already have, and will likely continue to undercut com m ercial projects. This plan's sole potential is as a m eans to further erode the
rights of Am ericans to own their own creative labor in order to benefit private tech com panies who operate behind opaque curtains. It's an
em barrassm ent to an adm inistration that claim s to be interested in "cutting bloat" from  our nation to so flagrantly kowtow to these
corporate parasites.
