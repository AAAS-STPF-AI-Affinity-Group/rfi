 RE: U.S. AI Action Plan Request for Information 
 Dear Mr. D’Souza: 
 Dcode appreciates the opportunity to provide input on the U.S. AI Action Plan in response to President 
 Trump’s January 2025 Executive Order on AI, which prioritizes U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, 
 streamlining government adoption, and accelerating AI-driven national security and economic 
 competitiveness. 
 Dcode strongly supports the administration’s commitment to ensuring the United States remains at the 
 forefront of AI innovation. To fully realize AI’s potential, the AI Action Plan must emphasize not only AI 
 development but also AI implementation and integration across government agencies at scale. The U.S. 
 cannot afford for AI breakthroughs to remain in research and development cycles without structured, 
 scalable pathways to deploy these capabilities into mission environments where they can deliver real 
 value and results. 
 Aligning the AI Action Plan with the Executive Order: From Development to Deployment  
 President Trump’s Executive Order underscores the need to remove bureaucratic barriers and ensure AI 
 reaches operational users efficiently. While the U.S. leads the world in AI research and development,  
 government agencies continue to struggle with integrating AI in to mission operations due to outdated 
 acquisition models, misaligned priorities, and a lack of clear transition pathways from prototype to 
 full-scale deployment. 
 As a result, the current pace of AI adoption in government does not align with the urgency required to 
 maintain technological superiority. Overcoming these systemic challenges requires a deliberate focus on 
 accelerating AI deployment, ensuring that innovative capabilities move beyond research and into 
 real-world mission environments. The AI Action Plan must establish clear, repeatable pathways for AI 
 integration into operational settings. This includes: 
 ● Expand agile procurement -  Ensuring AI solutions transition from proof-of-concept to full
 deployment within months rather than years by expanding agile procurement mechanisms such as
 Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs), Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs,
 and Replicator initiatives.
 ● Validate in the real world -  Embed AI capabilities directly into operational units to ensure
 real-world validation and rapid scaling.

 ● Strengthening cross-agency AI integration strategies -  Ensure AI deployments align with
 broader national security and intelligence priorities rather than remaining siloed within individual
 departments.
 ● Eliminate barriers to divesting outdated technology  -  C  ontracting constraints, misaligned
 budget priorities, and legacy system dependencies slow AI adoption. AI deployment should not
 be hampered by the inertia of maintaining obsolete capabilities that no longer serve mission
 needs.
 Accelerating AI Deployment at Speed and Scale 
 To maintain U.S. AI leadership and meet the objectives outlined in the Executive Order, AI adoption must 
 move from concept to operational reality at the speed of relevance  .  The AI Action Plan should: 
 ● Mandate a commercial-first approach to ensure agencies prioritize proven private-sector AI
 solutions over costly efforts to recreate existing technology within traditional defense contractors.
 ● Maximize existing DoD AI investments by aligning with Replicator, DIU, and other AI adoption
 initiatives, ensuring AI transitions efficiently into operational programs while eliminating
 redundant spending across agencies.
 ● Remove systemic obstacles to scaling AI by streamlining acquisition, ensuring flexible funding
 mechanisms, and establishing direct pathways for AI insertion into mission operations.
 Leveraging Commercial AI for National Security and Economic Competitiveness 
 The private sector has driven the most significant advancements in AI, and government adoption 
 strategies must be structured to take full advantage of commercial AI innovations. The AI Action Plan 
 should: 
 ● Mandate a commercial-first approach to AI procurement, ensuring agencies prioritize proven
 private sector AI solutions over costly, taxpayer-funded efforts to rebuild existing technology
 within traditional defense contractors.
 ● Maximize existing DoD AI investments by aligning with Replicator, DIU, and other AI adoption
 initiatives, ensuring seamless integration into operational programs while eliminating duplicative
 efforts and redundant spending across agencies.
 ● Ensure AI implementation efforts focus on real mission needs, preventing inefficiencies caused
 by disconnected research projects that do not translate into operational impact.
 Operational AI Integration for Scalable Deployment 
 While AI research remains critical, the government must also establish structured pathways for AI 
 implementation and scaling to ensure that AI capabilities transition from pilots to operational use. This 
 requires a dedicated framework embedded within agencies, defense programs, and intelligence units to  
 drive real adoption, integration, and mission impact.

 To ensure AI deployment remains relevant and adaptive, the government should: 
 ● Embed AI transition teams within agencies to drive integration into mission-critical workflows,
 ensuring solutions are fielded where they are most needed.
 ● Develop dynamic AI implementation playbooks, leveraging private sector expertise to create
 living documents that evolve alongside advancements in AI technology. Standardization should
 enable adoption while remaining flexible enough to keep pace with rapid innovation.
 ● Leverage commercial AI best practices to ensure government adoption strategies remain agile,
 scalable, and focused on outcomes.
 Building a Highly Advanced, AI-Ready Workforce  
 AI adoption is not just a technology challenge—it is also a workforce challenge. The U.S. must take 
 proactive steps to develop an AI-capable workforce that can effectively evaluate, integrate, and deploy AI 
 solutions across mission environments. The AI Action Plan shoul d: 
 ● Invest in AI-focused workforce development programs that prepare engineers, technologists, and
 mission operators to work with AI systems in real-world applications.
 ● Fast-track hiring pathways for AI talent in national security roles, ensuring agencies can access
 top-tier AI professionals without being outcompeted by the private sector.
 ● Establish AI innovation pipelines in partnership with universities and advanced technology
 companies, ensuring a steady flow of highly skilled specialists into mission-critical roles.
 ● Prioritize continuous AI upskilling programs that leverage private sector expertise to ensure
 training materials remain current, adaptive, and mission-focused, rather than becoming obsolete
 government curricula.

 Ensuring the U.S. Leads in AI Adoption 
 AI is no longer just a research priority—it is an operational necessity. The success of the AI Action Plan 
 will be measured not by the volume of AI research conducted but by the number of AI solutions 
 successfully fielded and scaled across government and national security missions. 
 For the U.S. to maintain its competitive edge, AI must move beyond the lab and into real-world 
 environments where it can enhance operational decision-making, increase mission efficiency, and provide 
 asymmetric advantages against adversaries. The government must establish structured mechanisms to 
 evaluate, integrate, and fund AI solutions while eliminating the bureaucratic obstacles that prevent 
 promising technologies from reaching the field. 
 Dcode has worked extensively with emerging AI, cybersecurity, and advanced technology companies to 
 bridge the gap between  innovation and implementation. Through initiatives such as RAIC and DASIC, 
 Dcode is working to accelerate AI adoption by developing structured transition pathways, identifying 
 strategic investment opportunities, and supporting efforts to retire outdated technologies that slow 
 deployment. 
 The AI Action Plan must reflect this urgency by ensuring AI adoption is not an afterthought but a core 
 national security priority. Dcode remains committed to supporting these efforts and working alongside 
 government leaders to ensure that AI capabilities not only exist but are fully operational, scalable, and 
 delivering mission impact at speed. 
 We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this discussion and look forward to continued collaboration 
 with the administration.
