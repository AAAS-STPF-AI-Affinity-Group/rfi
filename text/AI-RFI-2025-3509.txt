General Comment
AI is a bubble on the verge of popping, and it can't pop soon enough. It has done nothing but negatively im pact the lives of people I care
about and take away jobs and carreers, and what few jobs it does create only exist to further this process. I don't think it has a place in
the united states, and i dont think it will last long in china either.
