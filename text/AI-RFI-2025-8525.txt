General Comment
This action has the precedent to com pletely invalidate all copyright law. Norm ally I am  very critical of copyright law, but in this case,
som ething is better than nothing. Doing so would invalidate all Art, Science, Journalism , and even sim ple Com m erce in the USA. Go
Ahead, fight against the basic Econom y, watch your political am bitions be buried. Watch everything the USA has worked on for dam n
near 300 years get thrown out because you don't know what the bathwater looks like, living in your ivory castle.
