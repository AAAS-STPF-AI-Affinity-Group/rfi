General Comment
Generative AI has no positives to bring to the Am erican people - or anyone else, for that m atter. Generative AI has sped up the erosion
and underm ining of hum an creativity, has already caused com m unities to cast doubts on the genuine creations of creatives, and serves no
purpose other than to disrupt, confuse, and deceive. While at first glance, the idea of being able to generate m usic, text and art in the blink
of an eye seem s im pressive and convenient, the long-term  benefits of this technology sim ply don't exist. Google search results are now
polluted with fabricated AI-generated results which are unhelpful and obstructive to education. Budding artists are giving up on their
dream s, because generative AI can create som ething m ore im pressive in an instant - using stolen data, at that - than they could m uster in
years.
Let's not forget that generative AI could not exist in the first place without the m ass processing of people's life's work, en m asse, without
perm ission, AND using an incredible volum e of resources and adding m ore carbon to our atm osphere. If Am erica believes in innovation, it
needs to understand the difference between true innovation, and what Generative AI represents.
