General Comment
I do not believe it is in any Am erican's best interest to give AI Organizations such as OpenAI im m unity from  copyright violations. It is
unfair to sm all businesses and their owners who m ust abide by these laws to allow technology com panies to dodge them  and avoid
accountability, and I believe it goes against the values I hold and that m any other citizens like m e hold to allow large com panies to profit
off the creative work of the average citizen. Furtherm ore, products created by AI are of no appeal to m e, and I'm  fundam entally
uninterested in supporting any com pany which utilizes it to cut corners and provide a cheaper, lesser value product. I strongly oppose any
sort of Executive Orders or legislation of any sort that allows AI operations to go unchecked, and believe their use will only cheaper the
output of Am erican creative endeavors on the whole and opens the nation to ridicule on a worldwide stage. Thank you for your tim e.
