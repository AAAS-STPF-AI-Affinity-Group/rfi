General Comment
Investing in AI Innovation and Education for Healthcare Transform ation:
Federal funding for AI in healthcare is essential to drive innovation, im prove patient outcom es, and enhance operational efficiencies within
health system s. As AI technologies advance, targeted investm ents are needed to support research, developm ent, and deploym ent of AI-
driven solutions in areas such as clinical decision support, predictive analytics, im aging, adm inistrative autom ation, and population health
m anagem ent. Additionally, AI education and workforce developm ent m ust be prioritized to equip healthcare professionals with the
necessary skills to adopt and leverage AI technologies effectively. Health system s require funding to im plem ent AI solutions that enhance
care delivery while ensuring equity, privacy, and security. We urge policym akers to allocate dedicated funding for AI initiatives, including
grants for health system s to pilot AI projects, investm ents in AI-driven data infrastructure and interoperability, and training program s for
clinicians, IT staff, and adm inistrators. By supporting both AI innovation and education, federal funding can help health system s m axim ize
the benefits of AI while ensuring responsible and ethical im plem entation.
Alignm ent with HIPAA and 21st Century Cures Act:
As AI becom es increasingly integrated into healthcare, it is essential to align existing regulations, such as HIPAA and the 21st Century
Cures Act, with em erging AI technologies. HIPAA was designed to protect patient privacy and ensure secure health data exchange, while
the 21st Century Cures Act prom otes interoperability and patient access to electronic health inform ation. However, AI-driven healthcare
applications present new challenges, including autom ated decision-m aking, secondary data use, and the need for transparent and
explainable AI m odels. Policym akers m ust ensure that AI regulations com plem ent HIPAA and the Cures Act, balancing innovation with
patient privacy, security, and access to data. Clear guidance is needed on how AI can responsibly leverage protected health inform ation
(PHI) while m aintaining com pliance with existing privacy laws and prom oting ethical data use. By aligning AI policies with these regulatory
fram eworks, health system s can deploy AI solutions m ore effectively, fostering innovation while safeguarding patient rights and data
integrity.
Behavioral Health / Part 2 Regulations:
From  a behavioral health perspective, it is critical that AI policies account for the unique privacy and regulatory considerations outlined in
42 CFR Part 2, which governs the confidentiality of substance use disorder (SUD) treatm ent records. Unlike traditional healthcare data
protected under HIPAA, Part 2 regulations im pose stricter controls on the use and disclosure of SUD-related inform ation, requiring
explicit patient consent. As AI-driven tools are increasingly used in behavioral health for clinical decision support, predictive analytics, and
patient engagem ent, it is essential that federal AI policies ensure com pliance with Part 2 protections while allowing for responsible
innovation. Clear guidelines are needed to prevent unintended disclosure of sensitive behavioral health data, ensure that AI m odels are
trained with appropriate consent m echanism s, and establish safeguards that protect patients from  potential discrim ination or stigm a. We
urge policym akers to provide specific guidance on how AI can be ethically and effectively deployed in behavioral health settings without
com prom ising patient privacy or regulatory com pliance.
Data Standardization:
Data standardization is essential for ensuring the accuracy, interoperability, and reliability of AI applications in healthcare. As AI m odels
rely on large volum es of diverse data sources, inconsistencies in data form ats, term inologies, and structures can lead to biased or


unreliable outcom es. Federal AI policies should prom ote the adoption of standardized data fram eworks, such as HL7 FHIR, SNOMED
CT, LOINC, and ICD-10, to facilitate seam less data exchange across electronic health records (EHRs), clinical decision support
system s, and research initiatives. Standardization is critical for im proving care coordination, enhancing AI m odel perform ance, and
enabling m ore effective decision-m aking across the healthcare continuum . We urge policym akers to establish clear guidelines for AI
developers, ensuring adherence to industry-recognized data standards while m aintaining com pliance with patient privacy and security
regulations. A standardized approach will not only im prove AI-driven insights but also foster innovation and equitable access to healthcare
advancem ents.
