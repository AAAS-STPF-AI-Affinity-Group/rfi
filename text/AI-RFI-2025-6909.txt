General Comment
Allowing Generative AI free reign in ignorance of previously established copyright laws would be a disastrous m isstep both for those out
favor and in of the use of Generative AIâ€” For those against it, it is sim ply unethical, and due to being against all other existing laws;
Unjust. Why m ake an exception? Why justify theft, if so m any laws are placed against it? Does the country openly support stealing from
its citizens and com panies that m ake up its com m erce?
And even for those in its favor, it rem oves the ability to train on one's curated works (i.e. The Walt Disney Com pany training on their own
work) and self-prom ote its own properties and continue to support a healthy com petitive environm ent for com m erce. Ethical argum ents
aside, this m ove would sim ply collapse upon itself, prim arily to the harm  of the com panies located within the United States.
