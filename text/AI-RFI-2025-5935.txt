General Comment
I am  writing to say that I do NOT support any AI based on stolen work. Copyright exists for a reason--to protect m y rights as an author
of over fifty published works. If another author stole m y work and put their nam e on it, changed the nam es of the characters--that would
be theft and I could sue them  for it. It shouldn't be any different for AI. No LLM has com pensated m e for m y work, m y knowledge or m y
tim e--all of which is valuable--but m y work has been scraped repeatedly. It should be illegal for 'scraping' to happen, it's affected m y
sales, m y ability to get future book contracts--m y entire livelihood is at risk because of AI. 
Am erica is built upon the creative ideas and products of Am ericans, not regurgitated nonsense. AI has no future in Am erica and no future
in publishing and further investing in it is throwing good m oney after bad. When it crashes--and it will--it will take a lot of lazy folks' m oney
with it. 
Just say NO to AI!
