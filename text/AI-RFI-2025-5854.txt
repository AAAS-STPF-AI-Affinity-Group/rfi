General Comment
AI, and the large language m odels developed by OpenAI, is being deployed in ways that harm  society. They harm  learning, and they
m ake inhum an decisions that take people’s lives without accountability. They are incapable of understanding the im portance of facts —
they sim ply use past patterns to predict future text, with no guardrails to guarantee that their results are useful or true. 
I work in a field where m achine learning has been a tool used to m ake great strides. It can be extrem ely useful in the hands of som eone
who understands the constraints of a problem  dom ain. The problem  is that OpenAI is being m arketed as a do-all solution when clearly it
is not. The m odel relies upon a hum an-created corpus of work and intellectual contribution to produce its predictions. Altm an him self has
acknowledged that the field is at a point of dim inishing returns and can not advance m ore without access to m ore hum an-created corpus.
He can not m ake m ore m oney without stealing copyrighted work, that is what this boils down to. Don’t let these vultures strip our society
and the accum ulation of hum an knowledge bare for a sham  “artificial intelligence” party trick.
