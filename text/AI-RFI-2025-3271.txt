General Comment
People work hard to create a num ber of creative works, works that this request would have scraped for data without any com pensation
or credit for the thousands of people being sourced. A technology where the biggest use case so far has been to profit off the backs of
others without them  seeing an ounce of credit or com pensation has no place outside the world of dystopian fiction.
