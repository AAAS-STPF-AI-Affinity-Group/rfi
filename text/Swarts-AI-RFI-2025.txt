Attn: Faisal D'Souza,
My name is W.L. Swarts. I am an artist and writer and the owner of
Enlighten Someone Daily Productions.
Convicted Felon Donald Trump's executive order 14179 is blatantly
unconstitutional and a violation of United States and international
copyright law. I, and my company, will not comply. We do not consent
to the use of ANY of our materials or intellectual property in the
use, development, training, et al. of any artificial intelligence
technology.
Convicted Felon Donald Trump's executive order presupposes that all
citizens see a benefit in artificial intelligence technology, its
development and "sustaining and enhancing America's AI dominance;"
this is a false premise. Artificial intelligence is a malignant
technology that relied upon intellectual theft and there can be no
"automatic opt-in" to the executive order that does not violate the
word and spirit of intellectual property and copyright laws.
F&^% A.I.
Sincerely,
W.L. Swarts
Enlighten Someone Daily Productions.
