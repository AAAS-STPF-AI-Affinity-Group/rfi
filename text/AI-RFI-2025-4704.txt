General Comment
Hello, 
Please do not give OpenAI im m unity from  copyright liability. I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y
livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. Its benefits are vastly over reported (AI gives the wrong answer 60% of the tim e). What
has happened to the prom ise of the Am erican dream  if you can create som ething only to have your idea stolen by OpenAI?
