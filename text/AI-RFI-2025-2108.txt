General Comment
Artificial Intelligence holds no reason to be relevant in the "advancem ent" for the United States. AI violates the people's right of
copyrighted m aterials and intellectual property. Allowing this to proceed entirely destroy legal system s that are in our constitution in order
to get away with theft of individual creative works. It is unconstitutional and illegal.
