General Comment
The im plications of unfettered AI exploitation of hum an copyright is so far beyond what is being considered by AI proponents that it is
gross negligence and ignorant optim ism . They're so gung-ho about elim inating copyright protections that they don't even realize that
OTHER AI startups can sim ply steal from  their supposed "work" and they lose all value instantly. Not that they have that m uch value;
when the one of the m ain proponents of AI claim  that their golden goose will not "suddenly com e up with unrelated/unwanted ideas," it
doesn't fill m e with m uch confidence on the "creativity" of AI tools.
AI is an affront to hum an creativity and com pletely disregards existing copyright law.
We'll see how well AI perform s when, say, Disney properties suddenly get scraped for their tripe or Warner Bros or ANY entertainm ent
based com pany.
