General Comment
AI, as it currently is being used, is theft taking from  hard working Am ericans. It is not only stealing from  their past works, it is stealing from
their ability to work.
As som eone who has em ployed creatives (artists and writers), I can see the lure to using AI, but I can not m orally or ethically support it in
any way.
You cannot support "hum an flourishing, econom ic com petitiveness, and national security" by relying on AI, and without protecting the
ACTUAL individuals who m ake hum an flourishing possible (the Am erican PEOPLE, not algorithm s)
You DESTROY "econom ic com petitiveness" by allowing AI to take from  copyrighted works.
There is no "national security" if the people who produce the wealth of our culture are not protected from  the predatory actions of Google
and OpenAI.
