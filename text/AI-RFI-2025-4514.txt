General Comment
The requirem ents that AI m odels not steal or use copyrighted or otherwise protected work are not burdensom e, they are com m on sense
m easures to protect Am erican labor and intellectual property rights. It's short sighted to assum e that creatives or sm all businesses will not
be unduly harm ed by AI without guardrails, to say nothing of the tangible im pact on the environm ent. Do NOT m ake ti easier for AI
com panies to hurt Am ericans, do NOT favor business interests over the lives of tax-paying, hardworking Am ericans.
