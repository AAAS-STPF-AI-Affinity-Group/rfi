General Comment
Am erica was built on innovation, but this was not just technological innovation. People travel from  all over the world to visit Disney
World, because it's a powerful Am erican cultural icon. That icon was built by people, sm art and creative artists and engineers.
That Am erican cultural legacy has also been protected by robust legal fram eworks and international agreem ents that ensure the Am erican
people that developed these cultural and technological achievem ents can enjoy the fruits of their labor.
A com puter server is not creative. It's creations are not the products of hard-working Am erican's building this nation into som ething
greater. It's scanning their works and copying it.
AI has proven itself tim e and again to be deeply flawed, unreliable, and untrustworthy. This technology is deeply unprofitable and AI is not
the future of the United States. We are nation built on capitalism , and the m arket has spoken when it com es to AI.
I also fail to see any legitim ate national security concerns that would justify this. An AI used for tracking terrorists has no need for stealing
books, art, or m ovies. As a citizen I find it deeply disturbing that soldiers and federal agents would need AIs trained on fictional works of
art to protect our country.
AI is not the future of the United State, and AI algorithm s em ployed in the defense of our nation have no need to be trained on legally
protected intellectual properties or copyrighted works.
