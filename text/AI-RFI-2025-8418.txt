General Comment
So-called "generative AI" is built around theft of intellectual property. A robust set of laws needs to be put in place to regulate its ability to
be trained on (IE steal) copyrighted m aterial. As both a writer and artist, I do not want any m aterial I create to be used for any purpose
without m y control or consent, including and especially training a program  that will be used to put people like m e out of work.
