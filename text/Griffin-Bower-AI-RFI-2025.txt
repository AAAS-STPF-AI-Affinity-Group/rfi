Don't allow this to fly you f&^% idiots. Did anyone else even read this? If someone wrote a 
parody piece describing this exact situation 4 years ago it would've been called "too  
hamfisted" and "too obvious." Brighter future for Americans by allowing widespread data  
theft? People should be killed for attempting to even initiate this, and a lot of people's  
livelihoods will be annihilated due to this. That'll leave you with people whose lives were  
ruined, nothing to lose, strong opinions, and addresses of you people.
