General Comment
AI has no place in governm ent, it is a theft engine that will put vulnerable inform ation at further risk. It has no benefit and is all cost.
It is used to steal copywritten works, plagarizes protected properties, and siphon everything from  hum ans.
It deserves no exem ptions or placem ent in the governm ent, and m ust be reigned in at every corner.
The governm ent works for the people and it is your job to shutter any further theft from  crim inal enterprises and their "AI" spyware.
