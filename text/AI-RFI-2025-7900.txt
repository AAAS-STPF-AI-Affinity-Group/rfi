General Comment
This bill is obscenely dangerous for any and all artists, allowing their work to be legally stolen and used without them  giving their consent
or recieving proper com pensation. Even m ore broadly, it could very feasably renders concept like copyright and fair use essentially
m eaningless, as one could use an AI trained on copyrighted m aterials to recreate it. Altogether, this is a sloppy and senseless bill that only
serves to harm  creatives while lining the pockets of m illionaires, and should be stopped.
