General Comment
AI is inefficient and absolutely im m oral when it com es to GenAI. Creators deserve to share without fear of their hard work being stolen
and being able to do nothing about it. AI should be regulated heavily and scrutinized and should DEFINITELY hold absolutely NO
bearing on copyright. It's downright hypocritical if they're STEALING from  creators.
