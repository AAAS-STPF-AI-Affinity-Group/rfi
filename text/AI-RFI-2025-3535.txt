General Comment
As a m useum  curator, I have seen the products of OpenAI take the work of m y colleagues and regurgitate it (less elegantly than the
original writing), claim ing that it is original content. This is theft of intellectual property, clear plagiarism  of academ ic work. It is disgraceful
and will have catastrophic repercussions for the cultural heritage sector.
