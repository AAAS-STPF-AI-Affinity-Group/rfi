General Comment
No AI software should be legally perm itted to access the proprietary creative output of hum an beings. Their creative work is often their
prim ary m eans of survival, and allowing AI software to steal their creations is clearly a step toward destroying the lives and livelihoods of
m illions of talented Am ericans. It would also be m istake for the long-term  viability of generative AI. Without steady input of original
creative content, AI system s would quickly start digesting other AI content, steadily degrading the output and rendering generative AI
utterly useless.
