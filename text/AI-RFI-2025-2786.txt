General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to freely without restriction engage in copyright infringem ent is both antithetical to the creativity and com petition
that has driven all of Am erica's success and threatens the livelyhoods of alm ost every Am erican citizen. We cannot allow this theft to go
unim peded. If the industry around AI cannot survive without stealing others work, then it clearly has no place here in the US.
