General Comment
Open AI and generative AI **cannot** be allowed im m unity or any legal part in any action plan. It has *already* been ruled to be
copyright infringem ent. Even if im m unity stops lawsuits or copyright infringem ent in this country, there's no way to regulate it internationally,
and the US will still be vulnerable to infringem ent from  elsewhere. It will be bad for US revenue dom estically and internationally and bad
for exports. Keep Open AI and generative AI away. Don't let it steal any m ore than it already has
