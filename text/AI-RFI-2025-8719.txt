General Comment
Approval of the theft of copyrighted work is unconscionable and should absolutely NOT be allowed. 
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public
* There is no other industry that could credibly m ake this dem and and be approved as a a special exception to steal as a m eans of bailing
out their poorly conceived "business" m odel. Absolutely not.
