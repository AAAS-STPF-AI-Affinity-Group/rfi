General Comment
GenAI is a waste of resources for our country and the world. It drains the finite resources we have and uses energy we do not need to use
for som ething we do not need as a society. Things like OpenAI are being jam m ed down consum ersâ€™ throats when the vast m ajority of
norm al people (not businesses or tech people) do not want it. It steals the intellectual property of people and m arkets it as original. It is
unethical and a plague on our society.
