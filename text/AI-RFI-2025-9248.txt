General Comment
AI sets a dangerous precedent the way it is currently run, it steals jobs, eradicates entire industries, com pletely dum bs down education
and regurgitates artists creation and allows others to use it for scam m ing others. Not to m ention the severe environm ental im pact is not
worth it. AI should be used to m ake the burdensom e chores like tax calculations and laundry and cleaning easier, NOT ART, NOT
WORDS.
