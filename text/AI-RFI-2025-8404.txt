General Comment
The push for Al is legalized theft by irresponsible tech businessm en who bet on a dead end and are trying to cram  it down our throats by
any m eans.
Legalizing theft for giant corps and ignoring our entire tradition of copyright is the height of hypocrisy and frankly traitorous to art and the
hum an race.
Disgusting and predatory, this would directly cut into and im pede m y sm all business in a wildly illegal fashion. The people behind this
disgraceful scam  are trying to use clout, bluster, and special access to pillage their fellow Am ericans without rem orse.
