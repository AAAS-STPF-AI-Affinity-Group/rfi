General Comment
AI com panies are now trying to change the rules. Knowing that their technology is losing in the courts, they now want to change the laws
in able to feed data to a notoriously bias, power hungry, inaccurate and unprofitable technology. 
The reason that Google and OpenAi want to stay com petitive with China is a farce. They do not want to be held accountable to the
m illions of creators they have stolen from . GenAi as we know is a technology that has proven to be useless and ultim ately unpopular. The
business that are “pioneering” Ai are built on m onstrous overvaluations are not even close to m aking any sort of real profit. Backing them
is risking bankrupting anyone organization that chooses to back them .
