General Comment
AI has a lot of potential, but it has a long way to go and having guardrails in place to m onitor the developm ent and use of personal data
and inform ation to train m odels for m oney m aking endeavors strips all of us of our ability to hold our inform ation private.
Additionally, the environm ental im pact of AI could be devastating to our future and national security.
We are inviting all kinds of hum an disaster to enable technology to replace hum an capital and place extrem e stress on infrastructures
m eant to support hum an life.
AI is being powered m ore by greed than by its potential to both im prove and likely negatively im pact hum ans.
It is not tim e to abandon all efforts at regulation. It is tim e for sensible approach, as well as a clear view of both the positive and negative
im pacts of AI.
