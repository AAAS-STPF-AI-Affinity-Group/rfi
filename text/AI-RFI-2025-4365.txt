General Comment
As an artist and software developer, generative AI m odels have vastly im pacted m y fields (and experience in these fields) for the negative.
My own artwork has been scraped without m y perm ission (or knowledge, until I was inform ed by others and found it being used in som e
m odels) for faceless corporations to steal and churn out to others - all without m y perm ission, m uch less any financial com pensation. It's
theft, pure and sim ple. If you cannot m ake a large-scale language learning m odel without using m edia without perm ission, then you cannot
m ake a large-scale language learning m odel. That's theft.
