General Comment
If AI com panies are allowed to just take m aterial from  artists without any restrictions or consequences, the effects to creatives both
individually and collectively will be devastating. I urge those in power to vote against this clear abuse of artists talents and work! 
The m ost im pactful and im portant works of art and culture com e from  the m ind and hand of living breathing artists. Generative AI can only
copy heartlessly. To even call these program s “intelligent” is wildly m isleading as they are sim ply software program s designed to “guess”
properly. For the sake of not just working artists but for the greater whole of our cultural experience, I strongly oppose GenAI
corporations the ability to take intellectual property to m erely copy it without any legal obligation to the original creator or owners.
