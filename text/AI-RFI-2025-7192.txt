General Comment
It is absolutely unacceptable to grant this "AI" free reign to steal copyrighted m aterial and personal inform ation and use it to generate an
endless flood of repetitive dreck and m isinform ation. Generative AI does not produce anything the average Am erican wants or needs, and
constantly generates false positives and false negatives when used to answer any kind of question. Spending governm ent funds on
generative AI is worse than just burning the sam e am ount of m oney.
