AI is a great way to ruin the lives and careers of the living, breath ing writers, m usicians, and artists around the world. If that's what 
AI does, f&^% it - burn it off the planet. It's one thing to have AI learn and process data to help solve problem s or mathem atical 
equation s. It's completel y anoth er thing to use "generative AI" to generate music, books, art, etc. from stolen , un-authorized 
sources.
There's not one profession al compan y out there that is peddl ing AI that isn't a large scale criminal organ ization who steals what they 
find on the internet without any qualms about it.
If we're going to waste our time and resou rces on this, then these damn compan ies MUST be forced to respect ALL copyri ght laws 
and license the data they use. If peopl e complai n that other countries wont do the same thing, then sancti on their asses, tariff them , 
hell, bomb  them for all I care - but don't destroy the creati ve abilities of humans for the cheap, capital istic asshol es who don't want 
to suffer the sam e  responsibi lities as the rest of us. 
AI wants to learn and grow, then they need to pay up.
If you give them the ability to side-step ANY aspect of copyri ght, we're completel y f&^%d and you will have just ruined more 
lives and  jobs than you will ever create or see grow.
