As an academic who studies AI policy, I would recommend focusing on " process
regulation"  as the federal government's central strategy for pro AI innovation and insight
governance. Unlike "substantive regulation" which limits what developers can do,
"process regulation" regulates how they can do it. For example, ingredient bans aresubstantive regulation and requirements for nutrition facts are process regulation. Thus,I believe that process regulation (e.g. requiring documentation from developers) wouldbe a pro-innovation approach that also allows for a more informed public.
 
As an example of a process regulation-focused draft, see the Preserving American
Dominance in Artificial Intelligence Act  draft from last congress which was introduced
by a senate republican.
