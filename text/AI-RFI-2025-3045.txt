General Comment
Allowing AI to train on content that isn't there is another way of stealing som eone's creation. Which is Robbing and putting 2 and 2
together is illegal. It should be able to do this since the creators are against there creations being stolen from  others. Consent is needed
and should be applied. Plus, AI has no right to take art from  others. Not only it just edits the original because of its program m ing, but it
also shows that person use AI on the original isn't even a real artist. They just let an com puter do the work for them . Which as well all
know is lazy.
