General Comment
I don't think that the USFG should do anything to help AI corporations in the US. They don't provide anywhere near useful work for the
vast am ounts of resources they consum e. The am ount of power, water, and hi tech chips are being used to m ake a m achine that can spout
confident sounding words back at you. Over the past few years they've had plenty of tim e to show that they can m ake a product that
people want, but they haven't. This is throwing m oney into a bubble that is going to pop. And if they ever did work, its by stealing from  the
Am erican people to enrich m onopolists. There's no way that AI com panies should get special rules to break the law the rest of us have to
follow. You can't m ake an AI sm all business. Its a bad deal.
