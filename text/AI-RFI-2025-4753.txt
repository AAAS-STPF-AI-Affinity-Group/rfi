General Comment
AI Is an em barrassm ent to actual hum an creative efforts and does not have a place in this country’s future. So far, AI has been used to cut
pay to actual workers to generate a cheap m ockery of hum an work. AI m odels, from  the start, have been built on theft of actual work and
has disregarded copyright laws. We can’t allow AI to be put on a pedestal above actual hum ans.
