General Comment
Any AI advancem ent should be beholden to copywrite law,data being indeterm inately scraped without perm ission or paym ent form
Am erican citizens m ust be stopped. Private citizens have had their personal m edical data added to these datasets. It's full of porn and
sinister content from  across the internet because no one has cared to vet it. No one is overseeing that AI has m orals or codes of ethics,
this technology is being pushed fast in an attem pt to cash in and cash out at taxpayer's expense. AI has been around several years now,
we have seen how in practice it hallucinates untrue answers constantly, we m ust be considerate of what we are actually creating and how
m any valuable resources like energy we are putting into haphazard technology. Especially now when we are on the verge of threats of
energy being cut from  Canada.
