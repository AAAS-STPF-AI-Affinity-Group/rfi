General Comment
On absolutely all levels, this should not be passed. While there is a future in which AI can help hum ans flourish, right now AI is being used
to find ways to drive hum ans out of jobs for the sake of efficiency. We *need* restrictions in order to develop better AI-related
algorithm s and program s in a way that strictly benefits hum ans--not in one that freely profits from  our creations, not in an attem pt to
replace hum an jobs for profit-m inded reasons. Please do not consider this plan whatsoever.
