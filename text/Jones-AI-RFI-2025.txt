Jayla Jones,  
My name is Jayla Jones and I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High 
Scho ol. I completed a semester course on AI and Ethics and studied the impacts of Generative 
AI on the environment and energy consumption. AI technology is a resourc eful tool but is also a 
large concern in the topic of energy consumption and efficiency. I have found in research that AI uses and emits large amounts of energy and creates an inflated carbon footprint. EO 14179 will disrupt safe energy consumption and the  safety of the environment and emission levels.
