General Comment
Innovation is m eant to transform  and change, and this approach to AI only ensures everyone will get m ore of the sam e while hurting the
people who have som ething new to say. AI will not be the death of art, art is hum an and we’d have to be extinct as a species before that
ever happens. But, this just ensures it never reaches its full potential, where old voices are disrespected, new voices give up, and em erging
voices don’t even get a chance at the starting line either due to lack of incentive or lack of practice. Requirem ents, rules, regulations,
whatever word you’d like to use for the things you believe are hindering you, have consistently been the reasons innovation takes place.
This ensures that the perception and execution of AI will only becom e negative quicker than it already has, and will leave everyone, from
artists to stakeholders to newborns, worse off.
