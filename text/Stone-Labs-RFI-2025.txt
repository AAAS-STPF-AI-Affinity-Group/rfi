I. Introduction
On behalf of Stone Labs, it is my privilege to submit these comments in response to the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Networking and Information Technology 
Research and Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office’s Request for Information on 
the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. Stone Labs is an AI Development 
and Integration agency that provides end-to-end services covering solution design, model 
development, and full-scale AI integration. Our global client work spans multiple industries 
(finance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and more), giving us a unique vantage on both the 
cutting-edge of AI innovation and the commercial realities of implementing AI systems 
responsibly. 
We believe that AI presents a transformative opportunity for the United States to reinforce its 
global leadership in technology, economic competitiveness, and workforce development. 
Achieving these goals requires sensible, forward-looking policies that encourage private sector 
innovation while ensuring effective safeguards for national security, data privacy, and ethical 
responsibility.

II. Potential Impact of Commercial AI Software on OSTP Objectives
1.Accelerating Innovation and Adoption
○Commercial Readiness: Modern AI solutions - ranging from large language
models to computer vision systems - are increasingly accessible and
production-ready. Strategic policy measures that streamline regulatory pathways
can help drive accelerated adoption across key sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance,
infrastructure), while maintaining robust risk checks.○Industry Collaboration : Cross-sector partnerships, in which private firms (like
Stone Labs) collaborate with government agencies, spur the rapid development
and deployment of new AI tools and platforms. Such partnerships could include
proof-of-concept pilots under government sponsorship or improved grant
programs for small and medium businesses innovating in AI. 2.Preserving National Security and Data Privacy
○Security-Driven AI Development: Commercial AI software that follows best
practices in data encryption, identity management, and secure model design can
reduce vulnerabilities. Encouraging these standards through voluntary
frameworks and minimal but effective regulation can help industry meet national
security objectives without undue burden.○Scalable Compliance: Practical, unified guidelines on data handling, model
explainability, and cybersecurity can keep AI development agile while supporting
consistent compliance across sectors.3.Enhancing Workforce Development
○Education and Training : Commercial AI solutions will continue to require
specialized development and oversight. Government-driven partnerships with
companies like Stone Labs can deliver training programs, apprenticeship
pipelines, and reskilling initiatives for workers to ensure a steady supply of talent
for emerging AI job roles.○State and Local Government Assistance: Creating government-funded AI
innovation centers in collaboration with private AI solution providers can upskill
2 


local communities and expand participation in the AI-driven economy. 
III. Recommended Policy Actions
To bolster American leadership in AI and support the flourishing of innovative commercial 
software, we recommend the following actions for inclusion in the AI Action Plan: 
1.Establish Public-Private AI Testbeds
○Pilot Programs: Encourage pilot programs bringing government agencies and
industry AI partners together to test and refine AI models on real-world problems.
Emphasize structured feedback loops that inform future policymaking and shared
best practices. 2.Expand AI Education and Workforce Initiatives
○National AI Upskilling Campaign : Leverage federal funding, private-sector
expertise, and local institutions to create comprehensive AI certification
programs. Include advanced skill tracks for data engineers, machine learning
engineers, and AI solution architects, as well as foundational tracks for broader
participation. 3.Adopt a Flexible Regulatory Framework
○Adaptive Compliance: Develop tiered guidelines for AI model development and
deployment, matching regulatory requirements to a model’s level of risk or
domain of use. This approach preserves agility for commercial innovation while
ensuring accountability where it matters most.○Proactive Security Standards: Promote commercial AI providers’ adoption of
secure development standards (e.g., robust encryption at rest and in transit,
zero-trust architectures) by offering incentives (tax benefits, direct funding
support) for early compliance. 4.Encourage Open Source Collaboration
3 


○Open Source Platforms: Incentivize open source AI frameworks and
model-sharing initiatives to accelerate the discovery, testing, and refinement of
novel AI techniques. This can reduce duplicative efforts across industry and
academia and foster more rapid advances in critical AI subfields.5.Foster International Cooperation
○Global AI Alliances: Collaborate with international partners to harmonize AI
standards and protocols, ensuring interoperability and mitigating risks of
cross-border data misuse. Sustained efforts in global dialogue and leadership will
strengthen the United States’ role as a central hub for AI development.
IV. Stone Labs’ Contribution and Proposed Collaboration
As an AI Development and Integration agency, Stone Labs stands ready to assist OSTP, partner 
agencies, and industry participants by: 
1.Providing Tailored AI Solutions: We design and develop AI-driven applications -
ranging from predictive analytics to enterprise-scale model deployment - to meet specific
strategic goals across government and private sectors.2.Implementing Secure, Scalable Systems: Our expertise includes robust data privacy
strategies, compliance with security regulations, and the design of scalable solutions that
can adapt to varying workloads and mission-critical requirements.3.Delivering Training and Workforce Development: We can partner with educational
institutions and local governments to create efficient knowledge transfer programs that
elevate AI fluency and hands-on expertise within both technical and non-technical
communities.4.Co-Creating AI Standards and Best Practices: We are prepared to share insights from
our commercial projects and collaborate with policy committees to define ethical
guidelines, risk assessments, and validation criteria for safe, transparent AI models.
V. Conclusion
