General Comment
Please do not allow AI to steal from  creatives. This is an unjust and unfair expansion of a system  that will lead to the reduction of our
creative m arket as a whole. AI has zero right to use talented creative work as a m eans of m aking profit. This will put hundreds of
thousands of talented creators in a m arket where they are com peting with a m achine that soullessly and sham elessly reuses their hard
work. It is im possible for any hum an to com pete with a m achine, especially one that will thrive off the backs of hard working artists,
writers, and other creatives.
We beg that you please reconsider and do not allow AI to further ruin creative industries.
