General Comment
I urge you not to destroy the law for sm oke and m irrors. “AI” or large language m odels (LLMs) are an overhyped set of algorithm s with
lim ited utility. They are stealing from  regular Am erican workers, and the country will be m uch worse off as a result. For the security of all
Am ericans, this technology should be regulated carefully, and com panies that violated copyright in developing these m odels m ust be held
to account. Am erican workers have rights and the governm ent needs to enforce them .
