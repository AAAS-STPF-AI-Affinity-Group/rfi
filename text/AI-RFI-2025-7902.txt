General Comment
I strongly believe that AI has no future in the United States of Am erica. It is a pet project of tech com panies to flaunt their technology at
the expense of Am erican artists and creativity. Unem ploym ent for artists will rise. The quality of AI produced m edia will reduce. The profit
generated from  those AI projects will be negligible once the initial hype of AI artwork goes away. The only AI Action Plan that should be
developed is one which addresses the rights of original content creators and tradem ark holders as well as the risk and im pact to Am erican
jobs and em ploym ent.
