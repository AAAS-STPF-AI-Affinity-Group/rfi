General Comment
“Artificial intelligence” as we know it is a sham  - and it’s one based on theft. Com panies’ intent with AI is to reduce their reliance on real,
hom egrown Am erican jobs, to steal hardworking artists and editors and workers’ products with im punity, and to sell the public a product
that is consistently broken and wrong. I feel that the current AI craze is antithetical to the Am erican dream  itself, and I hope that the
governm ent feels the sam e way.
