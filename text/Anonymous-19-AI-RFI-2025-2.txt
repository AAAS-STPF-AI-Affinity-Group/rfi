The United States has long stood at the pinnacle of technological advancement, and its 
leadership in the AI sector is a testament to this legacy. As the global vanguard of AI research, 
development, and deployment, the U.S. is uniquely positioned not only t o shape the future of AI 
but also to shoulder the profound responsibility of ensuring that these transformative 
technologies are deployed ethically and with foresight. While the export of AI technologies holds 
immense promise —fueling economic progress, fos tering international collaboration, and 
enhancing global competitiveness —it also presents significant risks. Among these, the most 
alarming is the potential for AI to be exploited for malicious or destructive purposes. The 
weaponization of AI —whether throu gh autonomous weapons, deepfake technology, or AI -
powered cyberattacks —poses an unprecedented threat to global peace, security, and stability. To 
confront these challenges head -on and mitigate the risks of AI misuse, the United States must 
take a bold step  toward defining a comprehensive, transparent framework for the responsible 
exportation of AI technologies. I propose the creation of the United States AI Leadership 
Alliance & Impact Forum (USAIA -IF)—a bold, unified initiative designed to drive global AI 
innovation while ensuring ethical development, sustainable growth, and the protection of 
international security. This platform will enable the U.S. to collaborate with allied nations to 
establish binding global standards and regulations for AI, with an unw avering focus on safety, 
privacy, and preventing misuse. By leading this global effort, the U.S. will not only solidify its 
position as the foremost authority in AI but also ensure that AI technologies are deployed in 
ways that advance the greater good of humanity, safeguarding both global prosperity and peace.
