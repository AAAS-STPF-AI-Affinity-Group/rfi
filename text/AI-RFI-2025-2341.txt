General Comment
Dear NSF,
Artificial Intelligence has to be used intelligently, and safely, if it's going to be used at all. Products like ChatGPT and Dall-E have been
trained off of skim m ed and stolen data, with no possible way of tracking back who it was trained by, or from . These two m odels, in
particular, are em blem atic of the problem  of LLMs (Large Language Models). There is a use case for AI in detecting cancer early, or to
convey em otional im agery to explain a person's m ental state during therapy, or in creating superconductive chips that Hum ans stuggle to
refine further. With that said, creative works such as voice acting, writing, digital artwork and m usic MUST be protected. 
The negative utilization of artificial intelligence to not only decrease wages for creative workers, or even force them  even further into an
unbalanced 'gig' econom y m akes it a danger to the people of the US, and arguably the entire world. If you cannot balance com pany's
desire for near instant gratification and expansion with the dangers of a Large Language Model, then it will do far m ore harm  than good.
I feel legislative protections for creative works (Artists, Musicians, Authors, ect) need to be in place before we look at becom ing the
forefront of Artificial Intelligence, because otherwise you'll destroy the underlying m essage of what it even m eans to be an Am erican.
Sincerely
A concerened citizen
