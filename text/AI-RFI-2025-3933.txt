General Comment
Copyright protections absolutely m ust be preserved. The m edium  or end user, and their intentions are not relevant and do not override the
rights of the copyright holder. No m aterial should be used without perm ission, and stronger enforcem ent should be applied to those
com panies or entities that have already used or continue to use m aterials without perm ission. In cases where laws m ay be unclear they
should be reworded to prevent any loopholes or m isinterpretations that are used to justify the use of copyrighted m aterial with perm ission.
