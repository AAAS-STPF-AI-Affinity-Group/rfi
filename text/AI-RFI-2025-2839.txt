General Comment
This goes agaist everyones privacy as a citizen. Not only that, but AI is such a new and upcom ing thing that has hit the m edia and is purely
hype. It is the new “big cool thing” and is not sustainable for the long term  future. AI only does a m ediocre job, and reiterating on it to get
som ething good is painstaking and near im possible. Not only that, but due to it being built on the data of other people, it is a copyright
nightm are.
