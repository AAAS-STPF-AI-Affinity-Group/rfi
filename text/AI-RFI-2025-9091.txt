General Comment
GenAI would irreparably dam age the world of creativity by recycling what we already have instead of seeking to create new thoughts or
ideas. It only seeks to rip off what has already been m ade, not put any unique twist or perspective shift, and regurgitate what it thinks is
"new art". AI does not have the heart and soul of a hum an that can understand and grow and change. Art is beautiful because it is based
upon our experiences and im agination. AI only grabs im ages and words and sm ashes them  into what can only be described as an
am algam ation of m isconstrued lines and colors. I firm ly disagree with allowing AI to train on copyrighted works.
