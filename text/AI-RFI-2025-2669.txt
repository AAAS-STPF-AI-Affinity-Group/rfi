General Comment
The "product" being shoveled out as "AI" is not the sam e com puter-assisted learning tools that we were using and m aking progress with a
decade ago. The m odern "AI" product is a resource wasting m onstrosity that has no focused learning, and com piles everything without
consequence. Servers churn and produce slop instead of being an assistant. Text to speech is now replaced with a bot that regurgitates
every piece of inform ation it has pulled from  as m any websites as possible in the form  of a m isinform ed paragraph. Brands are now
replacing their design departm ent with sloppy im ages that will never spell the nam e correctly. Generative AI, as it is called, produces a
soulless product that no one finds inspiring. The general m alaise that "AI" has brought about am ong the general public on top of the
dam age it has done, before we even get into the copyright m ud, is enough to show that it isn't worth it to invest in the current technology.
Investors are jingling keys in front of us all with bogus prom ises of profit and exponential growth, however there is an econom ic fallout that
will follow as the tech fails to deliver on a widescale. This beast that is being dubbed as AI is not good, and we m ust go back to the
drawing board to study and find technology that propels autom ation the right way and not one that hurts workers and potentially our
econom y.
