General Comment
As an artist, I depend on m y work to be seen and m ore, for it to be a source of incom e. My works are inherently m ine, and when anyone
uses them  or tries to claim  them  as som ething they have a right to, we know that to be illegal. Allowing AI com panies to willfully, and
knowingly, take copyrighted works and use them  for their own gain is nothing short of a direct attack on m e, m y work, and all copyright
holding persons and industries. If AI is allowed to take anything it finds, be that directly input or scraped from  sites without the knowing
and willful consent of the original creator, then all copyright could be then considered null and void. For what then can stop som eone from
taking the data of a com pany's proprietary technology, feeding to an AI to get som ething 'new', and therefor circum vent the copyright
violation? What is stopping com panies from  replacing artists with poor and cheap im itations? What incentive is there from  killing jobs and
stealing work from  honest Am ericans? 
If Am erica wants to stand tall and proud in the global AI race, then it needs strong copyright protections, and strong AI standards of what
can be used and how. Am erica can stand as a bastion to people over m achines, to people over profits and m ore, it can shape the global
AI trend of violating copyright. Stand with artists, stand with Am ericans. 
Do not allow profit to overcom e real people.
