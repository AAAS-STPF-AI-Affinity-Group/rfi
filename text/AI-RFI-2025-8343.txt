General Comment
AI continues to steal decades of hard word from  artist and creatives yet does not give the proper credit and or paym ent nor does it
receive the proper perm issions or consent to use such copyrighted works. Just so it can profit off of hard working passionate creatives. AI
as it stands is a risk to the whole creative m edium  for both hobbyist and professionals. AI should not under any circum stances be allowed
to steal the work of others. Unless it has the proper consent from  the party's whose work is being used for the training of AI. Anyone
work that has been used in the past without consent for AI needs to be properly credited and com pensated or have all prior data that is
and was used deleted.
