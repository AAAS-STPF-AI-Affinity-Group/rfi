General Comment
There are two kinds of artificial intelligence, and one of them  is useful, while the other is not.
AI is at its best when it parses and sorts through data quickly, and this is the kind of use that should be em phasized. However, even this
usage should be double-checked by hum ans.
Generative AI is m uch less useful, particularly when it "hallucinates" (or lies). AI is not a search engine, and it shouldn't be used to
synthesize answers.
Training the m odel for this usage also raises a num ber of concerns, including copyright and proper com pensation for those whose work is
used for training. It's also effective as a tool, but it shouldn't be used to take jobs away from  people.
Analytical AI with safeguards is the m ost reasonable use, but any action plan should consider the negative im pacts on creative work and
other areas.
