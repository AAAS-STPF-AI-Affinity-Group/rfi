General Comment
My nam e is Brandon King. Currently, I hold several occupations, but am ong them . I am  a m usician and part of a large com m unity of
independent artists, film m akers, painters and others.
I use this space to m ake clear that I do not support Open AI in the future of US policy, decisions and certainly not in the livelihoods of m y
m usician, film m aker and other artist friends and colleagues. 
I believe the technology has room  for ram pant exploitation of com m unities who I hold dear and who are already using every scrap of tim e,
energy and yes, m oney, to try to m ake the world a bit m ore interesting with their work. 
I will not, while I have som e sem blance of a voice, allow powers of higher influence than I ever will have to let AI developers and
softwares loose on artistic com m unities with no oversight, consequences or com pensation. 
Sim ply voicing this feels terrifying to attem pt, but I hope beyond anything else that you will take the words of one arts advocate and one
artist to heart, and know that I am  not alone in m y concerns.
Thank you for your tim e.
