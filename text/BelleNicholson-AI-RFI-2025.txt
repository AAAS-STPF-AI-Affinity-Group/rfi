Hello!
AI means a lot of things, but I'm going to focus comments my comments on
large language models, since that is what is typically meant when peopletalk AI. AI that isn't a large language model is going fine and I don'tthink we need to remove any barriers to it's development.
1. LLMs currently give wrong information a lot. If we're going to
continue making LLMs, then we need to focus on upping it's accuracy.That could mean being more selective on what data we train the model on.
2. LLMs currently use a lot of power. Like cryptocurrency, LLMs use an
insane amount of power. Resources should be dedicated to reducing theamount of power they use.
3. Right now, LLMs are being advertised to the public as a thing that is
trained on publicly available data and is available for public use. Thisnotoriously violates the copyright of artists and writers. Copyrightthat is granted under Copyright Act of 1976. I think it would be betterto focus LLMs as a tool that you use to train on your own work and thenuse to create work in your style. Maybe it can also be trained on thelarge amount of public domain available.
Thank you for listening.Best,Belle
