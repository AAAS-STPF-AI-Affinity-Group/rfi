General Comment
Generative AI directly steals from  and threatens the future prospects and career opportunities of m yself and m any of m y friends. We are
all m usicians, artists, and writers, and do not feel unregulated generative AI that has a free reign to scrape without boundaries has any
place in the creative com m unities and is, sim ply put, a poison.
