General Comment
As an freelance illustrator, m y business has been dram atically disrupted by the rise of generative AI. My incom e has been dropping
consistently every m onth for the last year and a half. There are less clients looking to hire hum an artists for work when they can use AI for
cheaper, even though they can't copyright work not created by a hum an. On top of that, these AI m odels have been trained on the work
of m yself and thousands of other artists, without perm ission, consent, or com pensation. This is a blatant violation of US copyright laws.
And the am ount of energy consum ed by these AI generators doesn't justify the use, as m ost people just use it to cut corners or purely for
entertainm ent. And as som eone who cares about the future of our planet, this is a m ajor issue for m e.There's so m any other problem s with
generative AI that I won't get into, but those are the m ain highlights.
