General Comment
If AI com panies want data sets, they need to pay for them . And they pay for them  by paying the rightful owner of the data. If you want to
include a photo to train your im age generator, pay for it. And you pay for it by paying the owner of the photo, not the owner of the site
where it happens to be posted.
