General Comment
Governm ent should not be helping corporations to use AI to ("train" and) steal from  Am ericans' livelihoods, nor profit off the theft of their
work. Those requirem ents - which are there to protect actual Am ericans and the work they produce - are necessary; the requirem ents are
not burdensom e; and they do not ham per private sector innovation. Any com pany or industry claim ing otherwise is crying wolf.
AI is overhyped (and it's definitely not intelligence in any sense), and taxpayer m oney m ust not be used to try to pull the wool over the
eyes of the Am erican public.
AI is not the future of the U.S.; actual Am ericans are.
