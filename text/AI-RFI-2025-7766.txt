General Comment
I am  writing to express m y enorm ous concern about the future of artistic expression in this country. If any AI com pany is given free reign
to use anyone's creation and content to "train" AI without perm ission or com pensation, the protections of copyright, tradem ark, and
sim ple ownership will vanish. AI does not have any "right" to people's creations, as it is not in any way a person or even a corporation. It
is, at best, a tool. If that tool needs to be fed people's creations to becom e useful, let those people decide, and com pensate them . If
som eone doesn't want their content used, they have the right to refuse. That's basic capitalism , and basic hum anity. Would anyone suggest
a com pany who creates a better m ousetrap is required to freely share that technology? Of course not. They have the right to profit from
their labor. In tim e, others m ight divine how they created it, and will produce copycat technology, but we do not allow it sim ply to be
stolen with the blessings of the law. AI can be a useful tool, but it.is not a necessity requiring the sm ashing of basic Am erixan values.
