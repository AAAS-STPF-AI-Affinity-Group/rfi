General Comment
As a writer whose work is available to read online, I do not consent to it being used to train AI that com panies have openly stated they
plan to use to directly com pete with hum an writers using the regurgitated recom bining of existing works. Those are derivative works by
definition. Copyright protects the rights and livelihoods of hum an creators. Few enough creators get their work noticed and paid for and
the last thing we need to do is flood the m arket with AI slop cobbled together from  the hard work of hum ans who have not been
com pensated for the use of their m aterial. Either they need to pay licensing fees for every creator whose work they want to use for their
training data, or cease and desist.
