General Comment
Do not do this. Please think about what this will do to all artists, all of art, forever. Understand that by doing this, thousands of real people
will have their life's work stolen from  them . This hurts artists m ore than anyone could possibly im agine. Artists need to be able to sue
m assive corporations that are outright stealing from  them .
