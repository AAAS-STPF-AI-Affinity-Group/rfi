General Comment
AI in its current form  has no place in the world to function as a helpful product. It is a m oney-sucking hole of a buisiness m odel that
requires illegal theft of copyrighted m aterial to train itself. 
Unlike photography, which is considered a transform ative, and self-expressive art form , AI requires insignifigant to no input on the
"artist"'s side. This m eans it is not a tool for artistry, but a tool against it. 
If AI is given the ability to create m aterial that is no longer effectly under open source, then m illions lose their jobs. Music, painting,
sculpting, designing, and m ore will all lose any form  of hum an touch. This is a horrific scenario to every artist with a shred of com m on
sense.
Do not let this pass.
