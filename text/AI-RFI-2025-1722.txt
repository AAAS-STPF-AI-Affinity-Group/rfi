General Comment
An industry propped up by m assive am ounts of copyright infringem ent and theft shouldn't have such a hold on our governm ent in the first
place, let alone as som e kind of nebulously defined m atter of national security or in the nam e of "global AI dom inance." Get this crap
under control first. If a system  or tool has to rely on m assive am ounts of THEFT, such that they have to openly BREAK THE LAW to
use it with any utility and the entire industry would be undone by the correct enforcem ent of copyright regulations in a court of law, then it's
a useless system  and I don't want it near any of the governm ent's data. Or anyone's data. Stop endorsing the invention of nonsense that
m akes everything harder and worse. Generative AI isn't even appreciably different from  what it was in the late 90s, you're just feeding it
with things the owners didn't give you perm ission to use.
