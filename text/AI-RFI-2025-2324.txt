General Comment
AI is a conm an's tech, with such abundant failure and false positive rates that it should not be trusted to give accurate inform ation in any
situation, regardless of the weight. Even the m ost basic testing shows that it can easily be convinced to drop safety guardrails by refram ing
questions as theoreticals, or by insisting that false inform ation is true until it incorporates that falsehood into its responses. 
As for generative AIs, the training data is stolen, and the "unnecessary burdens" that the executive order refers to are the legal rights of
Am erican citizens. Personal works protected under copyright and patent laws are not available for looting, and m edia piracy on a m uch
sm aller scale has a legal precedent of disproportionate consequence for private citizens. There is no reason why a business should not be
beholden to the sam e laws and precedent, and any reading of this executive order that would allow for such is likely illegal.
