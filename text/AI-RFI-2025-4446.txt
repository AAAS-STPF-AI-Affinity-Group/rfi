General Comment
AI "dom inance" is not som ething the US should even want. The widespread use of AI in every facet of our lives is wreaking ecological
havoc and destroying m any jobs in creative and service fields. It's also unspeakably annoying.
As an artist, I have never and would never give m y consent for m y work to be used as part of a m achine learning process. And yet, it has
happened because m y intellectual property rights were not taken seriously. I condem n any sim ilar course of action going forward in the
strongest possible language. If AI cannot flourish if it needs perm ission for and to pay for the m aterials that com prise the dataset, then it's a
waste of everyone's tim e and is theft besides.
I acknowledge the wide application of the term  "AI" and that som e non artistic and considerably sm aller and m ore precise applications for
sim ilar technology exist. I do not have anything against AI assisted cancer screenings, for exam ple. If we are to go forward in the field, that
is where em phasis should be.
But as for the artistic applications: paws off m y copyright.
