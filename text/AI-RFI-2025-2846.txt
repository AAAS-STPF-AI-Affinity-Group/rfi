General Comment
There's nothing like a hom e cooked m eal. Tireless hours in a kitchen, learning the right tim ing with spices and ingredients to create a bold
taste for yourself and others to love and enjoy. A hom e cooked m eal to a fast food quick fix is no com parison.
The quality not only m atters, but the driven passion and learning skills of a trade like art, of any kind, is fundam ental to society and
connection with the hum an race. If AI is allowed to freely steal others efforts, we will be left with nothing but em pty quality and hollowing
of hum anity. This isn't an exaggeration, please sit back and consider these words. They weren't written by AI, typing right now is a hum an
being with a passion and a plea: Our technology is surpassing our hum anity, where m oney and convenience is m ore sought after than
connection and the hum an experience.
Please reconsider for the value of quality, connection and efforts of creation.
