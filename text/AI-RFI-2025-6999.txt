General Comment
I do not believe generative AI will be beneficial for the US in the long run. It takes so m uch energy to run, the bubble will eventually pop,
and it steals the property of citizens with no plans to com pensate them . It's a form  of theft that will eventually stagnate as it begins to feed
on itself. It will not benefit citizens.
It also runs the risk of m ajor security concerns.
