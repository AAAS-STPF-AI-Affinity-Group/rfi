To Whom It May Concern,
Hello. I work in the tech industry, and I also spend time with artists and creatives with my
hobbies. I believe it is of the highest priority to ensure copyright protection of artists againstGenerative AI overreach.
 
To allow American artists' work to become unrewarded fodder for Generative AI would be thegreatest blow against U.S global dominance our nation has ever seen. 
Con Artists in California have convinced our country that we need to throw away American
supremacy in order to power their genAI promises. This is not true, and will only undoAmerican prosperity and the American values that we hold!
If we want to really Make America Great Again, we must become the strongest copyright
protector in the world.
Thanks,
Joshua Prila
