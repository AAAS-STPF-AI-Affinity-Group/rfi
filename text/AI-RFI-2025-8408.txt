General Comment
Generative AI is a hyped-up scam  sustained by theft. Its use erodes capacity for critical thinking in return for error-laden m isinform ation.
Consum ers overwhelm ingly do not want it. It is being forced on the Am erican public by a tech industry that knows it isn't wanted and
seeks to profit from  its predatory practices regardless. To legalize these practices despite copyright law and precedent is not only vile but
an outright betrayal of hum anity.
