General Comment
Hiya!
If the United States wants to m aintain its leadership in AI and technological innovation, it m ust abandon outdated intellectual property (IP)
m odels that are choking progress. The scarcity-based approach to innovation—where ideas are locked behind paywalls, patents, and
corporate silos—is not just inefficient, it’s a death sentence for U.S. com petitiveness in the 21st century.
The Inform ation Age has fundam entally changed the gam e. Unlike physical goods, knowledge is not depleted when shared—it grows. AI
thrives on open access to inform ation, and nations that em brace collaborative, open-source m odels are accelerating past those clinging to
proprietary system s. The European Union and China are investing heavily in open research ecosystem s, ensuring that their brightest m inds
have unfettered access to the tools they need to innovate. Meanwhile, the U.S. is stuck in an econom ic m odel where corporations hoard
knowledge like it's a finite resource, leading to stagnation instead of progress.
Let’s be real—capitalism  doesn’t work without com petition. But when a handful of com panies own the rights to critical AI m odels, they
aren’t com peting, they’re fortifying m onopolies. Innovation is being strangled under the guise of "protecting intellectual property," when in
reality, it's about locking out the next generation of startups, researchers, and students who could be building the future. If we don’t
reverse this, the U.S. will be outpaced by nations that are m aking their AI ecosystem s accessible rather than artificially scarce.
We need an AI Action Plan that em braces abundance, not scarcity, and that m eans:
Open Access to AI Research – Publicly funded research should not be privatized. If taxpayers pay for it, they should benefit from  it.
Reform ing IP Laws for AI – AI-generated work is not "intellectual labor" in the traditional sense. We need laws that encourage iteration
and im provem ent, not corporate ownership of algorithm s.
Investing in Open Education – Knowledge m ust be freely accessible. The U.S. is losing its STEM edge because students and researchers
are blocked from  essential inform ation by paywalls and licensing fees.
Preventing AI Monopolization – A few corporations should not control the infrastructure of knowledge. Break up anti-com petitive AI
m onopolies before they cem ent their dom inance.
Think about it: the internet, the ultim ate free-m arket accelerator, was built on open protocols. GNU/Linux dom inates global infrastructure
not because it was locked down, but because it was free to evolve. The m ost dynam ic, world-changing innovations did not com e from
walled gardens but from  open ecosystem s.
If we don’t adapt, we lose. Not to socialism , not to com m unism , but to the reality that knowledge econom ies cannot function under
scarcity m odels anym ore. If the US wants to stay ahead, it needs to get over its outdated fear of collective progress and start playing to
win.
