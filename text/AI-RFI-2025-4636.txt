General Comment
Generative 'AI' as it exists currently is a tool that relies on m ass plagiarism  in the form  of data scraped for training m odels. If any artistic
endeavor, whether by an individual or a corporation, is to have any recourse against the unwanted use of their work without com pensation
or even credit in return, gen-AI m ust be subject to copyright legislation at the m inim um . Otherwise, it will be im possible for people to
retain ownership of anything they expend their tim e and effort to create.
