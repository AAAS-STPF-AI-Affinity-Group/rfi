General Comment
Hi m y nam e is William . I have been working in the IT industry for over 4 years and have been involved with tech m y entire life. From  m y
first video gam e, building m y first PC, to getting a bachelors degree so I could pursue a career in tech. I, som eone who has grown up with
technology as it's advanced, revolved m y life around it for better or worse. Tech does not have our best interest in m ind, only our tim e and
data. Going forward with this action plan is in no one's interest except those who seek to profit from  not having to pay people. The effect
of allowing this type of plan to continue will be essentially digitally lobotom izing ourselves as a country.
