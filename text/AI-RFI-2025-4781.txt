General Comment
I am  an award-winning author of m ultiple books. My work has been stolen by generative AI com panies without perm ission to train their
plagiarism  m achines, and I find this outrageous. I am  far less bothered by ordinary piracy -- but the pirate sites are not by and large
dem anding a legal right to steal without consequence.
Generative AI is garbage, it produces garbage, and the statem ent that their business m odel only works if they can steal without
consequence should be treated as garbage. Generative AI steals from  authors and artists, but it also creates absolute m ountains of trash
that anyone looking for books, art, or inform ation now has to wade through. 
We need to m ove on from  generative AI, and the com panies hyping it should be told that they can sink or swim  but they can no longer
steal.
