General Comment
AI m ust be regulated in som e way, shape, or form  that protects the creative hum an people from  which it harvests its data. We can no
longer call things m ade by a m achine “art” and I believe it is a gross m isclassification. You m ade a collage, you m ade a picture. AI is the
absence of creativity. AI is the death of ingenuity. It will never be able to exist without artists and its existence as it is now loses our jobs.
Do you really want your kids to grow up on AI slop? Do you want your baby to be read a nursery rhym e created by an algorithm ? You
are soulless if you believe it can and should continue to rem ain unregulated.
