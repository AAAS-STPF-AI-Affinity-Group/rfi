General Comment
AI developed without consent of the creators of the work used is theft--we are stealing livelihoods from  authors, artists, scientists,
journalists, and m ore. Any regulations on AI need to include protections for those whose work is used to prevent it from  being used
without consent. Copyright infringem ent is illegal, including for use in developing AIs, and the US m ust keep it that way. 
I am  not sure why the current adm inistration regards the developm ent of "Safe, Secure and Trustworthy" AI to be a problem , but
regulations are necessary to m ake sure that we are considering the ethics of AI before plunging in blindly and ruining the incom es of
thousands of people. 
We have seen also num erous problem s with the developm ent of AIs that bring the biases of the hum an creators with them , and it is
incum bent on us to m ake sure this is addressed in any AIs being developed in the US.
