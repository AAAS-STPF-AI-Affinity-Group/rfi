General Comment
I am  lucky to have found out about the secret goings on of this bill when I did to voice m y outrage for m yself and thousands of other
hardworking artists who m ake an incom e off of the work they do. To pass a bill that allows AI software to legally STEAL a hum an beings
creation to “train” off of is deplorable and abhorrent. Som e stupid m achines should not have the right to steal som eone’s art and put a
person out of a job. Not to m ention, all AI creations I have seen thus far are disgusting in every sense of the word. It cannot nor will
EVER take the place of a hum an artist or authentically replicate what they do. This, to m e, is like som eone breaking into a house, stealing
a fam ily’s property, and leaving with no repercussions or consequences. Is THAT legal?? NO!! Nor should this bill be legal!! These fat
cats who want to pum p out m ore content faster to line their pockets need to keep far away from  artists, voice actors, and writers. It
sickens m e to see what this country is becom ing because of greed. I have m ade sure to share this around publicly so that others m ay
com m ent on the m atter. This bill is repulsive, repugnant, vile, and tasteless. I won’t let AI get its hands on real art m ade by hardworking,
talented people…MYSELF INCLUDED!!! STOP THIS BILL TODAY!!!
