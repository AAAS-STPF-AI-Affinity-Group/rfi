Dear AI Policy Team,
I am writing to strongly oppose any policy that allows AI companies to train models on copyrighted,
personal, or private data without explicit, informed consent. Companies like Google and OpenAI arepushing for such access, but this would be a massive violation of intellectual property and privacyrights.
Google is embedded in nearly every aspect of users’ digital lives—phones, computers, emails, andcloud storage. Allowing AI to scrape data without clear opt-in consent would be dangerous,unethical, and an abuse of users’ trust. Additionally, artists and creators are already losing jobs dueto AI models trained on their work without permission or compensation.
I urge the government to enforce strict protections, including:
• Mandatory opt-in consent before any data is used for AI training.
• Fair compensation for artists and creators.
• Strong privacy safeguards to prevent AI scraping personal data.
AI should serve humanity, not exploit it. Please ensure that the AI Action Plan prioritizes ethical AIdevelopment that respects creators’ rights and user privacy.
This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-proprietaryor confidential information. Document contents may be reused by the government in developing theAI Action Plan and associated documents without attribution.
Sincerely,
Maja Smoljanovi ć
