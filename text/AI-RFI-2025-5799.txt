General Comment
Hello,
AI com panies should not be given carte blanche to build and profit on stolen work. It is a cornerstone of the Am erican idea that the
people who create their work are the owners of their work. These com panies are parasites on the academ ic, creative, and any other
com m unity they seek to steal from  for no societal gain. These com panies m ust be forced to gain consent and com pensate the creator of
the work they wish to use. Copyright and other legal protections becom e closer to being m eaningless otherwise. 
Thank you
