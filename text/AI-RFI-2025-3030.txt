General Comment
A m achine stealing from  the people for the benefit of a corporation is dystopian. There’s a hum an behind that m achine stealing, if you
wouldn’t allow them  without the m ask of a m achine to steal then don’t allow them  with the m achine to steal.
And let’s be real, this AI isn’t going to be used to better our lives. It’s going to be the big brother everyone is fearing. The people are the
governm ents profit, that’s all this m achine is going to collect data for. The rich get richer of the labor of the poor. How long until the
governm ent starts using AI to sway the Am erican people against other people in foreign countries? Into wanting and justifying war? 
For once, care about the people you’re stealing from .
