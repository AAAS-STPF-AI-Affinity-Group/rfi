General Comment
If AI is allowed to be trained on people's creations without perm ission or com pensation it will destroy the value of the copyright. The
purpose of copyright is to protect people's work so that they can profit from  it and therefore they are m otivated to create such work. If
anyone can just go to the AI com pany and get a sim ilar work m ade in the creator's style, how and why would that creator continue
creating? They would be forced to go work in another industry.
This would be bad for the AI com panies as well. They depend on people creating in order to train their m odels. If people have no
incentive to create, they have nothing to train their m odels on.
Copyright should be enforced. Models should have to be trained on data that was obtained contractually.
