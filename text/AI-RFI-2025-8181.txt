General Comment
I am  Ethan Stanley. This docum ent is approved for public dissem ination. The docum ent contains no business-proprietary or confidential
inform ation. Docum ent contents m ay be reused by the governm ent in developing the AI Action Plan and associated docum ents without
attribution.
I have done work in the illustration industry, and AI has negatively im pacted m y livelihood because it seeks to ignore copyright to "learn"
from  m y work to m im ic and ultim ately replace m e. I have seen AIs that have been trained to m im ic specific hum an artists so closely that
they even m im ic the artists' signatures. Without safeguards, AI will negatively affect all creative industries including writing, illustration,
m usic, acting, video, and m ore.
The current generation of AI is overhyped. It is m assively expensive in term s of both m oney and energy, like one of the newest AI can
cost over $1000 per task [1]. It is prone to errors like depicting hands with extra fingers, telling users to eat rocks [2], or trying to
convince com panies to hire people just because they're nam ed Jared and played lacrosse [3]. A lawyer used AI to m ake court
docum ents, and it m ade a com pletely fictitious legal history [4]. The current generation of AI is not designed to be right, only to look and
sound right. It can be com pletely wrong while assuring you (or even arguing with you) that it is com pletely right. The future of Am erica
cannot be built on ridiculously expensive lying m achines.
AI advancem ents m ust com e ethically. The current generation of AI depends upon hum an-created works to learn from , but if "barriers"
are rem oved it will m assively discourage further hum an works and innovation. Who would take hours to create som ething if they know
that it would just be absorbed by a dozen AIs? AIs m ust respect copyright. They m ust require hum an workers to opt in to contributing
their works. Allowing hum an workers to opt out is unacceptable because there are num erous AIs and m ore every day, so opting out of
every single AI one by one would be a never-ending task. AI works m ust be labeled as such to help protect people from  m isinform ation
(like eating rocks or poisonous m ushroom s [5]) and to ensure that people know what they are really paying for (like AI books that
m isidentify m ushroom s).
Even ignoring the econom ic and em ploym ent im pacts, the current generation of AI depends upon hum an-created works to be the
backbone of their data. AI m odels can break down when they are trained using works created by other AIs [6]. AI works are flooding
websites and search engine results and m aking it hard to tell what is real and accurate. Even AIs need protection from  other AIs.
