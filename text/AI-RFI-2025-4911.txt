General Comment
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. It is a speculative solution to real problem s that should be left up to people, not
m achines scraping content everywhere and anywhere, including from  unverified and potentially dam aging sources.
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. The only thing AI has currently been used for in the tech sector is an
unrestricted bid to rem ove jobs and profit off the back of work created by others.
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
