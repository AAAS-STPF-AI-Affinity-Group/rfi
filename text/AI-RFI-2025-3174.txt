General Comment
I do not believe generative AI holds a place in the future of the United States. On top of being an overhyped technology that is causing
potentially irrevocably harm  to the environm ent, it is a blatant scam  that overtly steals the work and the livelihood of honest, legitim ate
artists. As an Am erican, I'm  disgusted by m any things the governm ent is currently doing (and even things it did during previous
adm inistrations), but this is one of the m ost offensive to m e as som eone who loves and values art.
