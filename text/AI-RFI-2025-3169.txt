General Comment
AI is over-hyped and is fleecing the Am erican public. AI is anything but intelligent and is polluting our databases by adding fictitiously
generated or dangerously incorrect inform ation to hundreds of years of history, research, and im ages.
As an illustrator, artist, and creator, AI steals from  m y livelihood and profits off of the work of m yself and m illions of other hardworking
Am ericans. It is being forced down our throats at every avenue, spying on our private m eetings and em ails, analyzing our personal photos,
and stealing work from  crafts that have taken us decades to hone.
Generative AI also requires such vast quantities of energy that it is guzzling our clean water reserves and burning out our power grids. 
AI is a danger to the Am erican people and I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
