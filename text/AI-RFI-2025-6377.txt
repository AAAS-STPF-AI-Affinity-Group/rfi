General Comment
AI is a joke. There is nothing good in it. It has no ethics. It is destroying our world. We spend m ore tim e fixing the errors. It is robbing
people of jobs and suppressing wages. I find it em barrassing we cannot rely on our own intellect to grow and im prove. I want artists and
creative to thrive without their work being fed into a m achine and ruined and replicated. There is no heart or soul in AI. Do your jobs.
Stop AI. We cannot be a lead when we are relying on the com puters to do the work. I spend every day wondering if I will lose m y job to
AI. I am  sick with stress and I can't sleep. Stop this. And stop it now. Stop listening to big tech and venture capitalists and private equity.
Value and protect the citizens. We cannot thrive with AI. It m ust die.
