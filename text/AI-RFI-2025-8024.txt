General Comment
AI is a horrible tool that has been introduced to our country. It has been m anipulated into creating false inform ation to trick innocent
individuals. It is harm ful for the m ental developm ent of our children and our country. It's used as a cover for big tech com panies to spy on
the public and steal their personal inform ation. It takes away the jobs of m any talented individuals and instead replaces them  with subpar
results that are stolen from  the work done by m any others. It destroys the livelihoods of those who create for a living, and destroys any
chance of them  having a future they can be proud of. AI steals copyrighted works and is not ethical to use under any circum stances. Its
use is illegal, and it should not be allowed to continue. AI should not be allowed to use the works of others.
