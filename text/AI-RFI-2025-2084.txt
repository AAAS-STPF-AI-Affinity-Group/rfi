General Comment
I absolutely believe we should be pushing hard against this, there is already so m uch shady and illegal scraping of the hard work of
creatives and various craftsm en, authors, artists and m usicians who rely on the internet to share their work. AI is a useless heap, a soulless
cash grab and throws creative people under the bus while am plifying scam s and falsehoods. Not only does it have no place in the
governm ent or anywhere else for that m atter, but its current application is genuinely a detrim ent to society. I'd like for us all to be able to
trust our own eyes and ears for the foreseeable future, this is not okay.
