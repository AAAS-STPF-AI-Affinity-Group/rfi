I am a concerned citizen of this country that does not have faith in this administration to do the
right thing. I am emailing to make sure my voice is heard, even though none of this will be takeninto consideration.
You've set out to create a plan for AI, but I'm pretty sure you couldn't care less about humanity
and the needs of everyday people. It seems that you would rather push this innovation withoutthinking about the repercussions it will have on society (as you've been doing with every othermove you've made thus far). So I have to ask the question, do you really think that humans willstill have a place if you don't put regulations on the building/enhancement of AI?
 
I can tell you right now that I highly doubt it. All of this crap about AI being a "thought partner" iscomplete BS, but like I said, I don't think you really care because I believe it is your goal toeliminate the majority of us so you can recreate society in some disgusting image (yep, I do meanwhite only) and only have the rich survive.
 
You all should actually listen to the people of this country and not that lunatic of "president" wehave.
