Re: AI Action Plan, Submission to the Office of Science and Technology Policy I am the Jonas Robitscher Professor of Law in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data 
Science, Emory University.
1 I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to OSTP’s call for policy ideas 
aimed at enhancing America’s global leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI).2  
My primary points in this submission are that if, contrary to precedent and sound policy, American 
courts rule that training AI models on copyrighted works is not permissible as fair use, the U.S. 
government must be ready to act. And furthermore, to maintain U.S. leadership in artificial 
intelligence, the AI Action Plan should explicitly affirm the importance of broad copyright exceptions—particularly fair use for nonexpressive activities like AI model training.  
How copyright law in various countries deals with AI training   
In “The Globalization of Copyright Exceptions for AI Training”  my co-author  Professor Peter Yu and I 
examine how copyright frameworks across the world have addressed the apparent tension between  
copyright law and copy-reliant technologies such as computational data analysis in the form of text 
data mining (TDM), machine learning and AI.
3 I have attached that article to this submission because 
it offers a broad survey of how different jurisdictions have addressed the issue.  
Our research reveals that , although the world has yet to achieve a true consensus on copyright and AI 
training, an international equilibrium has emerged. In this equilibrium, countries recognize that TDM , 
machine learning and AI training can be socially valuable and do not inherently prejudice the copyright 
 
1 I offer these comments my personal capacity only.  
2 For context , the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)  requested input on the Development of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan  to define the priority policy actions needed to sustain and enhance America's AI 
dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation.  See 
Exec. Order No. 14,179, 90 Fed. Reg. 8741 (Jan. 31, 2025) (Executive Order titled “Removing Barriers to American 
Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,” signed by President Trump ).

holders’ legitimate interests. Policymakers in the European Union, Japan, Israel, and Singapore agree 
in general terms that such uses should therefore be allowed without express authorization in some, 
but not necessarily all, circumstances.  
Major industrialized economies have found different ways to this equilibrium position. Some, like the 
U.S. and Israel have done so through the fair use doctrine. Others, like Japan, Singapore, and the 
European Union, have crafted express copyright exceptions for TDM and computational data 
analysis. Other nations where the rule of law is not so clearly established are energetically pursuing AI 
development with state backing without updated copyright laws to facilitate AI training. There is little 
doubt that if the Chinese Communist Party deems copyright law an impediment to its AI ambitions, 
the law in China will change almost instantaneously, and very likely retrospectively.  
U.S. litigation could unsettle global AI copyright norms 
American courts have historically recognized fair use protections for technologies relying on 
nonexpressive copying, such as reverse engineering,4 plagiarism detection software,5 digital library 
searches,6 and computational humanities research spanning millions of scanned texts.7 Extending this 
principle logically, training AI models—which similarly involves copying without directly reproducing expressive content—would usually qualify as fair use.
8 Yet, plaintiffs in more than 30 ongoing lawsuits 
across U.S. district courts contest this view.9 Collectively, they seek injunctions barring AI training 
without explicit consent, billions in monetary compensation, and even destruction of existing AI 
models.10 Although, in my estimation and that of many copyright experts,11 the plaintiffs are unlikely 
to prevail on sweeping arguments that would bring AI training in the U.S. to a halt , they might.12

Reuters Enter. Ctr. GmbH v. ROSS Intel. Inc., No. 1:20 -cv-613-SB, 2025 WL 458520 (D. Del. Feb. 11, 2025) . There are 
reasons to doubt that this opinion will set a precedent for generative AI more broadly, but it is a troubling development. 


A bad court decision may drive AI innovation offshore 
Adverse outcomes in U.S. litigation will not stop the development of AI, they will simply push AI 
innovation overseas. The reason is straightforward: AI models, once trained, are easily portable. 
Companies seeking to avoid restrictive copyright rules could simply move their training operations to innovation-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore, Israel, or Japan, and then serve U.S. customers 
remotely, entirely free of domestic copyright concerns.  
How is this possible? AI developers need fair use for all the copying that takes place to make training 
possible, but they don’t need fair use once the models have been trained because, by-and-large, trained 
AI models do not replicate the expressive details of their training datasets; instead, they distill general 
patterns, abstractions, and insights from that training data.
13 Thus, in the eyes of copyright law, these 
models are neither copies nor derivative works based on the training data. If U.S. copyright law turns 
against our AI industry, companies in the U.S. will still be able to use models trained in AI-friendly 
jurisdictions by either setting up a data pipeline so that the model stays overseas or  hosting their 
models in the United States once it has been trained. Consequently, imposing overly restrictive 
copyright interpretations domestically will do very little to turn back the tide on AI, but risks 
surrendering America’s AI advantage to more AI-friendly jurisdictions.  
Licensing deals are no substitute for fair use While licensing agreements between AI developers and media companies are becoming more 
common, they cannot solve copyright concerns surrounding AI training. The sheer scale of AI training 
data makes the licensing approach impractical at the cutting edge. For instance, Meta’s recent Llama 3 model consumed over 15 trillion ( 15,000,000,000,000) tokens drawn from publicly accessible 
sources. To put this into perspective, assuming that t he New York Times print edition is roughly fifty 
pages per day, each page has 4000 words, and there are 1.3 tokens per word, the newspaper would 
generate roughly 1.82 million tokens per week . At that rate , it would take about 158,500 years for the 
New York Times to generate 15 trillion tokens. Licensing at the scale required to train frontier LLMs 
is not a realistic foundation for American industrial policy, it is a fantasy. 
Nevertheless, existing deals with major media companies illustrate something important: AI developers are willing to pay for efficient access to high-quality datasets otherwise locked behind paywalls or machine-readable restrictions. Such agreements suggest that licensing has a niche but crucial role—not as a substitute for broad exceptions like fair use, but rather as a complementary 
source of premium training data. This dynamic becomes particularly valuable in AI-powered search 
scenarios, where language models frequently generate outputs closely resembling original copyrighted content, pushing the boundaries between acceptable use and potential infringement.

PROJECT  (Feb. 28, 2025),  https://project- disco.org/intellectual -property/scholars -agree -opinion- in-thomson -reuters-v-
ross-should- be-disregarded/. 
13 For a survey of situations where memorization of expressive content is more likely, and suggestions about what to do 
about it, see Matthew Sag, Copyright Safety for Generative AI , 61 H OUS. L. REV. 295 (2023) and the literature discussed 
therei n. Note that many AI companies have now adopted significant  copyright safety practices.  


The U.S. Government must be ready to act 
If, contrary to precedent and sound policy in my view, American courts rule that training AI models 
on copyrighted works is not permissible as fair use, the U.S. government should act. Specifically , the 
government would need to introduce legislation to reinstate the principle that training AI models 
typically falls under fair use or create a specific statutory exemption. I see no way this could be done 
through agency rulemaking or executive action. Legislative intervention would be necessary to 
safeguard America’s competitive edge against innovation-friendly jurisdictions like Japan, Singapore, Israel, and, in this context, even the European Union. 
To maintain U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, the AI Action Plan should explicitly affirm the 
importance of broad copyright exceptions—particularly fair use for nonexpressive activities like AI 
model training.

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
2 ABSTRACT  
Generative AI, machine learning , and other computational uses of  copyrighted works  pose profound questions 
for copyright law. This Article conducts a global survey of  multiple countries with different legal traditions and local 
conditions to explore how they have attempted to answer these questions in relation to the use of  copyrighted works for 
AI training without express permission  from the relevant rightsholders . Our survey suggests an emerging international 
equilibrium in which jurisdictions from around the world  have found ways to reconcile copyright law and AI training. 
In this equilibrium, countries recognize that text and data mining, computational data analysis , and AI training can 
be socially valuable and may not inherently prejudice the copyright holders’ legitimate interests. Such uses should therefore  
be allowed w ithout express authorization in some, but not all, circumstances.  
We identify three forces driving toward this equilibrium: (1) the centrality of  the idea -expression distinction  in 
copyright law ; (2) global competition in AI; and (3) the race to the middle  among countries undertaking copyright law 
reforms . However, we also address factors that may upset this emerging equilibrium, including ongoing copyright 
litigation, partnerships , and licensing deals in the United States as well as legislative and regulatory efforts in both the 
United States and the European Union, incl uding the adoption of  the EU A rtificial Intelligence  Act. 
A key lesson of  our cross -country survey is that , globally, the binary policy debate that assumes that text and 
data mining and AI training must be categorically condemned or applauded has been eclipsed by a more granular debate 
about the specific circumstances in which the un licensed  use of  copyrighted works for AI training should be allowed or 
prohibited. Countries that have hesitated until now to modernize their copyright laws in the area of  AI training have 
several templates open to them and little reas on for hesitation.

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
5 INTRODUCTION  
The arrival of  generative artificial intelligence (AI) has set the world on fire. China, the 
European Union, the United States, and other countries are actively engag ing in a race to advance and 
control cutting -edge AI technology , and generative AI in particular .1 Policymakers have called for 
hearings, listening sessions, and public comments to better understand the promises and perils of  AI , 
while  legislatures have introduced new regulation s to govern this new technology .2 Meanwhile , 
copyright holders have filed individual and class action lawsuits against generative AI developers , 
claiming  billions of  dollars in damages and calling for  the destruction of  AI models .3 In turn, 
generative AI developers have beg un to negotiat e partnerships and licensing deals with publishing 
houses and media conglomerates .4 
At the international level, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) launched a n 
initiative to address issues at the intersection of  intellectual property and AI.5 The U.N. Secretary -
General  created the High -Level  Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence to align AI development 
more closely with the needs of  humanity .6 Recent cross -border collaborations, including deals such as 
Microsoft’s investment in French startup Mistral AI7 and Google and Amazon’s investment in 
Anthropic ,8 raise concerns about power and concentration in increasingly intertwined  global 
technology markets.  
Amid  this great policy upheaval, we believe  it is worth considering whether AI disruption ha s 
brought the world’s major copyright systems closer together or driven them further apart. Countries

 6 have different legal traditions, economic conditions , technological capabilities, political systems, and 
cultural backgrounds.9 Their copyright laws understandably have varied origins , justifications, 
concepts, doctrines, and vocabularies .10 Meanwhile, issues relating to generative AI technology pose 
new conceptual challenge s to copyright law . A case in point is the use of  copyrighted works to train 
AI models  without express permission from the relevant rightsholders .11 
This Article explores whether copyright law has converged or diverged  globally in the area of  
AI training. Part I introduces the challenge posed by  the “nonexpressive use ” of  copyrighted works.12 
It explains why practices such as reverse engineering object code, checking student  papers for 
plagiarism, scanning library books to build a search engine index, subjecting entire libraries of  books 
to statistical analysis, and using text to train machine learning algorithms present something of  a puzzle 
for copyright law. This Part  explores how generative AI is similar to and different from prior 
nonexpressive uses.  
Part I I surveys three distinct groups of  jurisdictions : (1) those  with fair use provisions or close 
variants; (2) those  with express copyright exception s for text and data mining (TDM)  or computational 
data analysis ; and (3) those  actively pursuing AI development without updated copyright laws to 
facilitate  AI training. This Part argues that although the world has yet to achieve consensus on 
copyright and AI training, an international equilibrium has emerg ed. In th is equilibrium, countries 
recognize that TDM , computational data analysis,  and AI training can be socially valuable and may 
not inherently prejudice the copyright holders’ legitimate interests. Such uses should therefore be 
allowed without express authorization  in some, but not all, circumstances. On the issue of  copyright 
exceptions for AI training, countries have opted for a middle path , instead of  racing to the top or the

7 bottom.  Through a systematic analysis of  exceptions  across the world , we also show that some 
jurisdiction s provide greater scope for training AI and machine learning models than others.  
Part II I identifies three contributing factors to the emergence  of  an international equilibrium  
on copyright and AI training : (1) the centrality of  the idea -expression distinction  in copyright law ; (2) 
global competition in AI; and (3) the race to the middle  among countries undertaking copyright law 
reforms . Part I V outlines uncertainties  that may upset this emerging equilibrium. It discusses ongoing 
copyright litigation , partnerships , and licensing deals in the United States as well as  legislative and 
regulatory efforts in both the United States and the European Union, including the adopti on of  the 
EU Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act).13 Part V concludes with six key lessons drawn from our 
multi -country survey.  
I. THE NONEXPRESSIVE USE OF COPYRIGHTED  WORKS
Copyright  law was invented  in response  to the printing  press .14 Although  times  have changed,
the printing  press  remains  our dominant  metaphor  for how copyright  functions . Copyright  provides  
an incentive  to authors  whose  works  would  otherwise  be freely  copied  upon  first publication , and the 
reproduction  of a work  naturally serves as the locus  of exchange  between  the author  and the reader.  
But what if there  is no reader?  
In the 1990s,  for the first time,  we began  to see economically  significant  acts of copying  that 
had nothing  to do with communication  or transmission  of the underlying  expression.  Some  
prominent  examples  include  reverse  engineering  object  code,15 running  student  papers  through  
plagiarism -detection  systems,16 scraping  webpages  to build  a search  engine  index,17 doing  likewise with 
library  books,18 and conducting  meta -analysis  of entire  libraries  of books.19 These  nonexpressive  uses 
pose a difficult  conceptual  question  for copyright  law: the centerpiece  of copyright  law is the exclusive  
right to reproduce  the work , yet the purpose  underpinning  that right is to allow  the author  to control  
the communication  of his or her original  expression  to the public  while  still allowing  ideas,  facts,  
abstractions , and artistic  methods  to be freely  copied.20 Whether  and how copyright  law should  allow

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
 8 for nonexpressive  uses is a critically  important  question  for a variety  of technologies —most  salient ly 
machine  learning  and generative  AI.  
The term AI broadly encompasses computer systems that replace  the need for human  
perception  or judgment  in a particular  domain.21 Most of what we now think  of as AI is performed  
by some  kind of machine  learning.22 Machine  learning  models  make  predict ions and classifications  
based  on patterns  distilled  from  the training  data without  being  preprogrammed  with any explicit  
theory.23 For instan ce, a machine  learning  model  trained  to distinguish  between  medical  scans  of 
patients  with and without  cancer  can achieve  high rates of accuracy  without any understanding of  
human anatomy and without  anyone  suggesting  which  features  to look for.24 
Section A discusses the concept of  the nonexpressive use of  copyrighted works as it applies 
to AI and machine learning . This section situates generative AI in a series of  technologies that raised 
similar copyright questions in the past  and shows how this new technology aligns with previous 
nonexpressive uses . Section B  considers the potential distinctions between AI -related nonexpressive 
uses and earlier nonexpressive uses involving TDM . This section provides the background needed for 
an extended discussion  of  copyright exceptions for AI training from around the world as well as the

9 Although  we are still a long way from  the science  fiction  version  of artificial  general  
intelligence  that thinks,  feels,  and refuses  to “open  the pod bay doors ”, . . . [w]e now

Amid  great  optimism  about  our generative  AI future  are many  fears:  AI trained  on a flawed  
society  may exacerbate  and perpetuate  historical  biases;28 AI tools  may be misused  to generate  
misinformation  and biological  weapons;29 generative  AI may abruptly  displace  the need for human  
labor  in fields  ranging  from  legal practice  to graphic  arts;30 and, ultimately,  today’s  generative  AI models  
may be precursors  to super -intelligent  systems  that are not aligned  with the best interests  of 
humanity.31 If concerns  about  AI’s existential  risks or optimistic  projections  of our AI-enabled  future  
have any merit,32 one might  ask why copyright  issues  feature  so prominently  in current  policy

10 discussions . The answer  is that, while  copyright  may not be the most  important  issue in relation  to 
generative  AI, the copy-reliant33 nature  of generative  AI guarantees  copyright  law a seat at the table.  
To appreciate  the copyright  issues  at stake  in current  debates  over generative  AI necessitates  
at least a basic  understanding  of how models  are trained.  Our discussion focuses on text -based LLMs 
for narrative convenience.34 The first step in training  an LLM  is to collect  and analyze  a staggering  
quantity  of training  data.35 Present ly, the majority  of that data is invariably  scraped  from  the Internet  
and stored  on servers  where  it can be analyzed,  deduplicated,  and filtered  for toxic  and inappropriate  
content.36 The desired  training  data is then converted  into “tokens ” represented  by numbers that 
correspond  to words , parts  of words , and various  punctuation  marks.37 
There  are two critical  observations  about this preliminary part of  the training process.  First,  
downloading  copyrighted  works  from  the Internet  and storing  them  on a server  for more  than a 
transitory  duration  is clearly  an act of reproduction  under  U.S. copyright  law.38 Likewise,  converting

technologies) . 
34 Not every generative AI model is an LLM, nor is every LLM confined to text inputs and outputs or dependent on the 
transformer architecture. The current leading foundation models, such as Google’s Gemini, Meta’s Llama -3, and OpenAI’s 
GPT4o, are multimodal m odels.  See GPT-4, OPENAI, https://openai.com/index/gpt -4-research/ (last vis ited Feb. 6,

state for ‘more than transitory duration.’ .  . . But the creation of semipermanent stored copies, which appears to be

 11 that text into numerically  represented  tokens  is also an act covered by the law  because  those  numerical  
representations  could in theory be easily  reversed  into something  human -readable.39 
Second,  there  is something  special  about  these  copies —no one is likely to ever see or read 
them.  What  then becomes  of these  unread invisible  copies?  Once  training  data has been appropriately  
filtered  and tokenized , it can be used to train an AI model .40 A “large”  language  model  typically  
comprise s billions  or trillions  of parameters .41 At the beginning  of training,  these  parameters  are each 
assigned  an arbitrary  weight.42 During  training,  the model  is exposed  to sequences  of tokens  from  the 
training  data and instructed  to predict  the next most  likely  token.43 We can elide some  fascinating  
computer  science  by simply  summarizing  that the relevant  guess es are then evaluated,  and the model  
weights  are adjusted  accordingly.44 The initial  guesses  are almost  invariably  gibberish,  but after a great  
many  rounds  of training , the model  begins  to make  better  and better  predictions.45 This training  
process  culminates  with a “pre-trained”  model  which  explains  the acronym  “GPT ,” which  stands  for 
“generative  pre-trained  model. ”46 Despite  the astonishing  abilities  and apparent  versatility  of  these 
models , a model  like GPT -4o only does one thing : it predicts  the next token  in a sequence  of tokens.47 
However,  when  each new token  becomes  part of the background  sequence  for the next prediction,  
prediction  becomes  generation.48 After  all, even Shakespeare  wrote only one word  at a time.  
 
39 For something to constitute a “copy” of a work under the relevant definition in Section 101 of the Copyright Act, it 
must embody the work in a form that is permanent or stable enough to be perceived, reproduced , or communicated “either 
directly or with the aid of a machine or device. ” 17 U.S.C. § 101. Works transformed into tokens may appear to be 
unreadable, but the tokenization process can be easily reversed . Thus, these numerical  representations  can be read “with 
the aid of a machine or device ” and meet the statutory definition of copies.

 12 Generative  AI models  are not designed  to memorize  their training  data.49 In general,  these  
models  are significantly  smaller  than the volume of information they are exposed to.50 This setup  
forces  the model  to learn  at a somewhat  abstract  level,  rather  than through  memoriz ation .51 By deriving  
abstractions  and heuristic s from  the training  data, generative  AI models  improve at responding  to new 
inputs , allow ing them to navigate the latent space implied by the data rather than simply remixing and 
reproducing the data as output .52 This design has important  implications  for copyright  law. 
To begin  with,  so long as the model  has not memorized  a particular  work,  it does not include  
a copy of that work.53 This fact alone  does not address  the issue of  copying data used to train the 
model, but it is critical to understand that the model and the training data are quite separate things. 
Furthermore,  if a generative  AI model  is not a copy of the relevant  training  data, the digital  artifacts  
produced  by that model  will not be copies  of the data. We do not deny the attenuated  causal  link 
between  training  data and model output s.54 We simply  note that if one created  outputs  through  a 
process  that did not involve  creating  invisible  intermediate  copies,  those outputs  would  fail the 
traditional  test of substantial  similarity  in copyright law .55 If  someone  asks ChatGPT to tell a bedtime 
story about a hard-boiled detective bear liv ing in Helsinki,56 the resulting story will owe something to 
the works of  Dashiell Hammett , but it will not be an infringing copy of  The Maltese Falcon57 because

13 literary style and genre are not protectable aspects of  copyright.58 Nevertheless , some  researchers have 
found generative  AI models  to memorize  significant parts of  particular  works  in the training  data59 or 
learn  enough  about  the subject  matter  protec ted by copyright  law at a higher  level of abstraction , such 
as copyrightable  fictional characters.60 Such memorization suggests a real possibility of  copyright 
infringement . 
Machine learning and generative AI raise a vital  copyright  question  for jurisdictions  around  
the world : should  it be permissible  to create  hidden  intermediate  copies  of copyrighted  works  that no 
one will ever see or read , so that a statistical  model  can learn  uncopyrightable  and abstract  features  of 
those  works ? Intuitions about th is question turn on the relative  importance  one assigns  to the mere  
fact that a technical  act of copying  has occurred , as opposed  to the purpose  and effect  of that technical  
reproduction.  Even  taking the view that copyright  should  permit  some  nonexpressive  uses, subsidiary  
questions  arise. These questions  includ e whether  it matters  if uncopyrightable  and abstract  features  
derived  through  machine  learning  remain  as abstract  metadata  and whether  they are used to produc e 
new and different  digital  artifacts —if  so, whether  generative  AI deserves special rules that differ  from  
those applied to other  forms  of machine  learning  and TDM . 
B. Potential Distinctions  Between AI Training and TDM
For a long time , and  in many different contexts , researchers have used computational
processes and statistical methods to discover new information and reveal patterns in unstructured text 
data, usually referred to as TDM or computational data analysis .61 The growing importance of TDM 
as a method of discovery in computer science, the life sciences, literary criticism, linguistics, history , 
and other disciplines  has spurred many proposals for legislative change.62 Indeed, countries  began 
addressing the copyright implications of  nonexpressive use in relation to TDM in the late 2000s .63 At

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
 14 that time, the logic of viewing nonexpressive use as fair use under U.S. law was already apparent, but 
the case law was hardly as well defined as it is today.64 
Although the copyright implications of  machine learning seemed indistinguishable from other 
forms of  TDM prior to generative AI,65 there are notable differences between machine learning and 
generative AI. First, generative AI does not simply analyze training data to derive useful information ; 
it can produc e digital artifacts in the same form as its training data.66 Even if  the outputs do not 
approach substantial similarity —the threshold for copyright infringement —they may nonetheless 
compete directly with the works used to train AI models  or with the copyright holders  of  th ose 
works .67 In the United States, this prospect of  indirect substitution could complicate the fair use 
analysis with respect to the fourth factor, “the effect of  the use upon the potential market for or value 
of  the copyrighted work.”68 In jurisdictions  whose copyright laws have incorporated the “three -step 
test”69—a framework laid out in key international intellectual property instruments for  determin ing 
the acceptability of  copyright limitations and exceptions70—such prospect  may also influence the 
assessment of  whether  the use would “unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of  the right 
holder”  (the last step of  the three -step test ).71 
Second, as noted above , some generative AI models  have been shown to occasionally 
reproduce digital artifacts with more than a passing resemblance to particular works in their training

 15 data.72 On such occasions, any argument that the work reproduced was used in a transformative or 
nonexpressive fashion becomes strained.  
Understanding these potential distinctions will be important as we explore the international 
copyright law developments in the area of  AI training in the next Part. Copyright holders who filed 
lawsuits against generative AI developers, as well as their sup portive policymakers and commentators, 
have also utilized these potential distinctions to support their arguments and to push for their 
preferred copyright law reforms .

our focus on cross -country comparison s. Section A examines  those jurisdictions with fair use 
provision s or close variant s. Section B turns to jurisdictions with express copyright exception s for 
TDM or computational data analysis. Section C covers countries actively pursuing AI development 
without updated copyright laws to facilitate AI training.  
A. Fair Use and Its Close Variants  
Most commonly associated with U.S. copyright law,73 the term “fair use” is generally used to 
refer to an open system of  copyright limitations and exceptions.74 Such open -endedness is especially 
attractive for “creating a positive environment .  . . for innovation and investment in innovation,”75 
including in the AI sector. Many policymakers and commentators have also credited the fair use 
provision for the success of  U.S. technology companies , such as Google and Facebook (now Meta) .76 
Today, a growing number of  countries have adopted or considered the fair use regime or its close

16 variants.77 This section first discuss es the fair use regimes in the United States and Israel before turning 
briefly to other fair use regimes around the world.  
1. United States  and Israel
In the United States, t he doctrine of  fair use was originally judge -made but later codified in
Section 107 of  the 1976 Copyright Act.78 In Israel , that doctrine also first emerged in case law  before 
codification.79 In 2007 , the country adopted a statutory  provision  that closely track ed the text and 
structure of  the U.S. fair use provision .80 Because of  the remarkable similarities between the se two 
provisions, this section discuss es them together . 
Our view of  American law is based on how courts have treated analogous technologies using 
the four fair use factors  provided in Section 107 —namely, (1) “the purpose and character of  the use ”; 
(2)“the nature of  the copyrighted work ”; (3) “the amount and substantiality of  the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole ”; and (4) “the effect of  the use upon the potential market
for or value of  the copyrighted work .”81 In contexts ranging from reverse engineering software to text
mining millions of  library books , U.S. courts have consistently held that technical acts of  copying that
do not communicate an author’s original expression to a new audience constitute  fair use.82 By
contrast, courts have found no fair use in seemingly  analogous cases where the challenged conduct
appeared to have exceed ed the limits of  nonexpressive use  and communicated significant expressive
material to a new audience .83
The Ministry of  Justice of  Israel reached similar conclusion s in its advisory opinion entitled 
Uses of  Copyrighted Materials for Machine Learning  (“MOJ Opinion ” or “Opinion” ).84 Responding to the

 17 Ministry of  Defense’s query concerning the flagship Government program for AI infrastructures  that 
was not directed  to any specific contested facts, the Opinion  explains the necessity of  copying large 
volumes of  text and other copyrighted works for AI training.85 It further notes that in the ordinary 
course, “each individual work is a single component in an enormous dataset and holds an immaterial 
weight in the dataset.”86 The Opinion presumes that the purpose of  developing AI systems is not to 
produce digital artifacts that closely resemble the training data.87 Instead , it is premised on machine 
learning training qualifying as a nonexpressive use.88 Based on this premise , the Opinion concludes  
that “the fair use doctrine .  . . typically permits the creation of  [machine learning] datasets.”89 
Allowing  genuinely nonexpressive uses make s sense in terms of  the four statutory fair use 
factors  in both the United States and Israel . With respect to the first factor  under U.S. copyright law , 
analyzing existing works to derive metadata or uncopyrightable abstractions and associations is 
“quintessentially transformative ,” and the use can be justif ied in terms of  its “purpose and character .”90 
The mere fact that these abstractions and associations are used to generate new expression s should 
not diminish their transformative nature so long as th ose expression s are not substantially similar to 
the training data.  After  all, creating new expression s is the goal of  copyright.91 In Israel, t he MOJ 
Opinion agrees, noting that “such use is as transformative as it gets” so long as the system does not 
“produce outputs that would highly resemble their inputs.”92  
Given that such nonexpressive uses are highly transformative, the commercial nature of  much 
AI development is unlikely to weigh against fair use.  In the United States, t he Supreme Court’s recent 
foray into fair use in Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts , Inc. v. Goldsmith  drew attention to 
commerciality, but the majority in that decision reiterated the holding in Campbell v. Acuff -Rose Music, 
Inc.93 that commerciality “is to be weighed against the degree to which the use has a further purpose 
 
Opinion is not binding on courts, it is expected to weigh heavily on the ir approach to cases involving alleged infringement 
through  TDM. See Jonathan Band, Israel Ministry of Justice Issues Opinion Supporting the Use of Copyrighted Works for Machine

 18 or different character ”94 and that “t he more transformative the new work, the less will be the 
significance of  other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of  fair use.”95 
The view in Israel is th e same.96 The MOJ Opinion notes  that “the paradigmatic case of  
[machine learning] dataset meets the [purpose and character] criterion . . . , given its societal value and 
transformative nature.”97 The Opinion nonetheless cautions that commercial uses where the enterprise 
is not transformative  are less likely to be fair use .98  
The highly transformative nature of  nonexpressive AI training may further  influence the 
analysis of  the remaining factors.  The second fair use factor, which directs courts to consider “the 
nature of  the copyrighted work, ” has not been influential in fair use cases involving other 
nonexpressive  uses.99 One of  us has even suggested that the nature of  the work is not truly a factor 
at all; it merely provides the factual context in which the other factors are evaluated.100 Consistent with 
U.S. case law, the MOJ Opinion in Israel places little weight on the difference between a more creative 
work and a more factual work in the machine learning context.101 
Under U.S. copyright law, t he third factor, “the amount and substantiality of  the portion 
used,”102 favors defendants in nonexpressive use cases because the ultimate question there is whether 
the amount of  copying is reasonable in relation to a purpose favored by fair use.103 Our assessment 
of  U.S. copyright law is echoed in the MOJ Opinion in Israel , which states  that although the works in 
the training data are usually copied in full, such complete reproduction is necessary to extract 
unprotected elements like facts and ideas and derive new observations from the training data.104 In 
both jurisdictions , making complete literal copies is reasonable as an intermediate technical step in an

19 analytical process that does not lead to communicati ng the underlying original expression to a new 
audience.105 
Finally, based on the fourth factor in the U.S. fair use provision, u sing copyrighted works as 
training data for the development of  AI models is unlikely to have a cognizable effect on the “potential 
market for or value of  the copyrighted work ,”106 so long as the use is nonexpressive. This assessment 
may seem odd given the benefits commercial AI developers  have derive d from access to other people’s 
works ; but allowing such benefit s tracks the fundamental commitment in copyright law to drawing a 
distinction between copyrightable expression s and uncopyrightable facts, ideas, styles, and 
abstractions.107 The “market” and “value” addressed in the fourth factor does not include a right to 
prevent quotations in critical book reviews or allegations of  plagiarism, even if  th ose quotations  would 
cause economic harm.108 Moreover, courts have generally rebuffed circular arguments that copyright 
holders  have a right to charge for nonexpressive uses  because not being able to charge for such uses 
is a market harm under the fourth factor .109 
In Israel, t he MOJ Opinion makes a strong but nuanced case for AI training in terms of  the 
fourth factor. It recognizes the lack of  a present market for training data at the scale required for 
LLMs but concedes that such a market, were it to develop, could modify the application of  the fair 
use doctrine.110 Section  IV.A.2 will discuss further whether recent licensing deals for access to training 
105 See, e.g. , Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202, 221 (2d Cir. 2015) (“Complete unchanged copying has

transformative purpose and was done in such a manner that it did not offer a competing substitute for the original.”);

the [HathiTrust Digital Library] to make use of the entirety of the w orks in order to enable the full -text search function, 
we do not believe the copying was excessive.”).

law.”).

 20 data may differentiate future generative AI cases from otherwise analogous cases such as Authors Guild, 
Inc. v. HathiTrust111 and Authors Guild v. Google , Inc. (Google Books ).112 
Our reading of  existing U.S. case law is that nonexpressive  uses pose no direct threat of  
expressive substitution and should generally be considered harmless under the fourth factor. However, 
that factor leaves room for considerations beyond direct expressive substitution.113 Such considerations 
may include  whether a  defendant  failed to adopt adequate security measures, accessed works by 
circumvent ing paywalls or disregard ing robots.txt exclusions , and exploited caches of  material on sites 
of  known infringement .114 We note that each defendant in the nonexpressive use cases decided to date 
had lawful access to works copied. U.S. courts have not yet had a chance to consider scenarios where 
the works put to a nonexpressive purpose had first been copied unlawfully.115 
The MOJ Opinion in Israel does not directly address these questions , but it suggests that fair 
use would not protect copying for a machine learning application that was “designed to mimic the 
style [of] a single author,” due to the lack of  sufficient transformativeness and the fact that such 
copying would pose too great a prospect of  market harm.116 
2. Other  Jurisdictions  
The United States and Israel are not alone in adopting fair use. Liberia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan have made similar choices,117 and many 
of  these jurisdictions did so at around the same time when Japan, the United Kingdom, and the

Four only when the use serves as a substitute for the original and the full -text-search use does not.”).  
112 See Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d at 223 (2d Cir. 2015) (framing the question as “whether the copy brings to 
the marketplace a competing substitute for the original, or its derivative, so as to deprive the rights holder of significant  
revenues because of the likelihood that potent ial purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original”).

will discuss.118  
Despite criticisms by some policymakers, commentators, and industry representatives that U.S. 
fair use jurisprudence is incoherent in theory and unpredictable in application,119 many countries have 
recognized that fair use has allowed U.S. copyright law to adapt more rapidly and effectively to the 
challenges of  the digital age.120 Although not all of  these jurisdictions ended up incorporating fair use 
or a similar open standard into their copyright regimes ,121 all of  them have recognized —in legislative 
proposals, consultation reports, or other documents —that the fair use doctrine ha s given the United 
States a distinct technological advantage in developing copy-reliant technologies such as  Internet 
search.122 
B. Express Exceptions for TDM or Computationa l Data Ana lysis 
Unlike the United States and other countries  with a fair use provision or its close variant , many 
jurisdictions have a closed system of  copyright limitations and exceptions.123 Under this arrangement, 
the copyright exception will only be available if  the conduct at issue fits within a specified category , 
such as  TDM or computational data analysis.124 That the exception is express does not mean that 
courts will not undertake a balancing exercise, such as analyzing the four factors found in a fair use

sources claiming that fair use is unpredictable). For contrary views, see generally  Michael J. Madison, A Pattern -Oriented

right holder .”126 As Michael Geist observe s in regard to the distinction between fair use and a n express 
copyright exception such as fair dealing: “The [fair dealing] model creates a two -stage analysis: first, 
whether the intended use qualifies for one of  the permitted purposes, and second, whether the use 
itself  meets the fairness criteria. By contrast, fair use raises only the second -stage analysis,  since there 
are no statutory limitations on permitted purposes. ”127 
1. Japan
Japan was the first country to create an express exception to reduce the tension between TDM  
and copyright  protection . In July 2009, Japan amended its Copyright Act by adding an exception 
supporting TDM or computational data analysis.128 A decade later , Japan expanded th at provision and 
combined it with Article 30 -4129 to cover  the use of  a copyrighted work “in any way and to the extent 
considered necessary” when “it is not [the user’s] purpose to personally enjoy or cause another person 
to enjoy the thoughts or sentiments expressed in that work.”130 Explicitly listed  in the amended  
provision are three covered activit ies: (1) “testing [technology] to develop [it] or put [ting technology ] 
into practical use”; (2) “data analysis”; and (3) “computer data processing.”131 The new Article 30 -4 
bears a strong resemblance to the German civil law concept of  Freier  Werkgenuss  (free enjoyment of  a 
copyrighted work).132

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
23 Because Article 30 -4 of  the Japanese Copyright Act was broadly drafted to cover any use that 
does not result in  the enjoyment of  a copyrighted work or facilitat e such enjoyment, the provision is 
no longer  a narrow exception for TDM or computational data analysis but a broad one for 
nonexpressive use.133 Even though the exception was drafted before the arrival of  generative AI, it 
cover s the use of  copyrighted works for AI training.134 Applying to commercial and noncommercial 
uses alike, this sweeping exception  is subject to a general limitation that the use must not 
“unreasonably prejudice the interests of  the copyright owner in light of  the nature or purpose of  the 
work or the circumstances of  its exploitation,”135 language draw n from the last step of  the three -step 
test mentioned above .136 
In addition to Article 30 -4, Japan introduc ed Article 47 -5, which provides a new copyright 
exception for the “minor exploitation incidental to computerized data processing and the provision 
of  the results thereof.”137 Working in tandem , these two provision s gave Japan arguably the world’s 
broadest exception for TDM  or computational data analysis . It is therefore small  wonder  that 
Tatsuhiro Ueno notes that “Japan could be said to be a ‘paradise’ for machine learning and TDM.”138 
Notwithstanding this pro -AI development, policymakers and legislators have consider ed ways 
to tighten Article 30 -4, due largely to concerns about the challenges posed by generative AI. For 
example, in May 2024 , the Council for Cultural Affairs of  Japan published a nonbinding report entitled 
General Understanding on AI and Copyright in Japan , which outlines  circumstan ces in the AI context that 
would  and would not constitute the nonenjoyment of  “the thoughts or sentiments  expressed in [the 
copyrighted] work ,” including circumstances that would result in the simultaneous enjoyment and 
nonenjoyment of  that work.139 The document suggests that businesses c ould be held liable if  they 
that “[a]n independent work created in the  free use of the work of another person may be published and exploited without 
the consent of the author of the work  used.” Urheberrechtsgesetz [UrhG] [Copyright Act], § 24( 1) (repealed 2021) (Ger.).  
This provision has since been repealed. See Case C -476/17, Pelham GmbH v. Hütter, ECLI:EU:C:2019:624, ¶¶ 56 –65 
(July 29, 2019) (finding that the provision was inconsistent with Article 5 of the EU Directive on the Harmonisation of 
Certain Aspects of Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society (InfoSoc Directive)) .

would “unreasonably prejudice the interests of  the copyright holder” under Article 30 -4 if  they 
reproduce for AI training copyrighted databases that have available licenses and whose use has been 
restricted by tech nological protection measures  (TPMs) .141 
2. United Kingdom  
The United Kingdom’s TDM  exception was inspired by the 2011 Hargreaves Review , which 
addressed the failure of  UK intellectual property law to keep pace with technological advancements.142 
The report specifically noted that the legal barriers to using TDM technologies could hinder scientific 
discovery and innovation and recommended that the United Kingdom facilitate access to TDM for 
noncommercial research by making it clear that such activity  does not infringe copyright.143 
In May 2014 , the United Kingdom enacted a narrow TDM exception .144 Section 29A of  the 
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 provides that it is not an infringement to copy a work so 
that “a person who has lawful access to the work may carry out a computational analysis of  anything 
recorded in the work for the sole purp ose of  research for a non -commercial purpose.”145 In addition 
to the limitations on “sole purpose,” “lawful access,” “research,” and “non -commercial purpose ,”146 
the provision is contingent on “sufficient acknowledgement” where practical and limitations on 
transfer of  copies and subsequent dealing with copies147—a requirement found in other UK fair 
dealing provisions .148 Within this narrow scope, however, those ta king advantage of  the UK TDM 
exception  are immunized from contractual override —that is, private agreements not to engage in 
TDM  research permitted under the law will have no legal effect.149

 25 In 2022, the United Kingdom expressed its intention to expand  the TDM exception to cover 
commercial uses.150 The plan, however,  was abandoned a year later.151 
3. European Union  
The Directive on the Harmonisation of  Certain Aspects of  Copyright and Re lated Rights in 
the Digital Single Market (DSM Directive) was adopted in April 2019 to modernize EU copyright law, 
promote cross -border access and market integration for digital goods and services, and balance the 
interests of  various stakeholders in the digital economy.152 At the time of  the passage  of  this Directive , 
one of  its less prominent and least controversial aspects was the twin TDM provisions.153 In broad 
terms, Article 3 of  the Directive establishes a far -reaching exception for TDM by “research 
organizations and cultural heritage institutions,” whereas Article 4 provides a more qualified exception 
that is open to all.154 Article 3 allows, for instance , a researcher working at a university to reproduce 
and store lawfully accessed works for TDM carried out for “purposes  of  scientific research .”155 
Because Article 4 is not confined to “research organizations and cultural heritage institutions” or 
“purposes of  scientific research,” it is natural, if  somewhat imprecise, to think of  Article 3 as the not -
for-profit, institutional, and research -focused exception and Article 4 as the commercial TDM 
exception.156 Although the DSM Directive does not discuss machine learning as such, there is little 
doubt that the exceptions in Articles 3 and 4 extend to all forms of  TDM, including machine learning

153 Other more controversial issues included Articles 15 and 17 of the Directive. See id. art. 15 (offering “[p]rotection of 
press publications concerning online uses”); id. art. 17 (regulating “[u]se of protected content by online content -sharing 
service providers,” including filtering and licensing obligations).  
154 Id. arts. 3, 4. EU Directives are intended to take effect through national implementing legislation. Once the deadline of 
national implementation has passed, other EU members can challenge noncompliance with these directives before the 
Court of Justice of the European Union. The deadline for implementing the DSM Directive was June 7, 2021.  
155 Id. art. 3.  
156 The DSM Directive defines “research organisation” and “cultural heritage institution” to exclude primarily profit -
motivated entities. Id. art. 2(1 ), (3). 


THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
26 and generative AI.157 A recent German copyright case involving  the LAION image database used for 
training AI models confirms as much.158  
Article 3 requires  EU members to allow “for reproductions and extractions made by research 
organisations and cultural heritage institutions in order to carry out, for the purposes of  scientific 
research, text and data mining of  works or other subject matter to which they hav e lawful access.”159 
The research exception in Article 3 is immune from contractual override160 and is only subject to the 
TPMs deployed by right sholders to the extent necessary to “ensure the security and integrity of  the 
networks and databases” hosting  the protected works.161 Accordingly, the research exception is not 
subject to any express requirement to comply with rightsholder opt -outs. In contrast, the commercial 
TDM exception provided  by Article 4 is not immune from contractual or technological override162 
and is expressly subject to the condition that the relevant TDM use “has not been expressly reserved 
by their rightholders in an appropriate manner, such as machine -readable means in the case of  content 
made publicly available online.”163 Copyright holders therefore have the ability to opt out of  
commercial TDM .164 
The EU blueprints for research and commercial TDM exceptions also diverge somewhat on 
the retention and storage of  copies made in the course of  TDM analysis. Article 3 allows copies to 
“be retained for the purposes of  scientific research, including for the verification of  research results ,” 
157 This coverage was fairly clear from the definition of TDM in Article 2(2) , which speaks to “ any automated analytical 
technique aimed at analysing text and data in digital form in order to generate information which includes but is not limited  
to patterns, trends and correlations. ” Id. art. 2(2). It was made even clearer by the express linkage of Art icle 4(3) of the 
DSM Directive  to the training of general -purpose AI models in Article 53(1)(c) of the EU AI Act. See id. art. 4(3) ; EU AI 
Act, supra note 13, art. 53(1)(c) ; see also  infra text accompanying notes 339–341.

(noting that “it is currently unclear how opt -outs from [machine learning] training based on the machine -readable

 27 so long as they are “stored with an appropriate level of  security.”165 By contrast, Article 4  states that  
the relevant “[r]eproductions and extractions .  . . may be retained for as long as is necessary for the 
purposes of  text and data mining.”166 
Importantly, both Articles 3 and 4 are subject to a general safeguard incorporated by reference 
from the EU Directive on the Harmonisation of  Certain Aspects of  Copyright and Related Rights in 
the Information Society ,167 which  incorporates the last two steps of  the three -step test  mentioned  
above .168 Artic le 5(5) of  the Directive provides that copyright exceptions and limitations “shall only 
be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of  the work or 
other subject -matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of  the right holder.”169 
4. Singapore  
As part of  broad -ranging amendments that became  its 2021 Copyright Act, Singapore 
introduced Section 244, an exception permitting making and ret aining copies of  lawfully accessed 
works for purposes of  computational data analysis.170 Such analysis is defined broadly to include “using 
a computer program to identify, extract and analyse information or data from the work or recording” 
and “using the work or recording as an example of  a type of  information or data to improve the 
functioni ng of  a computer program in relation to that type of  information or data.”171 Section 243 
further provides as an illustration the use of  “images to train a computer program to recognise 
images.”172 With this illustration, it is beyond dispute that the new exception covers AI training.  
The Singapore exception for computational data analysis applies to both commercial and 
noncommercial use. However, it is limited by a “lawful access” requirement173 and a duty to avoid 
training on infringing copies, including those found in a “flagrantly infringing online location .”174 This 
exception does not allow for the circumvention of  TPMs , which is prohibited under a separate 
 
165 DSM Directive, supra note 152, art. 3(2).  
166 Id. art. 4(2).  
167 See id.  art. 7(2) (“Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29/EC shall apply to the exceptions and limitations provided for under 
this Title.”).  
168 See supra  text accompanying note s 75–76. 
169 InfoSoc Directive, supra note 162, art. 5(5).  
170 Copyright Act 2021  [Singapore Copyright Act] (2020 Rev Ed)  § 244(1) –(2)(d), (3) (Sing.).  
171 Id. § 243 ; see also MINISTRY OF L. & INTELL . PROP. OFF. OF SING., SINGAPORE COPYRIGHT REVIEW REPORT 32–34 
(2019).  Section 244 of the Singapore Copyright Act  also provides for the limited communication of such works to the 
public for the purposes of verification or to enable “collaborative research or study relating to the purpose” of the origina l 
computational data analysis. Singapore Copyright Act  § 244( 2)(c)(ii). The Act further  imposes an obligation to identify 
authors in such communication and confers other similar moral rights. Id. §§ 369 –407. 
172 Singapore Copyright Act § 243.  
173 Id. § 244(2)(d).  
174 Id. § 244(2)(e)(ii)(B). The Act defines a “flagrantly infringing online location” as “an online location that has been or is 
being used to flagrantly commit or facilitate rights infringements.” Id. § 99(1). It also provides seven factors for determining 
whether an online location is flagrantly infringing. Id. § 99(2).  


THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
 28 provision in the Singapore Copyright Act.175 Like the UK TDM exception and Article 3 of  the EU 
DSM Directive, the Singapore exception is immune from contractual override176 and is not subject to 
any obligation to respect opt -outs.  
Finally, although we discuss  Singapore alongside  Japan, the United Kingdom, and the 
European Union in relation to their express exceptions for TDM or computational data analysis , it is 
worth recalling that Singapore also has a fair use provision.177 Having both provisions is both rare and 
important. It is rare because jurisdictions that have adopted an open -ended regime tend to rely on fair 
use to address new technological challenges posed to the copyright system. The existence of  the two 
provision s, therefore, shows Singapore’s  determination to advance AI development regardless of  the 
interpretation of  the fair use provision. Having both provisions  is also important because if  Singapore 
ends up interpreting the fair use provision the same way as the United States in the context of  
nonexpressive use, Singapore will have an additional express exception to cover issues that may fall 
outside the scope o f  fair use.178 
C. Lack of Dedicated Exceptions Despite Active AI Development  
After covering jurisdictions with fair use provisions or close variants  and those with express 
copyright exceptions for TDM or computational data analysis , this section turns to countries that have 
been actively pursuing AI development but that have not yet updated their copyright laws to facilitate 
AI training. Due to its limited length, this section explores , in turn,  only China and the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE).  The discussion of  these countries raises interesting questions about the role of  law 
in AI development as well as the growing determination of  countries to compete in the global AI race 
regardless of  whether they have completed the needed copyright law re forms.  
1. China  
Like the European Union and the United States , China is a major technological power that ha s 
received considerable attention in the global AI debate, especially in relation to its technological rivalry 
 
175 See id.  § 425. Any work accessed through TPM circumvention would be unlawfully accessed and would therefore be 
excluded from Section 244’s permissions.  
176 See id.  § 187(c). Evasion of this provision through choice of law is also prohibited. Id. § 188.

29 with other major technological powers .179 In the past decade, China has made considerable progress180 
and began seeking  global AI leader ship.181 AI has featured prominently in the country’s strategic plans 
for economic, social, scientific, and technological developments.182 The State Council ’s Next -
Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan  outlines the target for China  to become the 
world’s major AI innovation center by 2030.183 China has also actively export ed its model of  
technology development and regulation ,184 which will have major implications for global AI 
development . According to the Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 , produced by the Institute for 
Human -Centered AI at Stanford University, China currently dominates the world in both AI patents 
and installations of  industrial robots.185 In a recent patent landscape report, WIPO also lists China -
based Tencent, Ping An, Baidu, and the Chinese Academy of  Sciences as the world’s organizational 
leaders in volume of  generative AI patents between 2014 and 2023.186 For comparison, IBM ranks

 30 only fifth in the same category.187 As this Article entered production, China -based DeepSeek and its 
emerging competition with other major AI developers garnered significant media attention.188 
On November 11, 2020, amid the COVID -19 pandemic, China adopted the Third 
Amendment to the Copyright Law.189 Entering into effect on June 1, 2021, this amendment provided 
a major overhaul of its copyright regime.190 Article 24  of the amended statute  enumerate s 
circumstances in which a copyrighted work may be used without authorization or remuneration.191 
Although  the old provision on copyright limitations and exceptions provided only a closed list192—
similar to provisions found in jurisdictions with express copyright exceptions for TDM or 
computational data analysis —the latest amendment transformed that list by adding Clause 13, which 
covers “[o]ther circumstances provided for by laws and administrative regulations.”193 This change d id 
not convert China to an open -ended regime like the U.S.  fair use regime , but it is likely to promote AI 
training and development once the appropriate regulations have been introduced . 
At the time of writing , China has not yet updated the Regulations for the Implementation of 
the Copyright Law , but it is anticipated to do so  in the near future .194 Should a new copyright exception 
for TDM or computational data analysis —similar to one found in Japan, the United Kingdom, the 
European Union, or Singapore195—be introduced through either the updated Implementing

 31 Regulations or a new set of AI-specific regulations , that exception could be read into Article 24(13) 
of the Copyright Law.  
In July 2023, China adopted the Interim  Measures for the Management of  Generative Artificial 
Intelligence Services,196 pioneering legislation that aimed to give China an early-mover advantage 
similar to  the EU AI Act.197 While the measures mention intellectual property rights ,198 the language 
is vague and open to interpretation. Specifically, Article 4 of  the Interim  Measures  states that “[t]he 
provision and use of  generative AI services shall .  . . [r]espect intellectual property rights and 
commercial  ethics [and]  protect business secrets.”199 Article 7 (3) further stipulates : “Where intellectual 
property rights are involved, the intellectual property rights that are lawfully enjoyed by others must 
not be infringed  [by the providers of  generative AI services ].”200 How these provisions are  to be 
interpreted will, of  course, depend on the Chinese courts’ determination of  the legality of  the use of  
copyrighted works to train AI models . Should such use be deemed legal, Articles 4 and 7 will not 
provide additional protection to copyright holders.  
The development of  AI technology in China and the role copyright law plays in such 
development remain to be seen. It will be intriguing to observe how the country balances the usual 
tension s between exerting control over technology companies in a state -driven economy and 
providing them with the freedom to grow into the national champions that the country will need to 
stay ahead in global  AI competition .201 Moreover, as the European Union, the United States, and other 
countries continue to adopt nationalist policies to compete with China,202 what policies these 
jurisdictions  will adopt and how China will respond will create an additional layer of  uncertainty.

32 2. United Arab Emirates
The UAE provides another interesting case study  due to  its substantial invest ment in AI
technology203 and its mixed legal system featur ing both civil law and Shari’a.204 Released in 2017, its 
national AI strategy makes clear its “vision to become one of  the leading nations in AI by 2031.”205 
In May 2023 , researchers at the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi announced the 
launch of  the open -source Falcon series of  LLMs.206 Although t he Falcon series are compar able to 
models released by OpenAI and Meta ,207 the UAE Law on Copyright and Neighboring Rights does 
not contain a fair use provision or an express exception for TDM or computational data analysis.208 
Instead, Article 22(1) allows for the “[r]eproduc[tion of] one single copy of  the Work for purely 
personal use  [and]  for non -profit and non -professional purposes,” with the exception for works of  
fine or applied arts, architectural works, and computer programs, applications, and databases.209 Like 
Japan’s copyright exception for a non -enjoyment purpose ,210 the entire Article 22  of  the UAE Law on 
Copyright and Neighboring Rights , which includes other exceptions, is subject to the last two steps 
of  the three -step test  mentioned above .211 
The open -source nature of  the Falcon models and their association with a state university may 
qualify them as “non -profit and non -professional” within the meaning of  Article 22(1). However, it 
is unclear whether this sub -provision  fully covers the AI training involved in developing these models.

considering that its close neighbor, Saudi Arabia, has similar ambitions in AI development .213 
D. Affordances  for Machine Learning  and AI Training  
The three previous sections have shown that the three types of  jurisdictions surveyed in this 
Part have embrace d, to varying degrees , TDM, computational data analysis, and other  nonexpressive 
uses of  copyrighted works. Their differing national preferences, in turn, translate into different 
legislation. This section  provides a systematic analysis of  some of  the copyright exceptions discussed 
above  to illustrate the impact of  system  design and implementation on the degree of  affordance for 
machine learning  and AI training . The analysis also identifies the implications of  these laws for both 
rightsholders and AI developers.   
Table 1 indicates the affordances individual jurisdictions provide for AI training by addressing 
four key questions: (1) whether the jurisdiction allows for noncommercial TDM; (2) whether it also 
allows for commercial TDM; (3) whether the relevant exceptio n applies to all relevant copyright rights 
or only the reproduction right; and finally, (4) whether the TDM exception extend s to specific 
applications , including machine learning and generative AI. Table 2 provides additional details on each 
jurisdiction, framed in terms of  the ramifications  of  their copyright exceptions for rightsholders and 
AI developers. The tables omit China and the UAE due to difficulties in ascertaining how the relevant 
copyright exceptions apply in the AI context .

218 In this row, we focus on whether the relevant copyright provision , statute,  or portion there of has incorporated the last 
step of the three -step test. However, it is worth bearing in mind that international agreements containing this test may be 
directly applicable in self -executing jurisdictions. See Peter K. Yu, Anticircumvention and Anti -Anticircumvention , 84 DENV. U.
L.REV. 13, 34 n.99 (2006) (“A self -executing treaty is one that can be enforced in courts without prior implementing
legislation. In jurisdictions where [treaties] are self -executing, courts will directly apply the treaties as if they are domestic
laws.”). Court s may also take international commitments into account when interpreting copyright provisions. See, e.g. ,
Murray v. The Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804) (“An act of Congress ought never to be
construed to violate the law of nations, if any other possible construction remains.”).
219 Even though the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 has not incorporated the last step of the three -step test in
relation to copyright limitations and exceptions, Section 29A was added to the section containing different fair dealing
provisions. See Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, c. 48 , § 29A  (UK) . Eleonora Rosati  argues  that the evaluation of
the fairness of the act of dealing with a copyrighted work is likely to have address ed issues raised by the last step of the
three -step test. See Eleonora Rosati, No Step -Free Copyright Exceptions: The Role of the Three -Step in Defining Permitted Uses of
Protected Content (Including TDM for AI -Training Purposes) , 46 EUR. INTELL . PROP. REV. 262, 271 (2024) (“[L]ike most UK
defences, s.29A CDPA is framed within fair dealing. Hence, a court tasked with determining whether the provision is
applicable in the circumstances at hand will need to determine if the relevant conditions are satisfied, i ncluding having
regard to the fairness of the dealing at hand.”).
220 The Singapore Copyright Act has not incorporated the last step of the three -step test. Nevertheless, we believe that the
courts’ interpretation of the “lawful access ” requirement , the narrow focus on computational data analysis, the duty to
avoid training on infringing copies, and other constraints in Section 244 are likely to ensure that the exception is used in a
manner that will not unreasonably prejudice the right sholder’s legitimate interests. Accord  Rosati, supra note 219, at 271
(holding a similar view).
221 We treat the fair use inquiry into “the purpose and character of the use” and “the effect of the use upon the potential
market for or value of the copyrighted work” as equivalent to the condition that the use may not “unreasonably prejudice
the legitimate interests of the right holder ,” the last step of the three -step-test. 17 U.S.C. § 107 ; see also supra text

Combining these two tables gives us an overview of  how the jurisdiction s surveyed in this 
Article have addressed the copyright issues inherent in TDM, machine learning , and AI training. The 
jurisdictions surveyed have made different choices in design and implementation, especially in relation 
to issue s such as lawful access requirements and how to address contractual and technological 
restrictions imposed by rightsholders. In jurisdictions where the legality of  training AI models on 
copyrighted works without express authorizat ion depends on the application of  a n open -ended legal 
standard such as fair use , there is still some uncertainty over how courts will rule on these questions . 
Nevertheless, we see three areas of  broad agreement. First, each jurisdiction recognizes that in some 
circumstances TDM is socially valuable and does not inherently prejudice the copyright holders’ 
legitimate interests. Second, the copying inherent in TDM  research should be allowed without express 
authorization  in most  circumstances. Third, any right to engage in TDM should not be a blank check.  
In virtually all  jurisdictions, the scope of  the relevant limitation or exception is subject to some 
kind of  assessment of  whether the un licensed  use would prejudice the copyright holder’s legitimate 
 
224 No case holds that respecting opt -outs such as robot.txt exclusions is essential for a determination of fair use. However, 
we believe that , in some circumstances , respect for such opt -outs will be considered under the fair use doctrine. See Sag, 
Copy-Reliant Technology , supra note 12, at 1675.  
225 Section 29A(1)(b)  of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 allows for the “making of a copy of a work” for 
“computational analysis” in certain limited circumstances, but only if “the copy is accompanied by a sufficient 
acknowledgement (unless this would be impossible for reasons of practicality or otherwise).” Copyright, Designs and 
Patents Act 1988, c. 48 , § 29A(1)(b)  (UK) . 
226 See DSM Directive, supra note 152, art. 3( 2) (calls for “stor[age] with a n appropriate level of security ”); id. art. 3( 3) 
(“Rightholders shall be allowed to apply measures to ensure the security and integrity of the networks and databases where 
the works or other subject matter are hosted .”). 
227 In HathiTrust  and Google Books , the court considered the security measures adopted by the defendants in relation to the 
plaintiff’s argument that it would suffer market harm due to the dissemination of the scanned library books. Authors Guild 
v. HathiTrust, 755 F.3d 87, 100–01 (2d Cir. 2014) ; Authors Guild v. Google, Inc.  (Google Books ), 804 F. 3d 202 , 227 –28. 
Failure to take reasonable precautions to prevent works copied for a valid fair use purpose from being used for another 
purpose could undermine a fair use defense in the United States.

37 interests. Although s uch assessment is not obvious from the copyright exceptions in the United 
Kingdom and Singapore , commentators take the view that courts will take into account the impact of  
the un licensed  use on the copyright holder’s legitimate interests.228 
In Singapore , for instance , the Copyright Act protects  the rightsholders’ interests by 
introducing a “lawful access” requirement and a duty to avoid training on infringing copies found in 
sites of  flagrant copyright infringement.229 More importantly, although Section 244 applies quite 
broadly to computational data analysis, nothing in th at exception appears to carry forward to 
downstream uses.230 Thus , if  a company train s a music generation model in Singapore and that model 
tends to produce infringing derivative versions of  the songs in its training data, those outputs would  
still be infringing.  
Finally, although we have not observed a major  disconnect between law on the books and law 
in action , readers should stay alert for this possibility .231 Assessing whether such a gap exists in the area 
of  AI training is not always easy. To begin with, most of  these exceptions have been adopted for only 
about a decade or less. It will therefore take some time before we have enough case law or other 
information to assess their application . A case in point is Section 29A of  the UK Copyright, Designs 
and Patents Act 1988, which has never been used  in the past decade .232 Even if  the  exceptions  had 
existed longer , the low volume of  copyright litigation in some  of  these jurisdictions might  not allow 
the relevant  jurisdictions  to generate sufficient cases to illustrate the laws’ application. Indeed, a key 
criticism of  the proposals  to transplant the U.S. fair use provision has been  the lack of  precedents in 
the recipient jurisdictions to facilitate post -transplant interpretation.233 
III.FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO CONVERGENCE
In view of  the emerging international equilibrium on copyright and AI training documented
above , this Part explores three  factors that have contributed to such emergence : (1) the centrality of

 38 the idea -expression distinction  in copyright law ; (2) global competition in AI; and (3) the race to the 
middle  among countries undertaking copyright law reforms . 
A. Centrality of the Idea-Expression Distinction  
Regardless of  the divisions between common law and civil law traditions (and, by extension, 
the copyright and droit d’auteur  systems )—or the differences in economic conditions , technological 
capabilities , political systems, and cultural backgrounds —the idea-expression di stinction is a key basic 
principle of copyright law . Providing the internal logic  of  a copyright system and s erving as the 
Grundnorm234 across a large number of  jurisdictions, this distinction provides a powerful gravitational 
force pull ing together different copyright exceptions in the area of  AI training.  
In the United States, Section 102(a) of  the 1976 Copyright Act stipulates that “[c]opyright 
protection subsists .  . . in original works of  authorship fixed in any tangible medium of  expression.”235 
Section 102(b) states further that copyright protection does not “extend to any idea, procedure, 
process, system, method of  operation, concept, principle, or discovery.”236 As the U nited States 
Supreme Court remind s us, the uncopyrightable nature of  facts and ideas is “the most fundamental 
axiom of  copyright law,”237 and the idea -expression distinction strikes “a definitional balance” between 
copyright law and the First Amendment.238 
In the United Kingdom , the dichotomy is less talismanic ,239 yet it can still be easily found in 
case law and academic commentary. For example , in Hollinrake v. Trustwell , an 1894  copyright case 
before the Court of  Appeal of  England and Wales, Lord Justice Lindley declared: “Copyright . . . does 
 
234 As Claude Masouyé observed in WIPO’s official guide to the Berne Convention, an international instrument now 
abided by more than 180 countries: “A fundamental point is that ideas, as such, are not protected by copyright.  . . . [O]nce 
that idea has been el aborated and expressed, copyright protection exists for the words, notes, drawings, etc., in which it is 
clothed. In other words, it is the form of expression which is capable of protection and not the idea itself.” CLAUDE 
MASOUYÉ , GUIDE TO THE BERNE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF LITERARY ARTISTIC WORKS (PARIS ACT, 
1971)  12 (1978); see also HANS KELSEN , PURE THEORY OF LAW 8–9 (Max Knight trans., 2d ed., Univ. of Cal . Press 1967) 
(introducing the concept of “Grundnorm”).  
235 17 U.S.C. § 102(a).  
236 Id. § 102(b). The distinction is longstanding. See e.g. , Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 104 (1880) (distinguishing between 
the protectable expression of a bookkeeping system and the unprotectable system itself).  
237 Feist Publ ’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 353 (1991).

 39 not extend to ideas, or schemes, or systems, or methods; it is confined to their expression; and if  their 
expression is not copied, the copyright is not infringed.”240 
Courts in civil law jurisdictions may not invoke the idea -expression distinction by name as 
frequently as in the United States  and other common law jurisdictions , but they arrive at the same 
conclusion. Instead of  using case law precedents and engaging in a balancing exercise to separate the 
expression from the idea, civil law judges and commentators focus on the nature of  the copyright 
interest and the object of  copyright law. For instance , Japan ’s copyright exception for TDM and related 
uses focuses on wh ether the un licensed  use of  a copyrighted work has affected the enjoyment of  “the 
thoughts or sentiments expressed in” that work.241 Covering both common law and civil law 
jurisdictions, Article 1.2 of  the EU Directive on the Legal Protection of  Computer Programs  also 
declares: “Protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of  a 
computer program. Ideas and principles which underlie any element of  a computer program, including 
those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected  by copyright under this Directive.”242 
At the global level , Article 9 .2 of  the Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of  Intellectual 
Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement ) of  the World Trade Organization (WTO)  states: “Copyright 
protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of  operation or 
mathematical concepts as such.”243 Originating from Japan’s proposal for the provision on computer 
programs, th e TRIPS  provision “for the first time in an international agreement provides for a list of  
uncopyrightable subject matter.”244 At the time of  writing, more than 160 countries are WTO 
members and abide by the TRIPS Agreement,245 making the idea -expression distinction virtually

40 universal around the world.246 Subsequent instruments, such as the WIPO Copyright Treaty, have 
similar formulations.247  
The centrality and universality of  the idea -expression distinction goes a  long way to explaining 
the convergence demonstrated in Part I I with respect to AI training. Consistent with the idea -
expression distinction, c opyright law should generally allow for substantial latitude for actions that 
technically amount to copying but fail to communicate an author’s original expression to a new 
audience .248 Such latitude makes especially appropriate an exception for AI training —whether in the 
form of  fair use, a n express  exception  for TDM or computational data analysis , or something else . 
This approach is well supported by academic commentators. As o ne of  us has advocated, courts 
should recognize a principle of  nonexpressive use to resolve questions relating to copy -reliant 
technologies .249 Some commentators have gone even further. In a forthcoming article, Oren Bracha 
argue s that nonexpressive uses such as AI training are not cognizable as acts of  copying in the first 
place , and thus there is no need to engage with questions relating to copyright limitations and 
exceptions.250 
Notwithstanding the gravitational pull of the idea -expression distinction, some commentators 
have question ed whether the unlicensed  use of  copyright ed works to train AI models fall s within the 
idea side of  the idea -expression distinction and whether existing case law provides sufficient precedent 
to extend prior rulings to generative AI.251 The answer s to these question s are further complicated by 
246 See TRIPS RESOURCE BOOK, supra note 244, at 139 (“[T]he rule that copyright protection extends only to expressions 
and not to the underlying ideas is generally recognized in all countries.”); see also Peter K. Yu, Clusters and Links in Asian 
Intellectual Property Law and Policy , in ROUTLEDGE HANDBOOK OF ASIAN LAW 147, 150 –51 (Christoph Antons ed., 2017) 
(crediting the WTO and its TRIPS Agreement for being “[t]he primary driver of convergence of intellectual property laws 
in Asia”).

copyright holders.252 Indeed, the relationship between the input s and output s in AI models has been 
the key focus of  ongoing litigation, which Section  IV.A.1 will discuss further .253 
B. Global  Competition  in AI 
In the past few years, policymakers, commentators, and the mainstream media have p aid 
growing attention to the technology race between China, the European Union, and the United States. 
For example , in Digital Empires , Anu Bradford explores the ongoing rivalries between these major 
geopolitical  powers over their varying models of  technology regulation and their efforts to export 
those models.254 Susan Aaronson outlines the negative implications of  policies  promoting AI 
nationalis m, such as  data protection and localization laws, export controls on semiconductor chips, 
and subsidization of  cloud infrastructure and high -speed computing .255 Lee Kai -Fu, the former 
president of  Google China, documents China’s substantial engagement in the AI space and its active 
development of  AI -driven products and services.256 
At the time of  writing, U.S. companies dominat e the AI race. Such  dominance ha s attracted 
considerable attention from European and U.S. competition authorities.257 As the European

 42 Parliament  observes , U.S. companies account ed for about half  of  the total AI investments  in 2023 .258 
The Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024  also states : “The United States leads China, the EU, and the 
U.K. as the leading source of  top AI models. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S. -
based institutions, far outpacing the European Union’s 21 and China’s 15.”259 Although many factors 
shape the environment for AI develop ment ,260 it is not difficult for countries around  the world to 
notice that the United State has a highly  hospita ble copyright system for machine learning and AI 
training.  
Since the arrival of  generative AI, countries with varying geopolitical strengths and global 
competitiveness have be come  eager to join the AI race.261 Their motivation is partly the fear of  falling 
behind and becoming dependent  on foreign technology and partly the desire to reap the economic, 
scientific, and strategic benefits  of  domestic control of  AI .262 In these circumstances, it is no surpris e 
to find countries eager to emulate the U.S. approach to promote AI training  and development . To a 
large extent, the affordances  of the U.S. fair use regime have place d considerable  pressure  on these 
countries . Similar sentiments have been expressed in consultation documents released abroad  
concerning the role of  the copyright system in developing the Internet and other digital 
technologies.263 
As if  the pressure to stay in the AI race were not acute enough, one cannot lose sight of  the 
fact that AI models, once trained, are portable and can therefore be deployed in or accessed from 
other parts of  the world. The territorial  nature  of copyright  law264 and the realities  of AI training  
mean  that an AI developer can train its model  in the United States, taking advantage of  its fair use

43 regime, before making that model available globally .265 Even better, that developer may be able to do 
so without  significant risks of copyright  liability.  Properly  trained,  an AI model  is separate  from  the 
training data , and is therefore not a copy or derivative  work  of that data.266 So long as that model  
consists  purely  of uncopyrightable  abstractions,  patterns,  relationships , and information  gleaned  from  
the training  data and does not embody  the original  expression  residing in that data, the model  does 
not infringe  copyright —whether in the United States or other jurisdiction s. 
Moreover , AI developers in jurisdictions  with more restrictive copyright laws can use models  
trained  in the United States (or other jurisdictions with more permissive laws) by either  setting  up a 
data pipeline  with leading U.S. AI developers  or hosting their models  in the U nited States.267 To 
enhance global competitiveness, these companies may eventually lobby their home governments to 
undertake copyright reform  to provide greater support for AI training . To reduce regulatory arbitrage  
and to ensure that AI developments stay within the national border s, policymakers in jurisdictions 
with more restrictive copyright laws  may also voluntarily advocate for similar reform.268 
Another factor that may affect global AI competition  is the introduction of  laws with 
extraterritorial effects , whether direct o r indirect . A case in point is the EU AI Act,269 which Section  
IV.B will discuss further.270 Recital 21 states explicitly that “the rules established by this Regulation
should apply to providers of  AI systems in a non -discriminatory manner, irrespective of  whether they
are established within the Union or in a third country.”271 Recital 106 states further  that “[a]ny provider
placing a general -purpose AI model on the Union market should comply with this [regulation] ,
regardless of  the jurisdiction in which the copyright -relevant acts underpinning the training of  those
general -purpose AI models take place.”272 There are significant problems with such extraterritorial
regulation , however . First, it remains to be seen how well the AI Act  will be enforced , both internally
and ext ernally .273 Second, and more important ly, it is unclear whether the training of  AI models in a n
265 See João Pedro Quintais, Generative AI, Copyright and the AI , 56 COMPUT . L. & SEC. REV. (forthcoming 2025)  (discussing

chain).  
268 However, t he policy space for such reform is limited, due to the anchoring effect of international copyright norms 
protecting the right sholders’ interests in controlling the communication of their original expressions and the possible 
stickiness of key human resources in AI development. Global competition will therefore lead to further convergence , 
rather than a race to the bottom in which countries lower their copyright standards to facilitate AI training .

44 AI-friendly  jurisdiction would necessarily constitute an infringing act under copyright law from a 
choice -of-law standpoint.274 
C. Race to the Middle
Commentators  tend to analyze regulatory arbitrage in terms of  a race to the top or the
bottom ,275 as opposed to what commentators have referred to as a “race to the middle.”276 In the 
intellectual property context , such analysis is more complicated . To begin with , it is difficult to 
determine which race is to the top and which to the bottom. As Peter Jaszi reminds us , “one might 
say that one nation’s ‘piracy []’ is another man’s ‘technology transfer.’”277 The benefits of  a specific 
copyright provision are often in the eye s of  the beholder.278 A very broad copyright exception for AI 
training marks a race to the top for generative AI developers , but a race to the bottom for traditional 
copyright -focused industries such as media  and publishing . 
More importantly , countries do not always engage in a race to either  extreme . Many have 
chosen to compromise or take the middle path. As one of  us has shown earlier in an article examining 
the global transplant ation of  the U.S. fair use provision, many jurisdictions  have struck compromises 
by adopting hybrid models.279 Those models allow these jurisdictions  to retain part of  the status quo 
while adding new fair use elements that would help the copyright system evolve without undergoing  
a dramatic  paradigm shift.280  
In recent years, commentators have called for greater scholarly attention to this race to the 
middle. For instance , William Magnuson discusses how federalis m practiced in the United States  has

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
 45 enticed states to engage in such a race in the business and corporate governance context s.281 As he 
explains, racing to the middle offers four primary benefits:  
First, states benefit from a number of  informational effects when they adopt legal 
regimes that are well established and widely prevalent. Second, corporations and firms 
have strong interests in seeking out, and locating themselves in, jurisdictions that h ave 
familiar legal structures. Third, adopting a widely prevalent legal structure provides a 
set of  interoperability benefits for both corporations and firms. And fourth, the risk 
of  federal intervention is lower when states have legal structures well with in the norms 
of  other state behavior.282 
More specifically i n the intellectual property context , several reasons explain why countries 
chose to retain part of  their pre existing copyright system  despite their eager ness to transplant the U.S. 
fair use provision. For example , policymakers and legislators may “push for innovation in the legal 
system while at the same time demanding the retention of  what they consider as the strengths of  
current law or what they perceive as an important local tradition.”283 In doing so, they seek to “achieve 
the best of  both worlds.”284 These policymakers and legislators may also actively customize the 
transplanted regime to ensure the appropriateness and effectiveness  of  the transplanted laws .285 Finally, 
interest group politics and legislative  inertia may force legislators to strike compromise s by adopting 
hybrid models.286 
Because a copyright exception for TDM , computational data analysis,  or AI training is a subset 
of  a general copyright exception , akin to an open -ended fair use provision, we expect similar dy namics 
to play out when  countries explore whether to introduce a new exception to facilitate  AI training. For 
instance , policymakers and legislators may seek to “achieve the best of  both worlds” by introducing a 
new exception for TDM , computational data analysis,  or AI training without disturbing other 
provisions in the existing copyright system .287 They may also feel compelled to customize the 
transplanted exception based on local conditions and legal tradition. In addition, interest group 
politics , legislative inertia, and the legitimate interests of countervailing constituencies  may induce 
them to strike compromises by taking the middle path.

 46 D. Summary  
The three contributing factors identified in this Part explain why copyright laws in the different 
jurisdictions surveyed in Part II are converging in the area of  AI training. Although these jurisdictions 
have yet to achieve consensus, similar contributing factors could be at work in other jurisdictions, 
especially considering that the European Union and the United States have already adopted similar 
exceptions  to promote AI training and development . Thus, we predict further global convergence  in 
this area beyond the jurisdictions surveyed in this Article . 
IV. UNCERTAINTIES  THAT MAY UPSET THE EQUILIBRIUM  
The previous Part identified factors that have contributed to the emerg ing international 
equilibrium on copyright and AI training . This Part turns to potential uncertainties  that might upset 
this equilibrium  in the future . This Part first discusses ongoing copyright litigation, partnerships and 
licensing deals, and legislative and regulatory efforts  in the United States. It then explores 
developments in the European Union , with a focus on the EU AI Act . 
A. United States  
1. Ongoing Litigation  
As discussed  above , U.S. c ourts have held that the fair use doctrine justified nonexpressive 
uses by copy -reliant technologies such as reverse engineering, plagiarism detection, book and image 
search, and digital humanities research across millions of  library books.288 The logical extension of  
these nonexpressive use cases is that the copying involved in training AI models will, in most ordinary 
circumstances, amount to fair use.289 Admittedly , our view is not shared by the plaintiffs in over two  
dozen individual and class -action lawsuits now being adjudicated or pending in U .S. district courts .290 
The plaintiffs include famous and unknown authors  and artists , politicians, record labels, image rights 
aggregators, and news outlets.  Collectively , these cases —which we will refer to as “generative AI cases”  
below —demand an end to AI training without express authorization, billions of  dollars in damages, 
and the destruction of  AI models.291 
 
288 See supra notes 15–19. 
289 See Sag, Copyright Safety , supra note 44, at 326 –37 (discussing the limited circumstances in which the copying involved in 
training AI models may create problems for fair use).

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
47 In the generative AI cases filed t hus far, courts have already dismissed many of  the more 
speculative liability theories asserted .292 Other dismissal s are likely to follow.293 However, s ome 
generative AI cases  may succeed , while  others may settle . Because a  systematic review of  the merits 
of  each lawsuit is beyond the scope of  this Article , this section discusses only a few notable  
complaints . 
The generative AI plaintiffs’ most promising paths are fact specific . For example , the 
consolidated cases in Tremblay v. OpenAI, Inc.294 present a plausible argument under the fourth fair use 
factor that commercial AI developers undermine the basic incentive structure of copyright by training 
on sites of known infringement and thus bypass ing the market for access without a compelling 
justification.295 The Tremblay plaintiffs  alleged that OpenAI and other developers had obtained access 
to over 100,000 books and other works through  shadow libraries , such as Library Genesis, Z -Library, 
Sci-Hub, and Bibliotik .296 This relatively novel argument is bolstered by its resonance with copyright 
laws in other jurisdictions. In the European Union , for instance , “lawful access” to the relevant 
copyrighted works is an essential condition under the TDM  exceptions in the DSM Directive.297 
Similar ly, the exception for computational data analysis in Singapore is subject to both a “lawful 
access ” requirement and a duty to avoid training on infringing copies  found in sites of  flagrant 
copyright infringement .298 
Even though the generative AI plaintiffs almost invariably argue that any unlicensed  
reproduction of  copyrighted works is infring ing regardless of  the circumstances, recent  complaints 
have devote d substantial attention to demonstrating extensive memorization. Rather than fighting 
against the weight of  authority in the nonexpressive use cases  mentioned above , some plaintiffs may 
be able to demonstrate that the extent of  memorization in particular cases is so significant that the AI 
training  in question do es not qualify as a nonexpressive use. For example , the complaints in New York 
292 See Sarah Andersen v. Stability AI Ltd. No. 23 -CV-00201 -WHO, 2024 WL 3823234, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2024)

Copyright Act and various state -law claims).  
293 For example, the plaintiffs in Raw Story Media, Inc. v. OpenAI, Inc.  and The Intercept Media Inc. v. OpenAI, Inc.  relied

 48 Times Co. v. Microsoft  Corp.299 and Concord Music Group, Inc. v. Anthropic PBC300 are accompanied by 
impressive examples of  memorization demonstrated through the reproduction of  specific works. If  
these plaintiffs can show  that the AI models at issue routinely and indiscriminately reproduce works 
in the training data and that such reproductions are more than theoretically accessible, they will have 
seriously undermine d the defendants’  fair use defenses. With the factual record at such an early stage, 
the outcomes of  these cases are hard to predict . Yet even if  some cases  succe ed, we are fairly confident 
that the generally AI -friendly  orientation of  the U.S. fair use regime  will continue —due partly to 
nonexpressive use precedents set by cases such as HathiTrust  and Google Books  and partly to reluctance 
of  American judges to throttle this American -led technology or send its development overseas . 
2. Partnerships and Licensing Deals  
Although commentators have paid considerable attention to litigation in the wake of  the 
launch of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, the past two years have seen AI developers , such 
as OpenAI and Google,  actively developing partnerships and licensing deals  with publishing houses  
and media conglomerates .301 
Consider OpenAI, for instance . In December 2023, this dominant generative AI developer  
announced its partnership with Axel Springer .302 In addition to authorizing training on copyrighted  
content, the partnership allows OpenAI to provide  “summaries of  selected global news content from 
Axel Springer’s media brands ,” such as Politico  and Business Insider .303 In exchange , OpenAI agrees to 
include in “ChatGPT’s answers to user queries . . . attribution and links to the full articles for 
transparency and further information.”304 A few months later, OpenAI announced another 
partnership “with international news organizations Le Monde and Prisa Media to bring French and 
Spanish news content to ChatGPT.”305 In May 2024 , OpenAI struck a deal with News Corp. that

49 “could be worth more than $250 million over five years.”306 Most recently , the magazine empire of  
Condé Nast announced a similar deal with OpenAI , which allow s for the use of  content from  Vogue , 
The New Yorker , Vanity Fair , and Wired , among others .307 
While these alliances will help prevent lawsuits from licensing partners , it is possible that they 
will weaken the position of  AI developers  in ongoing and future fair use litigation.308 As noted above, 
courts have generally rejected circular and hypothetical claims of  injury under the fourth fair use  factor  
and have focused on lost licensing revenue “only when the use serves as a substitute for the original.”309 
However , in other cases, courts have considered actual  and potential injury to licensing markets .310 In 
theory, e mpirical evidence of  the existence of  a viable market for AI training data could  tip the balance 
of  the fourth factor against the defendants in generative AI  cases. In reality , however, the partnerships 
and licensing arrangements between AI developers and media conglomerates that we are aware of  
have yet to prove the viability of  an opt -in model.  
To begin with, the partnerships cover terms going beyond AI training, such as the provision 
of  summaries of  news content and the inclusion of  attribution and hyperlinks.311 Given the 
confidential terms of  the relevant agreements, it is difficult, if  not impossible, to determine which 
portion of  the partnerships , if  any, should be considered as the fee for licensing copyrighted content 
for AI training . More importantly , even though  the reported  licens ing deals are worth hundreds of  
millions of  dollars, the content they make available is a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of  
training data required for the current generation of  LLMs. For example , Meta’s Llama 3 was trained

not suffice to make the copy an effectively competing substitute that would tilt the weighty fourth factor in favor of the

 50 on over 15 trillion tokens collected from publicly available sources.312 Assuming that t he New York 
Times  print edition is roughly fifty pages per day , each page has 4000 words, and there are 1.3 tokens 
per word, the newspaper would generate roughly 1.82 million tokens per week . At that rate , it would 
take about 158,500 years to generate 15 trillion tokens.313 Even if  small models could be trained 
exclusively on public domain and licensed data, the notion of  rights clearance for training the current 
generation of  leading -edge LLMs is a fantasy.  
What the deals with media conglomerates  do show is that some generative AI developers will 
pay for easy access to significant caches of  high -quality training data that would otherwise be 
inaccessible due to paywalls and machine -readable exclusion headers. A developer that chose to ignore 
these safeguards  would be taking risk s under U .S. copyright  law314 and could fall outside the protection 
of  the E U DSM Directive.315 The content deals  discussed above are not just about access and training: 
they appear to  allow AI developers to cross the line from nonexpressive to expressive use. This may 
be particularly advantageous in the context of  AI -enabled search, a use case that combines language 
models with traditional Internet search316 and often results in paraphrased answers that may, from a 
copyright law stand point, be uncomfortably close to the original text.317 
Nevertheless, we can see that in the court of  public opinion , the tens or hundreds of  millions 
of  dollars that AI developers —some valued at billions or trillions of  dollars —are paying for content 
strengthens the argument that copyright holders are entitled to expect licenses for AI training. 
Accordingly, we view the above arrangements as a potential double -edged sword : they turn enemies 
into allies and provide a benchmark for future licensing negotiations to settle additional lawsuits , yet 
they may nega tively impact the AI developers ’ litigation position and general public sentiment.   
3. Legislative and Regulatory Efforts  
During the Biden Administration , the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee has held  ten public 
hearings on AI -related issues, covering intellectual property, human rights, regulatory issues , 
governance and oversight , journalism, criminal investigations and prosecutions, and deepfakes during 
 
312 Introducing Meta Llama 3 , supra note 36.

York Times has a large back -catalogue of content and that not all AI models require trillions of tokens of text to train.

 51 political elections .318 Thus far, Congress has yet to adopt any legislation addressing  copyright law and 
AI training  specifically . Nevertheless, it is considering bills that will affect AI development , especially 
in relation to problems created by deep fakes.319 Many states have also adopted or considered  new 
legislation to regulate digital replicas .320 All of  this new and emerging legislation may have spillover 
effects in the copyright area.  
The ongoing legislative efforts have recently earned the support of  the U.S. Copyright Office. 
As the Office declares  in the first part of  its AI study, which focuses on digital replicas : 
We recommend that Congress establish a federal right that protects all individuals 
during their lifetimes from the knowing distribution of  unauthorized digital replicas. 
The right should be licensable, subject to guardrails, but not assignable, with effect ive 
remedies including monetary damages and injunctive relief. Traditional rules of  
secondary liability should apply, but with an appropriately conditioned safe harbor for 
[online service providers] . The law should contain explicit First Amendment 
accommod ations. Finally, in recognition of  well -developed state rights of  publicity, we 
recommend against full preemption of  state laws.321 
Apart from new legislation, the Biden Administration has issued the Executive Order on the 
Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of  Artificial Intelligence ,322 which has since been 
revoked and replaced by a new Executive Order.323 Regulatory bodies such as the Federal Trade 
Commission  (FTC)  may also take action to address the varied challenges posed by AI developers and 
their technology .324 Although the FTC rarely interacts with copyright law —except to address the anti-
competitive effects posed by companies with substantial copyright interests325—the agency, in winter 
2023 , filed a somewhat controversial submission with the U.S. Copyright Office in response to the 
latter’s request for comments on AI and copyright.326 As the Commission declare d:

expression without the creator’s consent or selling output generated from such an AI 
tool, including by mimicking the creator’s writing style, vocal or instrumental 
perfo rmance, or likeness —may . . . constitute an unfair method of  competition or an

consumers, exploits a creator’s reputation or diminishes the value of  her existing or

consumers.327 
This comment has been heavily criticized by practitioners and academic commentators alike.328 
Although f urther discussion of  the FTC’s position and potential regulatory action s is outside the scope 
of  this Article , and we have offered our critiques separately elsewhere,329 it is worth noting that 
regulatory efforts  outside the intellectual property arena could deeply affect future AI development, 
including in the copyright area general ly and in relation to AI training  more specifically . With the 
arrival of  the new administration, some of  the positions taken by the government agencies under the 
Biden Administration have also change d.

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
 53 The legislative effort concerning the AI Act was launched in April 2 022 to address potential 
risks arising with advance s in AI technology.332 When this effort began , generative AI had yet to enter 
the regulatory picture. Nor was intellectual property protection the drafters’  key focus.333 Instead, the 
regulation governs  AI technology based on individual and societal risks.334 Half-way through the 
deliberation, intellectual property issues began to grab greater policy attention, due in no small part to  
ChatGPT’s  effect on public consciousness of  generative AI . In the end, the AI Act include d two key 
provisions  that will have major impacts on both copyright holders and AI developers:  Article 53 and 
Recital 106 .335 These provisions, however, “do[] not apply to AI systems or AI models, including their 
output, specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of  scientific research and 
development.”336 
Article 53 raises two separate issues : transparency  and remuneration . Article 53(1)(d) requires 
AI developers to “draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary about the 
content used for training of  the general -purpose AI model, according to a template provided by the 
AI Office.”337 While greater disclosure of  training materials can be beneficial,338 heavy disclosure 
obligations and cumbersome requirements may stifle future AI development. It remains to be seen 
how Article 53  applies in individual EU member states —in particular, whether its application can 
strike a good balance  between copyright protection and AI development . 
The second issue concerns remuneration. Article 53( 1)(c) requires “[p]roviders of  general -
purpose AI” to “put in place a policy to comply with Union law on copyright and related rights, and 
in particular to identify and comply with, including through state -of-the-art technologies, a reservation 
of  rights express ed pursuant to Article 4(3) of ” the DSM Directive.339 The referenced provision states 
that the TDM exception “shall apply on condition that the use of  [copyrighted] works and other 
subject matter .  . . has not been expressly reserved by their right sholders in an appropriate manner.”340 
 
332 See Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligen ce 
(Artificial Intelligence Act) and Amending Certain Union Legislative Acts , COM(2021) 206 final (Apr. 21, 2021). For overviews of 
the copyright provisions in the EU AI Act, see generally Peukert, supra note 273; Quintais, supra note 265. 
333 See Peukert, supra note 273, at 497, 499 (“Copyright was not considered a major problem requiring regulatory 
intervention and was not even mentioned in the proposal.  . . . [It] was a last -minute addition to an act with a very different 
subject matter and purpose.”); Quintais,  supra note 265 (noting that “[t]he AI Act is conceptually akin to a public law 
instrument designed through a product safety prism”).

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
 54 Taken together, the se two provisions enable copyright holders to opt out of  AI training  and demand 
compensation for the use of  their works.341 
Finally, as noted above , Recital 106 will have extraterritorial  effects , similar to other EU 
legislation  such as the  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) .342 While there is no denying the 
“Brussels effect” generated by the GDPR,343 it is unclear  whether  non-EU countries will feel the same 
pressure to adopt legislation consistent  with the EU AI Act , especially consider ing that AI developers  
in Europe have only a  limited market share vis -à-vis their counterparts in the United States and 
China .344 Policymakers and commentators have already raised concerns about powerful multinational 
companies pressuring EU regulators with threats to exit the European market. Given the dominance 
of  U.S. AI companies , these regulators  may face a tough balancing act: regulating multinational AI 
companies while keeping them and their technologies in the Union. Moreover , the enforcement  and 
choice -of-law questions identified above may mute the extraterritorial effect of  the AI Act .345 In view 
of  these challenges and complications, we expect the actual  extraterritorial effect to be more limited 
than the regulation suggests . 
V. KEY LESSONS  
Thus far , we have addressed the emergence  of an international  equilibrium  on copyright and 
AI training , factors  contribut ing to this emergence,  and uncertain ties that may upset  the equilibrium . 
In this Part, we derive six key lessons  from  the cross -country survey  of copyright law developments  
provided in Part II . 
First,  the survey has shown that countries  around  the world  have actively  embrac ed the use of 
copyrighted  works  to train AI models —due to copyright law’s focus on protecting expression , the 
countries ’ eagerness to remain global ly competitive , and their preference for taking the middle  path.346 
Jurisdictions with different legal tradition s, economic  conditions , technological capabilit ies, political  
system s, and cultur al backgrounds  have found ways to reconcile copyright law and AI training. 
Although  ongoing litigation, licensing deals, and legislative and regulatory efforts  have created  
uncertainties ,347 we predict  further  convergence  of copyright  laws across  the world  in the area of AI 
training.  Gone  is a binary  categorical debate  about  the legal ity of  using copyrighted  works  to train AI 
 
341 Note the potential parallel to the need to respect paywalls and comply with machine -readable exclusion headers under 
U.S. copyright law. See Sag, Fairness and Fair Use , supra note 25, at 1920.

347 See discussion supra Part I V. 


THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
55 models . Emerging  instead  is a more  granular  debate  about  the specific  circumstances  in which  the 
unlicensed  use of  copyrighted works for AI training should be allowed  or prohibited . Thus, countries  
eager to update their copyright  laws to facilitate AI training  are well advised  to adopt  some  relevant 
exceptions —whether in the form of  fair use, an express exception for TDM or computational data 
analysis, or something else . The more hesitation they have, the less globally competitive they will 
become . 
Second,  with copyright exceptions to facilitate AI training already in place in most major 
geopolitical powers and the emergence of  a broader international  equilibrium,  major  international  
dispute s over those copyright exception s are unlikely . Because  countries  around  the world are still 
actively exploring ways to finetune their copyright systems to promote  AI training and development , 
it is improbable  that the different  normative choices made by these countries  will rise to the level of 
a major  international  dispute.  In such a state of  flux , it is simply difficult to prove a violation of  an 
international legal obligation . More  importantly,  without  any significant disagreement  between major 
geopolitical  powers  in the area of  AI training , it is hard to envision  any country taking  action  before  
an international adjudicatory body , such as the WTO  Dispute  Settlement  Body.348 Indeed,  because  of  
the United  States’  undisputed leader ship in using  copyright  limitations  and exceptions  to facilitate  AI 
training  and the development of  other copy-reliant technologi es, the chance  of other countries  being  
put on the United States’ Section  301 Watch  List or Priority  Watch  List for emulating th e U.S. approach 
is very slim.349 Countries  that have held back copyright  reform  in the area of  AI training due to their 
fear of  WTO  litigation  or trade retaliation350 should feel confident to move forward . 
Third,  many ways exist  to introduce copyright  limitations  and exceptions  to facilitate AI 
training .351 While increased  globalization  and the prevalence of  international  trade and intellectual 
property  agreements  have created the expectation of , if  not a preference for,  one-size-fits-all 
standards,  no such standards  exist at the intersection of  copyright and AI training . Instead , some 
countries have embrace d open -ended limitations and exceptions, while other s have chosen to develop 
express  exceptions  for TDM or computational data analysis .352 The existence of  these global variations  
348 Cf. Yu, User-Friendly Copyright Regime , supra note 123, at 309  (“[I]t is hard to imagine any country willing to challenge the 
U.S. fair use provision, including the transformative use doctrine, before the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade 
Organization .  . . . Nor is a WTO panel likely to strike down this pro vision.”).  
349 Section 301 permits the U.S. President to investigate and impose sanctions on countries engaging in unfair trade 
practices that threaten the United States’ economic interests, including the inadequate protection and enforcement of 
intellectual property ri ghts. See 19 U.S.C. §§ 2411 –2420. For discussions of the operation of the Section 301 process, see 
generally Joe Karaganis & Sean Flynn, Networked Governance and the USTR , in MEDIA PIRACY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES

350 See Yu, Customizing Fair Use , supra note 69, at 3 (noting the developing countries’ “fear that the introduction of [copyright] 
limitations and exceptions could reduce foreign investment, invite WTO complaints, harm diplomatic relations with 
powerful countries or all of the above”).

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
 56 provides  a rare opportunity  for policy and academic researchers to evaluat e the affordances of  
differ ent copyright legislation for machine  learning  and AI training .353 
Fourth,  the continuous  development  of copyright  limitations  and exceptions  for AI training  
will be affected  by not only developments  within  the intellectual  property  arena —such as copyright  
litigation,  partnership and licensing  deals , and legislative and regulatory efforts —but also outside 
developments.  Although  intellectual  property  policymakers and commentators  have paid considerable  
attention  to the development  of the EU AI Act, it is worth remember ing that non–intellectual 
property issues provide the impetus  behind the drafting of  this regulation.354 Similarly,  much  of the 
newly emerging U.S. legislation  has focus ed on issues ranging from  consumer  protection  to political 
communication to national  security.355 Most AI regulatory  efforts  supported  by U.N. agencies and 
other international  and regional bodies  have also focus ed on issues outside the intellectual property 
domain .356 
Fifth , because generative  AI is still in its nascent  stage  of development , it is too early to tell 
what will happen  in the future.  Although  we are comfortable  predicting  that copyright laws regarding 
AI training will converge  in substance  across the globe , we still anticipate  substantial variation in form. 
It is equally  hard to predict  the future evolution of  AI, including generative AI technology : the 
capabilities and affordances of  this technology  in 202 5 are a far cry from what they were in 2022 . 
Current trends such as agentification ,357 small language models,358 and the use of  synthetic data359 may 
further reduce  the perceived conflict between copyright and AI.  
Finally , this Article  focuses  primarily on the use of copyrighted  works  to train AI models . 
While  this analysis  could  be extended  to cover other  areas  at the intersection of  copyright  and AI, the

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
 57 law on the copyrightability of  AI -generated works seem s to have diverged globally . While  the U.S. 
Copyright Office rejected  a number  of widely reported applications  for registration  of  copyright in 
AI-generated  works ,360 Chinese  courts  and the Korea Copyright Commission  have extended copyright  
protection to the same  type of  work.361 Our prediction of  convergence in the area of  AI training 
therefore does not necessarily extend to other issues at the intersection of  copyright and AI.362 
 
360 See Yu, Autonomous Creation , supra note 252 (collecting these cases); see also  U.S.  COPYRIGHT OFF., COMPENDIUM OF U.S.  
COPYRIGHT OFFICE PRACTICES  § 313.2 (3d ed. 2021) (stating that the U.S. Copyright Office “will not register works 
produced by a machine or mere mechanical process that operates randomly or automatically without any creative input or 
intervention from a human author”) ; U.S.  COPYRIGHT OFF., COPYRIGHT AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE : PART 2: 
COPYRIGHTABILITY  (2025) (providing the second report on copyright and AI, covering the  copyrightability of AI -
generated works ). Nevertheless, the U.S. Copyright Office has recently registered several AI-generated works  based on 
selection, coordination, and arrangement. See, e.g., Edward Lee, AI-Generated Image Received Copyright Registration Based on

THE GLOBALIZATION OF COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS FOR AI TRAINING  
58 CONCLUSION  
It is logical to expect c ountries  with differ ent legal traditions , economic  conditions , 
technological  capabilities,  political  systems,  and cultural  backgrounds  to take diverging  approaches  to 
copyright  law. In the area of AI training,  however,  these  divergent  approaches  have not appear ed as 
many have expected . Even though laws in this area  remain varied in form , they have converged  global ly 
in substance . Thus , even though the world has yet to achieve consensus on copyright and AI training, 
an international equilibrium has emerg ed. 
Because  AI technology  will continue  to evolve  in the near future , sparking  further legal, 
regulatory, technological, and business developments , it remains to be seen whether  and how this 
equilibrium  will be maintained . Regardless  of the outcome,  scrutin izing international copyright  law 
developments  in the area of AI training  will deepen  our understand ing of  how to better harness the 
copyright  system  to advance  AI, including generative AI  technology . Because  some  copyright  
legislation will provide  greater  affordances  for machine  learning  and AI training than others , 
policymakers and commentators should pay greater attention to the  legislation’s  relative strengths and 
weaknesses . Like the design of  AI models and training processes , the design  of  the copyright system 
can play a very important role in the age of  generative AI .
