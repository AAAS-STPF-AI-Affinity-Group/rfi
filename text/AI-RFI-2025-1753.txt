It seem s AI is another way of taking away skilled jobs. If we are looking to keep jobs alive, AI will be taking them . Our arts will not
progress as it grows. If we m ake rules around when AI can be used and restrict it, we are protecting sm all businesses and jobs alike,
which would stim ulate the econom y m ore. The Am erican Dream  is being able to do what you want; we do not need som ething inhum an
taking that dream  from  us.
