General Comment
Any product that m ust willingly steal any and every piece of copyright protected m edia to sim ply function as intended, let alone potentially
selling a product and m aking m oney, shouldn't exist. The m om ent the exem ption to allow one com pany and their product to steal
copyrighted m aterial, copyright no longer holds any m eaning and everything is fair gam e for everyone. This will actively encourage piracy.
And an increase in piracy, will directly result in a decrease in creativity and productivity.
