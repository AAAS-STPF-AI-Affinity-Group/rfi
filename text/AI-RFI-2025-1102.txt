General Comment
Although proprietary AI technology is great for US power, we have seen that open source AI can literally topple m arkets. xAI releases
the old Grok m odel open source whenever it creates a new one. This is a great way to lim it our com petitors and I think we should be
doing everything we can to help the open source AI com m unity. By m aking m odels that com pete with our com petitors free we give the
world tantalizing alternatives to AI m odels that would com pete with our own allowing us to slow down the growth of their AIs. At the
sam e tim e, by fostering innovation in our m ost powerful m odels with the m assive am ounts of resources available in the US we can stay
ahead with our proprietary m odels. By creating the best environm ent possible for open source m odels in the US we can creat a two
pronged approach for keeping com petition outside the US at bay. One prong giving free alternatives to our com petition and one prong,
offering the best of the best through US com panies. We need to foster as m uch innovation as possible in the US open source AI space.
This could be done by investm ent in universities and research institutes.
