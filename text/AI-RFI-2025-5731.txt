General Comment
AI as it is currently being developed steals copyrighted property from  Am ericans and regurgitates it. It uses m assive am ounts of power
and water to create output that is inferior to what hum ans can create. It does not m ake anything useful and destroys livelihoods and jobs. 
If AI developers cannot create a profitable business m odel without stealing from  Am ericans, they need to find another business.
