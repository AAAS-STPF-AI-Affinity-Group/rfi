My main concern with AI capabilities is not with current administration. But from our enemies, I 
am afraid of it. For instance, the current Elon Musk request for a week's worth of productivity 
bullets, POTUS was supportive. However, there was intense disob edience, propaganda, ordering 
employees on military camps to disobey. AI propaganda from enemies is a huge concern. It is 
hard to tell truth from lies with AI How will the Trump administration assure American citizens 
that our military leadership, and gove rnment leadership will not abuse such advanced technology 
to misinform American troops and civilians?
