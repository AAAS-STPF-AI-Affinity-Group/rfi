General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. It is a bubble, and it will burst.
I have friends who are professional gam e designers (huzzah for Steve Jackson Gam es!) and m y wife is a poet. AI profits off of stealing
their work and replicating shoddy knock-off versions which lack the care, understanding of the reader's context and interactions, and
craftsm anship m y hum an loved ones put into their works.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the Am erican public, depriving our youth of learning experiences, and incentivizing laziness.
