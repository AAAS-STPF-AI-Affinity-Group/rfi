General Comment
AI should have no role in the future of Am erica. It is lazy, dangerous tool that seeks to steal the creative products of hum ans to enrich a
few and em power laziness in the m asses. It will destroy education, art, and the ability for citizens to think for them selves, create for
them selves, and earn a living for them selves.
