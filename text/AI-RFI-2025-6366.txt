General Comment
The professionals of the creative industries have been devalued to such an extent that Silicon Valley com panies never thought that they
would have to ask to use our works. Even though artists and writers are not valuable to them , artistic work seem s to be vital. Please to
not validate their theft after the fact. Copyright is a bedrock principle that encourages artists to create and participate in building our
culture and society. Allowing tech firm s to raid our work freely will incentivize the privatization of creativity, and ultim ately hurt the future
of the arts. A m achine can only im itate, it can never innovate. Without a space for hum an-based art, innovation will end.
