General Comment
Allowing the loosening of AI restrictions is a shortsighted m ove that will ultim ately cause the degradation of com m erce in the US. This
allows for the livelihood of a m assive num ber of Am ericans to be tam pered with in ways that will cause them  to not be able to support
them selves or the work that they do, ultim ately funneling m oney to and from  a sm aller set of people's and degrading life for not just those
artists, but for a large num ber of industries that rely on the arts. (To clarify, this will include traditional im age arts, acting of m any kinds,
anim ation, m usic, and m ore). That's not to speak of the cultural downgrade that will occur in the US, as it begins to be seen as a lifeless
country that fails to seek to im prove, and only iterate over itself endlessly. 
There are no legitim ately useful reasons to allow generative AI to have a foothold in any part of our country, as it will sim ply degrade all
facets of life for a quick buck (that will pass, and then leave us worse off than before).
