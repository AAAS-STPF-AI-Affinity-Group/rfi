General Comment
This would have catastrophic short-term  and long term  consequences for all artistic and creative businesses in the US. Allowing AI to
steal with im punity will benefit a sm all handful of tech startups at the expense of every writer, artist, actor, singer, songwriter, director,
cinem atographer living today, and everyone they em ploy. It will flood all m arkets with low quality slop that infringes on copyrights. It will
be the end of art.
You know this is wrong. The only reason it's being proposed is that people in power are friends with those who stand to m ake m oney
from  AI being perceived as m aking progress. But it's a dead end technology. It m ay get 'better', but it will never be able to replace
hum ans. You should not be m aking laws based around the idea that it m ight som eday be able to do som ething it's proven so far incapable
of.
