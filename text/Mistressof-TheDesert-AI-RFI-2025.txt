AI steals from the livelihoods of Americans and profits off of theft. People do not want it. I do NOT want
it.
People are purposely leaving Google as a search engine because of forced AI, using older versions of
windows or switching to Mac, or at the very least disabling it as much as possible. Please stop this
madness. It's overhyped, and the only people who think it's intelligent are those too undereducated for
their current positions. Personally, when I have to search for something on Google and add "-ai" at the
end to get rid of most of the crap. AI is WRONG 60% of the time! This is dangerous.  
While it does have a place, that place is in hyper-specific applications like detecting potential cancer
before humans notice changes, not with language learning models that don't actually learn language
and don't understand real meaning, and simply regurgitate stolen material. Everything AI spews is
garbage. And no, getting to "learn" from stolen material won't make it better.  
I genuinely hope if you do this the random dice roll causes it to regurgitate Disney fan art based input
and OpenAI gets sued by said corporation. Whether it's a major company or an individual creator, this is
a plagiarism machine writ large  that you are giving permission to plagiarize to. Are you prepared to throw
all copyright law whatsoever out the window?  
Can we get that in writing, that no copyright will exist anymore, for anyone, at all, ever again? No? Then
don't do this.
There are so many problems that need solving and we don't have time (or money) to waste like this. If
y'all put as much energy in the climate crisis (which AI absolutely makes worse with it's water guzzling
data centers) we'd all live better.  
End AI now.
