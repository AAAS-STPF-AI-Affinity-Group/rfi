General Comment
The waiving of copyright protections for copyright holders in the m atter of the use of copyrighted m aterial for training data abdicates a
critical protection for rightsholders in an age of increasing levels of autom ated plagiarism . 
Large com panies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic and others seek to obviate such protections in order to rem ove their responsibility
for ensuring properly sought consent for the creators and com panies theirs need to feed their large language m odels.
There m ay be a future for so-called AI tools in the united states, but it will not be built on the willful destructions of the very copyright
protections that have helped build the country's creative econom y.
