General Comment
The current use of AI has been problem atic due to the division of its uses, for one side it has been beneficial as a tool to do im possible or
hard works on hard working labors such as m edicine, engineering, etc. Otherwise others uses of the AI have been of irresponsible or are
outright non beneficial to anything in particular but to replace the creation of hum an culture, these actions have dam aged artists
com m unities due to the cheap use of ai to replace said people pulling them  out of their business. AI is a tool that m ust be used to do what
we can do, not replace just for the m ere fact that it’s cheap and easy, otherwise we could say that the current or even future technological
advancem ents could easy replace all other jobs outside Art. We need the authenticity and soul of art because of it’s uniqueness, not
because it’s m erely a hobby or som ething industrially m ade. Everyone will eventually get tired of the soullessness of AI that it will be
deem ed as a negative thing for com panies and it’s reputation.
So please, stop looking at us like we’re disposable, thanks.
