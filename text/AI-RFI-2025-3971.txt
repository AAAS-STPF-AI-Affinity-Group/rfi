General Comment
Corporations should not be able to bypass copyright laws. AI is trained on m aterial without consent for the owners. Corporations have
always litigiously defended copyright no m atter how slight, even violating obvious fair use laws. They should not be able to bypass the
laws just because the shoe is on the other foot. They have an overwhelm ing advantage against artists already, able to quash legal issues
with their m oney. This will just m ake it worse. Generative AI art is the rich stealing from  the poor, and laws like this will com pletely shut
down num erous industries as artists, m usicians and writers will stop creating works. This in turn will then shut down the generative AI
industry itself, which relies on stealing new works.
