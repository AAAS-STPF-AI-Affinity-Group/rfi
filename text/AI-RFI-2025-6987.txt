General Comment
I am  am ongst those who are in the creative fields and I am  here to say that AI has no reason to be used in such fields. Whether it is
through art, writing, or other m edia as such, Open AI has no place here. Rem em ber: a m achine is taught, not learned. Machines can only
do what they are program ed to do, not learn as they go. There is no logical reason why AI needs to be used in the creative fields. It is a
tool and nothing m ore. It can not be happy; it can not be sad; it can not be angry.
I thank you for your tim e in reading this com m ent.
