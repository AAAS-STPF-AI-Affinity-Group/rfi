General Comment
AI has m ade everything it's used for worse by a lot. I do not want to live in a country that slavishly follows the im possible wet dream s of
silicon valley's technically proficient im beciles, I don't want to see am erican jobs destroyed by m achines, and I don't want to live in a future
governed by artificial intelligence.
