General Comment
This isnâ€™t fooling anyone. Generative AI is a soulless, em pty cancer that steals from  the hard work of creative individuals and will one day
burn and fade into irrelevancy as it deserves. The livelihoods of m yself and m any other Am ericans depend on the ability to create and be
fairly paid for it. OpenAI and any com pany like them  need to do som ething useful for once and keep its grubby hands off of hum an-m ade
work.
