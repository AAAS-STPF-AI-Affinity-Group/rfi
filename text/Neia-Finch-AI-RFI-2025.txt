The first priority action for AI adoption for the US government should
be to avoid adopting privately operated AI. It's bad enough that ElonMusk now has unfettered access to my IRS data. I don't want OpenAI andother private companies to get access too. Even if the data is lockedin government cloud servers, it's potentially problematic -- unlesseveryone who has any access to the AI system has authorization to viewall its training data, since AI systems have leaked PII before, it's apotential leak.
AI involves the neural network pruning less common observations from
the training set (to varying degrees of success). This is not what youwant for systems that need to be sensitive to nuance, which manygovernment systems need to be as part of their legal obligationsagainst discrimination, as well as many other needs. The action planshould therefore be incredibly conservative.
Best regards,
Neia Finch
