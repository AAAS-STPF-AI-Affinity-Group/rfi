General Comment
Google's use of AI and AI Tools is a targeted effort to censor and silence sm all publishers and independent voices that it does not agree
with. Allowing this to happen will extinguish open discourse and ideas, effectively leaving a singular big tech corporation as the sole owner
of all ideas and influence.
Big tech com panies like Google, Meta, and X/Twitter are actively developing AI for com plete control of the narrative. United, these big
tech com panies will dom inate and control the understanding of the world around us. This is dangerous to free thought and free ideas. And
it squashes independent creatives.
Hum ans are creative beings and without copyright protections for content creators on the web, big tech will sim ply take ideas at will. This
will basically shut down hum an creativity as there is no incentive to create any longer. AI and big tech control should not be allowed to
scrape and use data that was created by hardworking people to use for its LLMs.
If Google, X/Twitter/Elon Musk, Meta, and Microsoft are allowed to scrape data and use it freely. It is the end of sm all businesses. Sm all
independent outlets will no longer be able to create and earn. This country was built and is still heavily dependent on sm all business, and if
that goes, then we're left with a sterile product that is void of natural hum anity.
