General Comment
It's im portant to protect the rights and intellectual property of creators across the world. Creators and com panies that create beloved
works of art and m ovies should not be allowed to have their work and ideas taken by AI developm ent without proper com pensations and
protections. Otherwise, what's to stop anyone from  scraping data from  Disney m ovies, using it to create their own Mickey Mouse
content, and selling it without Disney's perm ission or recom pense? What's to keep som eone from  using AI to generate their own
procedurally generated Marvel com ics, whether Marvel wants them  to or not, if those protections for creators don't exist? What's to
protect m y son from  having his character and story and com ic ideas taken and passed through a LLM and resold by other people?
Please consider the im portant of protecting Am erican creators, Am erican com panies, Am erican rights, and Am erican intellectual property.
