General Comment
AI does not deserve special protections under law as the current state of AI profits entirely off of the theft of the intellectual property of
Am ericans. The developm ent of AI is not m ore im portant than protecting the rights of Am erican citizens to legally pursue thieves that seek
to profit off of their work without duly com pensating them . AI's elevated state is nothing m ore than a passing fad pursued only by those
that do not appropriately value the work of Am ericans and would sooner steal from  them  than pay them  for their hard work and cultivated
skills.
AI is not, and under the current industry leaders, will never be able to replace hum ans without causing irreparable harm  to Am ericans. It
has no place in the future of Am erica, and certainly has no place or im portance relating to the National Security of Am erica.
