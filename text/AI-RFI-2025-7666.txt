General Comment
To allow AI to train off copyrighted works for free sets a dangerous precedent in which others are then able to profit off of or m onetize a
private IP. Unless AI is barred from  m aking any profit, there is no way to preserve intellectual properties and copyright while allowing AI
to train on them  without perm ission. 
If a m usician m ust give credits to their use of a sam ple and pay royalties out to that person, then AI m ust pay royalties out to the people
whose works it trains off of. AI would not exist without those works. Thus, the people who contribute should be fairly com pensated.
Thank you.
