General Comment
Either copyright laws should be loosened for all, or not at all. No preference should be given to corporations, and this just reinforces the
Trum p adm inistration's favoritism  towards corporate interests and billionaires rather than prioritizing a fair deal for hard-working Am erican
citizens. Why should corporations get a break from  copyright law but everyday people do not? Unfair! The hyper surrounding AI has thus
far proven to be just that, hype, and it's not the average Am erican citizen who benefits from  that hype.
