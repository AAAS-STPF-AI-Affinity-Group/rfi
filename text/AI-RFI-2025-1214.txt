General Comment
Guardrails and protections are needed to prevent cyber security risks, fraud, and dom estic terrorism . Legal and ethical guidelines are
needed before there is a disaster not after. Our governm ent shouldn't be changing the laws to protect it's m ost powerful lobbyists but
rather should be enforcing the laws m eant to protect it's citizens. This appears to be an attem pt to protect wealthy investors whose
technology is based entirely on stealing the labor of everyone in order to put Am ericans out of work.
