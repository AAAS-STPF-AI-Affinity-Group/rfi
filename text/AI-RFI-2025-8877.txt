General Comment
If Large Language Models cannot be trained without the use of m aterials under copyright, then they should license the m aterials under
negotiated term s with the license holders. It's one of the fundam ental purposes of copyright to allow m aterial to be visible to the public for
its intended purpose, but copying it (as an LLM necessarily does, in a fuzzy form ) is one of the prohibited usages -- by design; this clearly
isn't a fair use exception.
