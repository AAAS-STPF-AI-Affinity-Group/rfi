General Comment
I say no to AI being used to steal from  people protected under copyright. OpenAI being im m une from  being sued for using other people's
work to train their m odel. AI being used in this way not only harm s individual artists and sm all businesses, but it will also harm  bigger
businesses, as all of their creative ideas will be stolen to feed a m achine that can spit out stuff without giving them  credit. People would
struggle to want to buy stuff from  real businesses if AI was used to m ake the stuff they m ake. Doing this will m ake copyrighting anything
alm ost useless as there will be no consequences for AI com panies like OpenAI who steal copyrighted work and can get away with it. Do
not allow this to happen!
