General Comment
Artificial Intelligence has no place in governance due to its unreliability with the best AI being able to answer correctly only ~40% of the
tim e and other AI m odels doing significantly worse.
AI is also showing in early testing to hurt the critical thinking abilities of those who leverage it frequently in place of actually doing work
them selves. This has obvious negative effects for all of us down the line rem aining com petitive on the world stage.
Further, generative artificial intelligence only acts to harm  our cultural output as it steals from  people who actually create and leaves with
just a degenerating copy of original m aterial with random izations done in an incom prehensible way due to m achines having no
com prehension of the hum an experience or even just living linearly through tim e.
It is unreliable, it steals, it hurts our ability to be com petitive. It is also extrem ely wrongly labeled as there is no intelligence involved nor
anything resem bling critical thinking. It is a parrot that cannot even accurately repeat and a random  num ber generator that occasionally
suffers from  innum eracy. It is a parlor trick of a solution in search for a problem  that also hurts everyone who has to suffer its use.
