General Comment
AI databases are grown by using publicly accessible data, that includes copyrighted works and various types of m edia. It is not right for a
com pany to profit off efforts of others without som e form  of contractual obligation or m onetary com pensation. We believe in capitalism ,
the exchange of goods and services where the m eans of production are OWNED. If we as creators do not have the right to own our own
work, then that is not capitalism . That's called COMMUNISM.
