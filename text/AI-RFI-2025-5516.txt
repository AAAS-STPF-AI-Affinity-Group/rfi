General Comment
As a professional visual artist and writer, I am  FLOORED at the brazen IP theft that AI developers have com m itted. Around the world
and across all disciplines, their crim es have been roundly condem ned. They are stealing IP from  individual artists and from  com panies as
enorm ous as Disney, Universal, and Warner Bros.
And for what? A product that has yet to prove itself as m uch m ore than a parlor trick and a m em e generator. It's sucked up billions and
still can't turn a profit. It's a hack looking to solve problem s that don't even exist - but it sure wants to create a whole host of new ones.
Intellectual Property MUST be protected for US businesses to thrive. Tech com panies MUST NOT be given free reign over the
intellectual property of others. Tell them  to stay in their lane and work within the protections of the law!
