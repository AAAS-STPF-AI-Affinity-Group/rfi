General Comment
I do not believe AI is in the best interest of our country’s future. Creatives and other laborers whose livelihoods depend on copyright law
and intellectual property protections will suffer im m ensely if these com panies are allowed to steal artists’ work. Ultim ately, we are all
harm ed if artists and their work are devalued for the sake of AI.
