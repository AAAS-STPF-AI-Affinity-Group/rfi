Out-of-ideas developers created this very expensive, ineffective "solution," now they need to 
invent a problem for it to solve. AI is notoriously inaccurate, horrifyingly inefficient, and largely 
useless. I'm also unhappy with doge's obvious conflicts of i nterest in data mining every person's 
private info and millions of civil servants' emails to train a private market AI system. This is a 
gross misuse of taxpayer dollars to fill the already overfill pockets of billionaires at the expense 
of the American ec onomy.
