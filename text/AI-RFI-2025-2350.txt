General Comment
Generative AI is an abom ination to say the very least. The fact that our governm ent is willing to replace artists with m achines is enough to
m ake m y stom ach churn. There will be irreparable repercussions if these regulations are enacted, and your adm inistration will be
responsible for any fallout endured by future generations. Stop GenAI today.
