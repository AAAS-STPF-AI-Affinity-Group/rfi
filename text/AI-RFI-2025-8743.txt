General Comment
Generative AI directly steals from  the livelihood and wellbeing of Am erican citizens and is being used to generate a profit off of theft. If a
business in any other industry took the hard work of som eone without their perm ission and directly used it to generate a profit, we'd call
that stealing. Why is this any different? Unregulated generative AI absolutely should not have a place in the future of the United States, and
we have a responsibility as one of the m ost powerful nations on the planet to do som ething about it. This country is built on the back of
hard-working, creative individuals - som ething com panies like OpenAI are seeking exclusively to exploit in order to m ake m oney.
