Wiley Response to US AI Action Plan


March 15, 2025 
Subject:  Develop ment of a  U.S. Artificial Intelligence Action Plan  
We appreciate this important  mechanism to provide our feedback in response to the National 
Science Foundation’s (NSF) and Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) request for 
information (RFI) regarding the Development of an Artificial Intelligence Action  Plan. This 
process represents a critical step in creating a balanced framework that harnesses the benefits of 
AI while ensuring robust copyright protections for the creative and research ecosystems.  
Founded in 1807, Wiley is one of the world’s largest publishers and a global leader in research 
and learning. As stewards of knowledge and information for over two centuries, we see artificial 
intelligence as a transformative force capable of driving innovation, unlocking new opportunities, and accelerating progress across industries. When developed and applied responsibly, AI has the potential to enhance efficiency, empower creators, and deliver significant value to businesses and society. By fostering col laboration between stakeholders, we can ensure AI becomes a catalyst for 
American growth and discovery.  
It is ou r firm belief that to be truly effective, any Action Plan seeking to promote AI 
innovation should:  
•Require transparency and  accountability  from  AI developers  to ensure their legal
compliance, support accuracy, and reduce the potential for erroneous output; and
•Respect existing intellectual property protections and require the use of proper licensingfor copyrighted materials in the training of AI language models.
Any framework  should uphold intellectual property rights, transparency, and fair compensation to 
reinforce the foundational principles that drive innovation and creativity in the United States. By promoting responsible AI practices that align with these values, policymakers and industry leaders can adopt a risk- based approach that balances technological innovation with a respect  for IP and 
copyright . Establishing mutually beneficial licensing arrangements, fostering collaboration to stay 
ahead of AI advancements, and proactively managing risks while seizing opportunities will be essential to sustaining a thriving and competitive AI ecosystem  in America.  We look forward to 
working with the United States on these rapidly emergent issues.  
Please fin d our complete response provided on the following page. We remain available for 
any further clarification or discussion as needed.  
Sincerely,  
Deirdre Si lver 
Executive Vice President, General Counsel Wiley  


Disclosure  
Transparency  is essential for a responsible and well -functioning AI ecosystem. The United States 
should establish clear disclosure requirements  for AI developers regarding the sources used to train 
AI models. Without proper oversight, AI systems risk being trained on unauthorized, low -quality, 
or infringing content, undermining both intellectual property rights and public trust in AI -
generated outputs. Some AI models scrape copyrighted materials without permission, generate 
near-verbatim outputs that replic ate original works, and mislead users by directing them to piracy 
sites or producing inaccurate citations. These issues complicate content integrity and intellectual property protections. 
AI developers  should be required  to: 
•Disclose training datasets  to provide visibility into how copyrighted materials contribute
to AI model development;
•Identify copyrighted works used in training , including digital identifiers (e.g., DOI,
ISBN) and the legal basis for use (e.g., commercial license) ;
•Ensure compliance with copyright law , preventing developers from bypassing
established licensing obligations and legal rights reservation mechanisms  through opaque
or unverifiable datasets ; and
•Implement auditing mechanisms  to track and disclose training data sources, including
for downstream providers, ensuring transparency, scientific  integrity, and security in
content usage throughout the value chain.
Rightsholders  should receive timely notification of unauthorized use, with clear pathways for 
addressing concerns. AI -generated content may incorporate copyrighted materials at various 
stages, including inference and retrieval -augmented generation (RAG). W ithout clear safeguards, 
AI-generated derivatives could be widely distributed, diluting the value of original works and 
creating uncertainty regarding ownership and authorship. 
Transparency  measures could align with existing best practices, such as the EU General -Purpose 
AI Code of Practice, which seeks to balance disclosure with business confidentiality. However, any disclosure requirements should be enforceable, ensuring that AI developers provide meaningful and consistent information. 
Attribution  
Attribution should be a mandatory feature of AI outputs, especially when AI -generated content 
mirrors or substantially relies on copyrighted materials. AI developers should be required to ensure that AI -generated outputs reflect accurate attribution and co ntent provenance by: 
•Correctly ci ting original sources , particularly in research and journalism, to reinforce
scientific integrity ;


•Recognizing authorship  to ensure that creators receive proper credit for their
contributions ; and
•Maintaining a clear record  of how content is sourced, transformed, and repurposed to
build trust in AI systems.
Intellectual Property & Copyright Protection  
AI’s rapi d expansion presents opportunities but also raises challenges for creative industries, 
journalism, and research integrity. The United States should ensure that existing copyright law 
continues to protect publishers, authors, and other content creators.  A balanced approach to AI 
development should: 
•Ensure compliance with copyright law , preventing developers from bypassing
established licensing obligations and legal rights reservation mechanisms through opaqueor unverifiable dataset;
•Encourage AI dataset transparency , requiring public reporting on training data sources;
•Support licensing require ments for AI training , ensuring AI developers obtain consent
before using copyrighted works  and allowing rightsholders to control how their content is
used;
•Develop standards for and i mplement provenance tracking , enabling content creators
to verify when their works are incorporated into AI models  and enabling content attribution
and protecting against misrepresentation ; and
•Utilize existing copyright enforcement mechanisms , ensuring AI developers operate
within the bounds of intellectual property law.
AI Training vs. Text and Data Mining  
The United States should distinguish between text and data mining (TDM) and AI training, 
particularly in relation to intellectual property protections. 
•TDM analyzes existing content  to extract patterns , trends, or relationships, typically
producing insights without generating new works.
•AI training  ingests copyrighted materials to generate new works , enabling AI -
generated outputs that may be verbatim or substantially similar to source content.
Applying TDM exceptions to AI training is inappropriate. AI models do not merely analyze 
content—they absorb and reuse it, often producing outputs that replicate protected works. A licensing -based framework would help ensure that intellectual property protections remain intact 
and that AI developers and rightsholders can engage in a structured, fair system for content use. 


Robust Marketplace for Licensure  
A licensing -based framework, rather than an exception allowing AI developers to train on 
copyrighted content without permission, is one important approach for ensuring accountability, 
transparency, and fairness for rightsholders. 
U.S. copyright law does not provide blanket permission for AI training under fair use. The 
February 2025 Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence ruling reinforced this, granting summary 
judgment against unauthorized AI training on copyrighted materials. A licensing framework offers a clear, enforceable approach that  ensures creators are compensated when their works are used in 
AI training ; provides legal certainty for AI developers, reducing litigation risks ; and  enhances 
transparency  by requiring AI developers to disclose training datasets, licensing terms, and the legal 
basis for content use. 
Under a li censing system, AI models can still access high- quality, curated datasets —but only with 
rightsholder consent. AI developers should be required to: 
•Publicly disclose  training datasets to allow verification ;
•Track copyrighted materials  used at various AI stages, including inference and retrieval -
augmented generation (RAG) ; and
•Implement clear attribution standards , ensuring proper recognition where possible.
Requiring ri ghtsholders to opt out of AI training places the burden on creators, rather than on AI 
developers who profit from their works. A framework based on explicit licensing would create a more predictable system that recognizes the value of copyright ed materials  and bolsters American 
innovation. 
Conclusion  
Wiley is committed to a future in which the development and deployment of AI is encouraged and 
embraced, while also supported by legal guardrails that incentivize and support the creation and 
curation of trustworthy research and learning material. Many of those legal guardrails already exist (e.g., licensing), and others need to be refined (e.g., transparency). Wiley’s ultimate mission is to 
serve authors, researchers, learners, and professionals by enabling them to consume and widely disseminate informatio n and knowledge in ways that benefit the world. We must ensure that people 
will not be put at risk under any circumstances, and that the quality and integrity of the works we publish and the valuable services that journals and societies provide are never compromised. 
As with a ny new technology, we must be both visionary and vigilant. We look forward to working 
with the United States on these rapidly emergent issues. Public -private partnerships ––leveraging 
the collective expertise and entrepreneurial spirit of the scien tific ecosystem, including publishers –
–are essential to charting a balanced path forward in which technological progress and the IP -
enabled creativity that fuels it function and flourish together.
