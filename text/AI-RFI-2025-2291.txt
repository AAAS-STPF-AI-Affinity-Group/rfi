General Comment
There is no need for com panies to scrape m aterial they don't own to train AI. They can easily pay people to let them  train AI off their
content. This blatant dism issal of copyright and personal ownership has been going on for too long and endangers the entire creative spirit
of our country. People deserve the right to protect their IP. Not to m ention that ignoring copyright wholesale m eans AI will be able scrape
from  other AI program s, creating a cannibalizing situation. 
The need to m atch China's innovations does not justify ignoring copyright and allowing AI com panies to steal from  writers and artists and
even everyday people's personal discussions/im ages at will. It is extrem ely invasive and determ inantal to people's social wellbeing.
