General Comment
This is a terrible idea. As a writer and as som eone who has worked with professional artists, these fields need to be protected from
generative AI. Freelance writers and artists and sm all com panies such as the video gam e com pany I currently work for struggle enough
without having their work stolen by AI that will just shake it around and regurgitate it like a kaleidoscope.
