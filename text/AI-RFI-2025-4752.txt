General Comment
What generative AI has invented is technology that could be a tool if used in the bounds of law, utilizing licensing agreem ents, etc. for
training tools. Instead, com panies like Meta and OpenAI have used it to invent a new technique for intellectual property theft and art theft,
pulling off the biggest art theft in 70 years. No tool nor tool m aker should be above the law.
