General Comment
I do not believe generative Artificial Intelligence holds a place in the future of the United States to any capacity whatsoever. AI steals from
m y livelihood as a legal Am erican-born citizen as a technology that inherently profits off of pure theft. AI is vastly overrated and
m isunderstood for what it is/does, and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
