General Comment
Having AI com pletely free to train on things they don't even own will just lead to a m ess for all creative works. It will be m uch harder to
ascertain what is truly m ade by our fellow people. People will lose out on jobs because the AI will sim ply replace them . This is only going
to m ake things far worse for all the people in the creative field. Many people who sell their art in any location will have to com pete with
people who don't even share any passion in this field. They will have to com pete with people who are just aim ing to rip people off. Also
our way to learn with art will perish as a result too. We need to stop the AI from  ruining the one thing we as people can do freely and that
is self expression. Do not push AI further please.
