General Comment
AI can not and should not be allowed to review copyrighted m aterial, no m atter what. It will com pletely stifle creativity and potentially ruin
hundreds if not thousands of jobs. Nobody wants this, nobody wants these glorified dogwater "AI" to invest our com m unities and steal
livelihoods from  other people. This CANNOT happen.
