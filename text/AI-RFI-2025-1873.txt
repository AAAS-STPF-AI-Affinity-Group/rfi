General Comment
Hi, as a born and raised Am erican citizen who has grown up with m any creative friends and who has his own inspirational drive, I speak
out. One of the key things that m akes the United States of Am erica so great has been its artistic form s that have been fostered over the
centuries. Writing, painting, drawing, digital art, video gam es, and the m ovie industry all have been given a pedestal here in this country.
Supporting “AI” in the m anners proposed will hurt not just Am erican spirit, but disgrace our legacy and to those who are financially astute,
our econom y even m ore. There have been plenty of troubles born out of it already, m any of which are highly costly. So, to reiterate, don’t
use “AI” not just because it’s inefficient but because it is also not Am erican.
