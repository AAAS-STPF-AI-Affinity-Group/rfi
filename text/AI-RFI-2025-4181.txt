General Comment
Dear NSF,
I am  an artist and pharm acist. AI, no m atter the intentions, cannot replace the critical decision m aking and creative skills of a hum an being.
Generative AI creates an excessive power cost which hurts the electric bills. Generative AI uses up too m uch water, which is already a
concern. Most im portantly, it drives artists to no longer create due to how AI is gathered off of previous works without consent. I am
firm ly against AI, and instead hope that regulations and oversight increase, not decrease.
