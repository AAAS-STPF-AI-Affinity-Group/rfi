General Comment
The Am erican People do not want AI
The Am erican People do not NEED AI
The Am erican People's NEEDS should com e before the WANTS of a com pany.
It is unacceptable that generative AI is getting allowances to steal the works of people and the Am erican People are having rights stripped
away on a daily basis.
There is no good reason for this order. It is all about Trum p getting m ore pocket m oney from  com panies so they can m ake m ore m oney
with no regulation.
The Am erican People are suffering and the billionaires are thriving and things need to change.
