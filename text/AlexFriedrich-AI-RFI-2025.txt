AI training should bot be considered fair use.   Proponents like to compare the training og AI to
someone seeing a work of art and being inspired by it.   But AI programs are not people, they
are devices that create art or text strings.   Using someone else's art or writings to train an AI is
more like stealing blueprints than being inspired.
