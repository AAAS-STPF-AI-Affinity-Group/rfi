General Comment
I do not want hum an effort and creativity be processed through AI and be spat out as a soulless product for the greedy and the scum s to
use. It holds no value now and it will hold no value for the future. It is a m ockery of the hum an progress, it spits to all effort m ade by
people who picked up the pen and m ade the effort to put their vision in the world.
