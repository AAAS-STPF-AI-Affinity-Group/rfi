General Comment
I don't believe AI holds a place in the future of the US, if anything it m akes things m ore vulnerable to theft. AI steals from  m y livelihood as
an Am erican and profits off of theft, not allowing any protection or com pensation for artists. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the
Am erican public.
