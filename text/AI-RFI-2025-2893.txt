General Comment
No corporation deserves unfettered access to others' works without due com pensation. Additionally Generative AI and LLMs are largely
resource-intensive novelties, incapable of separating truth from  fiction or perform ing any work with a degree of success even rem otely
com parable to the results produced through hum an craftsm anship. Grant NO access to OpenAI or other such services, if not for these
reasons then because these endeavors constitute nothing m ore than a fools errand that will cost several hundred billion dollars that will
never m eaningfully be paid off.
