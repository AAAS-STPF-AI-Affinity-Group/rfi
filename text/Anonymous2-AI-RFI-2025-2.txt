Hello. I do not believe AI has a place in our future. You see, AI does not create things on its own, it just grabs things
from other people that are relevant and puts it out in a new format without credit. If a human did this, it would becalled plagiarism. Why would we allow something that steals from the people whom it serves? If a human weredoing this, action would be taken against them. Yet instead we know what AI does and are removing the guardrailsso it can steal freely and without consequence. All I ask is that we keep the copyrights in place so that way AI cannot steal from the people for free. Thank you for your time.
