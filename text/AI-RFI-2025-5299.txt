General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. It steals from  m y livelihood and the livelihoods of countless Am ericans, profiting
out of nothing but theft and deceit. 
It is an overhyped + unstable bubble just waiting to pop; other countries are starting to have regulations for AI for a reason. DO NOT
LET AI COMPANIES BE ABLE TO USE OUR DATA UNRESTRICTED.
