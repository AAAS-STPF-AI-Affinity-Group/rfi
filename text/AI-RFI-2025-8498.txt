General Comment
Loosening restrictions on AI com panies will do nothing to bring down their cost of developm ent. Any U.S. com pany worth their salt will
never let a chance to keep their price the sam e or raise it when faced with an circum stance that calls to lower it. Beyond that given how
badly U.S. AI com panies were upstaged by deepseek in term s of cost, this half assed effort will not be effective and once again lower the
opinion of the public on AI com panies once again. The only real way to get com panies to work harder and cheaper it to raise direct
restrictions on them , the governm ent should bring them  to heel and have these com panies organized and working for the actual benefit of
the nation.
