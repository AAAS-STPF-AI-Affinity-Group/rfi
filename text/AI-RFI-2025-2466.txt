General Comment
I have seen no evidence that AI based industries or decisions are m aking Am erican corporations m ore profitable and better functioning.
To date, incorporation of AI appears to have entered the private sector solely to justify layoffs and provide worse service to custom ers
and users of governm ent services. AI training has been accom plished prim arily with theft of online resources and AI proponents have seen
no accountability for this action. I do not support any governm ent investm ent in AI resources without FIRST creating laws for energy
m anagem ent strategies and system s for the enorm ous power requirem ents of AI data centers and creating protection and laws for sale and
license for creative industries that have been robbed for years by AI com panies scraping the internet.
