General Comment
Do NOT give OpenAI free reign to ignore copyright law. True AI dom inance would be done by using it to enhance scientific endeavors in
fields such as m edicine, chem istry and astrophysics. It would NOT be established by stealing and scraping data to replace creative artistic
endeavors, and would run the very real risk of deliberate sabotage out of spite from  citizens that feel rightfully betrayed.
