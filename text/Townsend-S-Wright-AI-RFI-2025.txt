Do not permit AI companies to legally steal out data and our craft. As an artist and writer I firmly and unequivocally
reject the premise that generative AI should be permitted to steal our intellectual property in order to replace us.However advocates may laud the technology, it is not creating anything, it is plagiarizing. What it does is far closerto tracing or cobbling together already extant images—well established violations of copyright law—than they areto human creativity. Do not grant OpenAI or any other machine learning company the legal immunity to pillagehuman creativity in the name of pointless, exploitative slop.Thank you,Townsend S. Wright
