General Comment
Changing copyright for genAI will ruin lots of m ajor corporations intellectual property as well as sm all businesses and artists. Disney will
not want their film s scraped for genAI as m uch as a hobby artist posting their work online. Keep the laws as they are, and let genAI
com panies figure out how to com pete without stealing.
