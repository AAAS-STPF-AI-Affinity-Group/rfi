General Comment
I do not want AI com panies to be im m une from  copyright infringem ent lawsuits. I am  a working m usician and it is hard enough to m ake a
living as it is. Art in all of its form s is an im portant part of Am erican culture and this would take it out of the hands of the people. Giving AI
im m unity from  copyright infringem ent would not be good for the people of this country that you represent, it would only be effective in
raising the wealth and capital for corporations who already have m ore than their fair share of what belongs to the people. 
Please do not let AI technologies steal from  artists.
