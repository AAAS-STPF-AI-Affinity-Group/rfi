General Comment
AI holds no place in the future of the US. It steals from  the livelihood of m yself and m y neigbors as Am ericans, profiting from  theft.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public, it is a speculative m arket waiting to pop akin to cryptocurrency and
NFTs. Its rife with false prom ises to fool the public, om inous legal problem s, and presents m assive data security concerns.
