General Comment
AI, as it's currently being used, steals work m ade by other people and passes it off as original. It destroys the livelyhood of artists who get
their hard work pilfered and fed into AI trash. It is quite frankly un-Am erican to allow people who do no work at all to be able to steal
from  hard working artists for their own gain.
