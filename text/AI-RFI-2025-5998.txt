General Comment
Existing copyright law m ust be m aintained and protected in the age of AI. To dism antle copyright protections for the tem porary and short-
term  benefit of corporations is a resoundingly bad econom ic idea; not only will it m ake all pursuit of creative work as a way to m ake a
living in the US untenable, it will turn Am erican corporate claim s of copyright protection into a global laughingstock. If AI cannot exist
without pillaging private work, then the m arkets should not support it. If the public good of AI is deem ed to outweigh private control, then
it ought to be put in the hands of public control at a rate of just com pensation as dictated in the constitution, not handed over for free to
profit corporations.
