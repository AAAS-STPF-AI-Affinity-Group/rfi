General Comment
Making any organization exem pt from  copyright law is an incredibly bad Idea.
Machines sutch as AI are to be identified as very specialized tools, not as creative entitys. 
In the event that a data m odel trains off a party, or organization's IP without their consent; the party that's developed and deployed it m ust
be heald responsible for any of their autom ated breaches of IP law.
