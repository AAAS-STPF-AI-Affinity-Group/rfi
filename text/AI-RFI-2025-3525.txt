General Comment
Enhancing Am erica's "AI dom inance" will not be possible without devaluing our entire hum an population. Am erican culture, art, tourism --
this is all dependent on the passionate contributions of the Am erican people. None of this can be m eaningfully replaced by algorithm s. It
will be disastrous for our nation's artists and creators to allow AI com panies to run am ok without legal consequences for taking from  their
work. Holding AI to a separate standard than hum an beings in regards to copyright law is unjust and unwise. What precedent does this
set? What other laws and standards will AI not have to abide by, while the Am erican people suffer the consequences? Our governm ent is
here for one thing: the people. Devaluing the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of artists within our own country will ruin careers. It will
ruin lives. To what end? Do not turn a blind eye to the people of this country as they beg not to be tossed aside by their own elected
officials for the sake of soulless, purposeless, digital waste. Please do not forget the well-docum ented effect the so called "AI industry" has
had on our environm ent. We have m ade so m uch progress in the last few decades to reverse the effects of clim ate change. AI could undo
that progress in only a fraction of the tim e. If we m ust m ove forward with AI developm ent, a legal division m ust be established between
AI developm ent for art and AI developm ent for tools, industry, m ilitary, etc.
