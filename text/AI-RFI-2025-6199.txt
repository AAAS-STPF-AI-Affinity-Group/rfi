General Comment
I do not agree with the decision to suppress copyright law for the sake of perpetuating a system  that will only be used for wide-spread
theft and m isinform ation. It is a system  that destroys jobs and devalues hum an effort, tells the working people that they are lower than a
digital ball-in-a-cup with the staying power of a m ayfly. Indulging this any further is a waste of m oney, m orale, and resources.
