General Comment
Please do not accept this as the future, there won’t be any if you allow this. Many profitable m arkets will suffer and go in ruin, the
presence of A.I trying to replace artists will destroy the appeal of m any consum ers which will dam age profitability and worst of all, if
aren’t careful about how we use our technology today there won’t be a m arket or outlet to depend on for businesses
