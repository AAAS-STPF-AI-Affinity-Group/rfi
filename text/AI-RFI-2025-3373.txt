General Comment
AI is theft, I do not think we should be investing as m uch energy, tim e, and m oney into it as we are. Social Security, Education, and
Medicaid are far m ore worthwhile investm ents than whatever Mr. Musk and the other billionaires want to waste our m oney and resources
on. Give the power back to the people. Deport Elon Musk. He is a crook and a crim inal. He is not an Am erican. Trum p is a Liar and
Traitor and should have never had any power. They do not care about the struggles of everyday people. The m ajority of PEOPLE should
be deciding on things like this, not the m ajority of Wealth, and the people HATE AI!!!
