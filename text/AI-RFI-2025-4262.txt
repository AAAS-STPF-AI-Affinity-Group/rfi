General Comment
AI of this nature is not necessary for the US to develop. To allow this is a nefarious precedent on the integrity of all future Am erican m edia
and will spell disaster for copyright holders. The speculative AI industry wants nothing m ore than a federal blank check to acquire as m uch
learning data as they can without having to adhere to our pre-existing system  of copyright.
