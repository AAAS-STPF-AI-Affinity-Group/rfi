General Comment
This proposal is definitely a bad idea. Overall, OpenAI generates results based on inform ation the program  finds. Therefore, the program
is taking ideas and visuals from  other individuals. This fact will cause issues in regard to copyright issues on the corporate level and on the
individual level. Additionally, AI program s, such as OpenAI, are known to provide inaccurate inform ation. This fact will be harm ful to
people trying to uncover accurate inform ation. Overall, I urge the m em bers of our governm ent to vet and against OpenAI.
