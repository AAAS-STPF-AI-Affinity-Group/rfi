General Comment
Ai is theft. It is not som ething that should even be considered in the U.S future. It steals from  artists trying to m ake a living just so it can be
a "convient and cheap" option for com panies. If this goes through what about future careers? No one would want to go into any creative
fields. Art, writing, etc anything of this nature should be practiced and celebrated even. What kind of world would our future generations
live in where all of that could be done with a single sentence? Not challengeing them selves creatively nor at all. Not to m ention the
ecological im pact of training AI as it currently stands consum es ridiculous am ounts of energy and, in m any cases, precious freshwater
resources to cool these training centers.
Please reconsider this. It isn't as sim ple as you m ay think. People's livelihoods, careers and creative freedom  are at high risk if this is
passed.
