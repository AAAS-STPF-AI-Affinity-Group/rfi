General Comment
AI should not be allowed to disregard copyright law and steal art from  non consenting artists. This will ruin the econom y, funneling m oney
upwards and stealing from  hard working artists who do all the work to only have it stolen and reproduced cheaply and badly for no
com pensation. AI needs to follow copyright laws, and AI trained on copyrighted m aterial should have to give com pensation to the artists
affected.
