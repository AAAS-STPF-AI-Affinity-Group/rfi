General Comment
I believe that AI has a place in helping hum ans do things that they are not good for; investigating gigantic data sets, working through
thousands of iterations of a problem  quickly, or reviewing stream ing data for patterns in real tim e. 
I believe that AI is best suited towards narrow applications - look at how protein folding has been pushed forwards by leaps, or how we
are actually using it to find lost civilizations by looking at satellite data. 
Hum ans are very good at the arts. They are very good at writing creatively. These are the things that m oved our culture forwards,
expanded our m inds. AI can m im ic this, but it can never replace it. It's always "is this good enough?" while presenting a vision that is, on
the surface, acceptable, but a deeper review shows the flaws and betrays the hum an contract between art and artist. 
The only reason to replace art with AI is to save m oney. It isn't to advance the hum an race.
The only reason for a hum an to abdicate their agency and intelligence to an AI is to save m oney, and to m ake the dum bing down of
society m ore fiscally palatable.
Anyone working with AI should be keeping this in m ind - that there are actions and behaviors that m ake hum ans what we are - creative
and intelligent. Abdicating our hum anities is the first step towards extinction.
