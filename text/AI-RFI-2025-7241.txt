General Comment
AI has no place in our governm ent without consent, com pensation and credit for every writer or artist that the system  is trained upon.
Otherwise it is nothing but theft and destruction of copyright.
Please do not do this to the m illions of Am ericans who m ake their livings as writers and artists. Please do not do this to Am ericans who
will consum e this slop.
The tech billionaires that thrive on bubbles should not be entrusted with our data, our creative work and our culture. 
Thank you.
