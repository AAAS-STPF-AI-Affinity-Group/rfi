General Comment
Re: National Science Foundation’s Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
I am  an artist, educator, and parent, and I am  deeply concerned by this proposal.
This adm inistration’s AI Action Plan proposes the unlawful seizure of personal and licensed content, and to then hand that content to for-
profit enterprise. When wealthy and powerful com panies can steal and profit from  what we create, there is no path for recourse for
creators. If creativity is devalued, creative jobs cease to exist. 
There should be an opt-in m odel to subm it personally owned content to LLMs, so that we can decide when and where our work is used
by AI system s.
The AI Action Plan should also require transparency from  the com panies that own and operate LLMs, requiring them  to disclose what
m aterial is in their training datasets, and label what content is AI generated.
Thank you for your consideration.
