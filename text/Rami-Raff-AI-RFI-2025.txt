This measure is foolish and dangerous. On a purely mercenary level this measure will be bad for US tax revenue and
exports. Why would anyone with creative enterprise or artist want to generate their own work in America if theyknow their work can be stolen and copied free from any kind of legal reprisal. Why are we giving tech companieswho steal material more legal rights than the artists and makers responsible for that work in the first place? Are wenot Americans? Don’t we believe in a marketplace for workers? Machines aren’t workers!
  Can this administration
not be evil or stupid just one time?
Thank you,Rami Raff
