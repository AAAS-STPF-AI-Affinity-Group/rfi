General Comment
Generative AI does not constitute a special exem ption to existing copyright laws. Even large corporations will experience hardship as a
result of any loosening of constraints on the ability of copyright law to protect intellectual property for the purposes of training large-
language m odels. Sm aller creators and com panies will be even m ore heavily im pacted. Generative AI is a solution in search of a problem
and will not m aterially benefit Am erica as a nation or its people.
