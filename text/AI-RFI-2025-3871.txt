General Comment
It is very clear that this is an attem pt to m ake it so that all AI based com panies don't ever have to be held accountable for the m assive
am ount of dam age that AI is doing to the livelihoods of peoples in m any different industries across the world. 
The idea that "AI" is just doing another version of what hum ans do is blatantly ignoring the fact that AI has to be program m ed AND
trained. The program m ers are responsible for the stealing that they do. Data being accessible does not m ake it "publicly available for use"
for everyone able to see it. AI com panies should not be given a route to bypass that just because what they m ake is AI. 
Copyright laws just being guardrails and regulations keeping AI from  achieving its potential is a laughable idea at best. None of these AI
com panies have ever been profitable and at no point have they served our country as a public good. This executive order is blatantly
ignoring the fact that these com panies have already been acting like copyright laws don't exist, and it's very clear the only purpose of such
an order is so they can keep acting in such a m anner.
The bottom  line is that this technology was wholly developed to steal from  Am ericans like m e, and it has only gotten this far because of the
speculative tech industry.
