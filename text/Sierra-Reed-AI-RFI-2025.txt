Good morning,
Lowering AI restrictions will greatly harm the livelihoods of many American workers,
particularly those working in creative industries. Also, a great deal of AI is currently trainedon the hard work of individuals who did not consent to their work being used in this manner,especially when the goal of this technology (in many spaces) is to replace these very peoplethroughout a number of industries. There is a great deal of potential for AI to aid us in anumber of settings (like healthcare), but right now the mismanagement of it is far morerampant, and protections should be in place to make sure everyday workers are not at risk oflosing their jobs and having their work stolen.
 
Thank you for your time,Sierra Reed, AuDAustin, TX
