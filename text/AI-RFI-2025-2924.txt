General Comment
Creatives of all industries rely on their IPs as their livelihood and lifeblood. Allowing AI to run ram pant will destroy these industries, and it
will have a ripple effect - m ovies, com ics, art, even som ething as sim ple as advertising, inform ational posters, EVERYTHING will be
affected. Don't do this. AI should not have free reign over anything and everything, especially not copyrighted m aterial. AI com panies
should not get away with the m ass sourcing of data. This is the allowance of theft, plain and sim ple.
