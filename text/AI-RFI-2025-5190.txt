General Comment
Giving AI com panies access to anything in the public space is grounds to treat it then as a public good. If AI com panies are willing to treat
its m odels as a public utility that any citizen can access as needed, then sure, let them  use public inform ation.
However, private works retain their copyright and privileges regardless. We live in a country of contract law. Using som eone else's works
without perm ission is a violation of these sorts of laws. If AI cannot survive without these works, then it cannot survive in the legal
fram ework of the world we've chosen to live in and need not exist.
