General Comment
I view the theft of artwork to train ai as a blatant copyright infringem ent. These com panies need to be held responsible for their theft of
artist’s jobs and work. The fact that these com panies and their users are so blatantly profiting off of artists’ hard work and creativity is
disgusting. Artist’s work m ust be respected as their right to not be used against them .
