General Comment
AI-generated content such as text, im ages, video, or audio are a deliberate attem pt to cut real, working artists and authors out of the
creation process in favor of turning a m ore im m ediate profit. Furtherm ore, these AI generation m odels are trained on thousands of illegal
copies of stolen copyrighted content from  existing corporations such as Disney, Warner Media, Microsoft, Sony, and m ore. To further
enable this behavior from  OpenAI and other generative AI producers would be a highly detrim ental blow to the United States econom y,
where thousands of working artists, authors, editors, and photographers who were already struggling to find work will be out of a job,
replaced by robots who are trained on the artists and authors' own stolen content. As a citizen of this country, I im plore that you think of
the weight that a deregulation of this standard would carry, and the im pact it would pose on the average working-class US citizen. Thank
you.
