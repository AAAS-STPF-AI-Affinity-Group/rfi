General Comment
I feel that there should not be any sort of m ajor priority put on developing AI. I feel that it is a way that false inform ation can be generated
and spread to sway people to believe and follow inform ation or ideas that are not accurate. There needs to continue to be actual research
and fact checking on any inform ation/technology that is going to be presented to the population. I feel that AI will present a lot of false
ideals am ongst the population that very well could cause unrest and tension as well as give false hope and in a sense spread lies. The
reason for this is that the people that are trying to develop AI for their individual reasons will easily be able to m ake things look or seem
the way that they feel regardless of the outcom e.
