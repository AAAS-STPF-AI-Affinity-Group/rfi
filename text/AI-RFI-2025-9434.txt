General Comment
The use of so-called generative AI steals work from  countless hardworking Am ericans. AI does not create, it steals, it scrapes, it
im personates real writers, artists, photographers, and other creators without attribution or com pensation.
Because it can only scrape, appropriate, and synthesize what others have already created, the work AI produces will always be
substandard, a m ere copy of a copy. It does not create jobs, it steals them  and gives back shoddy approxim ations. It can’t accurately
answer questions, only respond to requests with carbon copy responses. 
The trem endous water and power used by AI’s plagiarism  m achines are m ore than the United States can provide and we will never see
an adequate return on an investm ent in it.
I urge you to prevent the use of AI in scraping, copying, and destroying the copyrighted works and intellectual property of workers in
Am erica and beyond. Thank you.
