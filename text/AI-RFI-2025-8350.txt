General Comment
A problem  with generative AI is that it can be used to falsify evidence. Even outside a court, people can m ake im ages and videos of
people doing stuff theyâ€™ve never done; dangerous, slanderous stuff. Along with blatant plagiarism , it threatens the sanctity of the Am erican
people.
