Ensuring AI Leadership While Safeguarding Against Illicit 
Exploitation 
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is fundamental to America’s economic competitiveness, 
national security, and technological advancement. The United States has long been a 
global leader in AI research and innovation. As we continue to develop and deploy 
cutting-edge AI capabilities, we must also recognize and mitigate the ways in which 
adversaries and illicit actors may seek to exploit these technologies. 
Historically, criminals and illicit networks have been early adopters of transformative 
technologies, leveraging new tools to enhance fraud, cybercrime, and ﬁnancial 
misconduct. AI is no exception. While the United States must foster innovation and 
maintain leadership in AI development, we must also ensure that these technologies 
do not provide an advantage to illicit actors, including those engaged in ﬁnancial 
crime, cyber-enabled threats, and national security risks. 
This submission outlines critical policy actions to strengthen America’s AI leadership 
while mitigating the risks posed by adversarial use of AI. By embedding security, 
transparency, and resilience into the AI ecosystem from the outset, we can ensure that

innovation ﬂourishes while protecting national security, ﬁnancial integrity, and public 
trust. 
AI as Both a Tool for Good and a Weapon for Crime 
AI is a transformative force, driving advancements across industries, from improving 
healthcare access and climate modeling to increasing security and operational 
efﬁciency. However, this same technology is also being weaponized for criminal 
activity, posing signi ﬁcant risks to global security and economic stability. Malicious 
actors are increasingly leveraging AI to conduct fraud, execute cyberattacks, 
manipulate ﬁnancial markets, and deploy sophisticated misinformation campaigns. 
Threat Landscape: The Rise of AI-Enabled Financial Crime 
TRM Labs' research indicates that AI is increasingly being exploited for: 
● AI-Powered Scams: AI-generated phishing campaigns, romance scams, and 
social engineering attacks that bypass traditional fraud detection mechanisms. 
● AI-Driven Ransomware: Automated malware operations that leverage AI to 
optimize payload distribution and dynamically adapt encryption techniques. 
● Supercharged Fraud Networks: AI removes human bottlenecks in fraudulent 
schemes, enabling mass-scale impersonation, credit fraud, and money mule 
recruitment. ● AI-Powered Cyber Laundering: Machine-learning models are being used to 
automate illicit transaction layering, including AI-driven mixers and cross-chain 
swaps. ● Deepfake Financial Deception: AI-generated synthetic identities are fueling 
fraudulent transactions, corporate espionage, and insider trading. 
● Adaptive Cyberattacks: AI-driven malware autonomously learns and adapts, 
bypassing security measures at ﬁnancial institutions and government agencies. 
AI’s ability to mimic human interactions, generate synthetic identities, and conduct 
large-scale attacks at unprecedented speeds has exponentially increased the 
complexity of combating ﬁnancial crime. Without robust security measures, the U.S. 
risks AI being exploited at a scale that undermines economic stability and national 
security.

Leveraging Blockchain Intelligence and AI to Mitigate Risks 
AI for Financial Crime Prevention 
Blockchain intelligence, enhanced with AI, is a crucial tool for tracking and mitigating 
AI-enabled ﬁnancial crime. By integrating AI with blockchain forensics, law 
enforcement, regulators, and ﬁnancial institutions can: 
●Detect suspicious transaction patterns linked to illicit activities.
●Enhance forensic investigations by mapping complex money laundering
networks.
●Monitor emerging threats in AI-driven ﬁnancial crime and fraud.
●Identify synthetic identities and deepfake-driven ﬁnancial manipulation.
●Automate anomaly detection in blockchain transactions to ﬂag illicit activities.
●Use behavioral analytics to predict emerging AI-assisted ﬁnancial crimes.
●Detect AI-driven money laundering tactics through real-time pattern recognition.
These tools allow for real-time monitoring and response to emerging threats, ensuring 
ﬁnancial security while enabling AI-driven innovation. 
Recommendations for AI-Driven Financial Crime Prevention 
1. Ensure Law Enforcement Has the Tools and Training Necessary
Federal agencies must invest in AI-powered investigative tools to ensure that law 
enforcement has the capabilities to identify and counter AI-assisted ﬁnancial crime. 
Training programs should be developed to enhance AI literacy among ﬁnancial crime 
investigators, equipping them with the tools needed to detect and disrupt AI-enabled 
threats. 
2. Allocate Budget for AI-Focused Financial Crime Prevention
Congress should allocate dedicated funding for AI-driven cybersecurity and ﬁnancial 
crime prevention initiatives, ensuring agencies have the necessary resources to combat 
emerging AI threats effectively. 
3. Strengthen FinCEN’s Capacity to Address AI-Driven Illicit Finance
Page 3 


As AI-enabled ﬁnancial crime evolves, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
(FinCEN) must be properly staffed and resourced to address the increasing complexity 
of illicit ﬁnance cases involving AI, cryptocurrency, and cross-border transactions. 
Enhanced collaboration between FinCEN, private-sector intelligence ﬁrms, and law 
enforcement will be essential. 
4. Use AI and Blockchain Intelligence Offensively to Combat Rogue
Nation-States and Illicit Networks
AI should be deployed proactively to track and dismantle illicit ﬁnancial networks tied 
to rogue nation-states and transnational criminal organizations. AI-driven intelligence 
tools should be leveraged to identify and sanction entities exploiting AI for illicit 
activities, ensuring that adversarial actors do not gain a technological advantage over 
U.S. enforcement efforts. 
5. Implement AI Risk Controls for Financial Systems
AI-driven ﬁnancial systems must be equipped with built-in security measures to detect 
and mitigate AI-generated risks. Regulatory agencies should: 
●Develop AI threat intelligence frameworks for ﬁnancial markets.
●Require AI fraud detection tools to be integrated into cryptocurrency exchanges
and ﬁnancial institutions.
●Strengthen AI-driven behavioral risk modeling to identify and prevent illicit
ﬁnancial activities in real time.
6. Expand Public-Private AI Threat Intelligence Sharing
Collaboration between government agencies and private-sector intelligence ﬁrms must 
be expanded to improve AI-driven threat intelligence sharing. Initiatives such as 
Chainabuse, the largest repository of fraud and scams in crypto, and the Third-Party 
Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU) serve as prime examples of successful public-private 
cooperation in combatting AI-driven ﬁnancial crime. 
Conclusion 
Page 4 


AI presents both a signi ﬁcant opportunity and a growing challenge in ﬁnancial security. 
By integrating AI with blockchain intelligence, ﬁnancial institutions, regulators, and 
national security agencies can build resilient defenses against evolving threats. TRM 
Labs is committed to working alongside policymakers, regulators, and industry leaders 
to shape AI-driven security measures that ensure ﬁnancial integrity while mitigating 
risks. 
Addressing AI-enabled ﬁnancial crime through proactive policy measures, dedicated 
resources, and technological collaboration will be key to securing the future of the 
ﬁnancial ecosystem. By embedding safeguards into AI innovation from the outset, the 
United States can maintain its leadership in AI while ensuring that these technologies 
are not exploited by illicit actors to undermine national security and economic stability.
