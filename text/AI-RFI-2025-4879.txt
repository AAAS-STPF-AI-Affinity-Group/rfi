General Comment
Please, just respect existing copyright laws. No one, especially a third-party data scraper, should be able to copy and sell existing,
protected works, whether it be from  big nam es like Disney, Warner Bros, Am azon, Universal, etc (and all their associated IPâ€™s and
stakeholders) or from  sm aller indie artists literally just trying to get by. Defend studios, producers, and creatives of all sizes and m edia
types. AI should not be allowed to steal existing copyrighted work, m uch less PROFIT off of it. Copyright as a word spells it out: the
RIGHT to copy. No one has given any AI the right to reproduce their work. No one ever would.
