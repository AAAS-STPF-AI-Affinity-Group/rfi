General Comment
AI and LLM tools only work when fed enough data, but they should not be allowed to freely access content created by actual hum an
beings. This is in direct violation of copyright laws and allows AI com panies to profit off of the hard work of people producing actual
products. Overriding a person's individual creative property rights for the profits of corporations is antithetical to the foundational
principles of Am erica. If technology com panies want access to the data to im prove their tools, they need to pay for it just like anyone else.
Anything else is theft of intellectual property for private gains.
