General Comment
It's m y belief that the sourcing of (hum an-m ade) works by artificial intelligence freely and without the crediting of the creators of those
original works is not only artistically and m orally indecent, but seem ingly a legal nonissue. Why this is a discussion genuinely confounds m e.
The open theft on which generative artificial intelligence is based seem s quite clearly a breach of the m ost basic of ownership laws.
Couple this indecency with the catastrophic toll on the environm ent that AI-use projects, as well as the culture of fraudster behavior that
perpetuates m uch of the AI com m unity and it seem s the responsible thing to curtail any advances in this respect.
