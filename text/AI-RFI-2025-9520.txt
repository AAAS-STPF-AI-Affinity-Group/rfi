General Comment
"AI" is overhyped and doesn't solve actual problem s for the Am erican people. Com panies are already struggling to m ake m oney on it and
I believe it will fade away once it proves unprofitable. 
Artists, writers, and other creators and copyright holders m ust retain all rights and not have their work used to train Ai without
com pensation.
