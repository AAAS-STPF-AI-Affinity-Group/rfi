General Comment
The United States is not losing the race for better AI due to a lack of support from  the Federal Governm ent, but rather from  the current
popular com panies chasing profits vs im provem ents to their system s and a lack of im m ediate benefit to the m asses. The Federal
Governm ent would be better served focusing it's attention on im proving technology for a renewable energy sources and upgrading the
supporting infrastructure that provides internet access to citizens.
