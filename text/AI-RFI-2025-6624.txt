General Comment
We need an option to force com panies to rem ove personal inform ation from  training docum ents. I recently com peted on a US gam e
show, and now there are at least 2 AI-created profiles of m e on private fan sites, with no 'author' to contact to request rem oval. The
inform ation they have collected, about m e and other contestants, could not possibly have com e from  publicly available sources, as som e
of it is behind paywalls and institutional logins. It is also at least partially wrong; hallucinated based on the little available inform ation there
is. This creates real professional and personal risks. At the m om ent I have no way of rem oving this inform ation from  whatever AI was
used to com e up with this inform ation.
