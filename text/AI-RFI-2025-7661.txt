General Comment
Having AI training on copyright m aterial is wrong. This would cause not only identities to be skewed but it would businesses for m any
Am ericans. Many sm all businesses could lose potential because a m achine prom pt went in and stole their identity to a shady business. This
sam e practice can also ruin a m ajor business. Major businesses rely on artists and need to realize not everything can be m ade by a
m achine. You need artists to help design and write for them . AI shouldn't be replacing those who help create businesses.
