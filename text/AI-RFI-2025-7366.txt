General Comment
AI trained on data it does not own or have perm ission to use is theft, plain and sim ple. It is a parasite - it creates nothing new, gives
incorrect answers 60% of the tim e, and is horrible for the environm ent.
AI as we currently know it is not true artificial intelligence. It is a series of scraping algorithm s, which plagiarize and steal and produce
som ething less than the sum  of its parts.
AI doesn't have em otions, or critical thinking skills, or context. It can be easily led to extrem es and lead others to extrem es. There is no
im agination, no creativity, and no actual effort involved in using it. Everything it produces is purely derivative. AI is incapable of innovation.
AI needs to be clearly labeled as such and regulated heavily, and in som e areas - including art, m edia, literature, etc - it needs to be
banned outright.
The US governm ent should not be spending m oney and resources developing AI, and it should absolutely be lim iting AI's use in the
private sector. AI is a dangerous waste of our country's m oney.
