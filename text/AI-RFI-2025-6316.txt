General Comment
Stop this. Enough theft. There is NO reason to steal people's hard work and legitim ate creativity to m ake m indless, soulless slop. Just pay
som e artists who need the m oney, stop cutting corners and being cheap. This will ruin generations and there will be nothing creative or
original anym ore. Students will no longer be able to write their own papers, and these students will be the future's doctors, who will not
know a single thing because "AI" told them  what to write. The future will be ruined with AI. Stop this. ENOUGH
