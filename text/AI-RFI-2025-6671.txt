General Comment
I am  a writer and editor. My im agination is not only m y great joy, but often m y livelihood. 
Large language m odels steal m y work and the work of creative people like m e to create wealth for their owners. They could not exist
without the creative work of hum an beings. Their owners do not wish to pay those hum an beings for their efforts. 
Creators should have the legal right to opt out of having their work included in LLM training; to be fairly com pensated on an ongoing basis
for the use of their work if they opt in; and to easily pursue legal action against any com pany that steals their work. 
I create and write to share with other hum an beings. I do not want the products of that painstaking work used as fodder for som eone
elseâ€™s m achine without a choice in the m atter, or an ongoing piece of the profits if I so choose. Anything less than this m eans the
governm ent is sanctioning theft on behalf of a wealthy few.
