General Comment
AI should not use our personal inform ationm  nor should it use copyright inform ation that would infringe on the rights or creativity or hum an
creators. It should only be able to access item s in the public dom ain if that.
I am  frankly very concerned about the proliferation of AI before it is fully tested and I am  concernd about the energy and natural
resources needed in order to run AI. 
AI seem s to be som ething no-one asked for, and is being pushed upon the public so that tech com panies can m ake m oney. 
I think they should take the tim e to develop it in testing and not on the public, and once there is a true use for it, and the resources needed
to deliver it has been vetted, then it should be released.
I am  also concered that the tech com panies that are releasing AI products are using public energy and resources to profit. The tech
com panies should foot the bill for the energy and water at a higher rate than citizens, as we do not want to draw resources away from
everyday citizens to fuel the data centers needed to run AI.
