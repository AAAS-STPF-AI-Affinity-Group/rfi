General Comment
As an Am erican artist who has been already dealing with the scalping and salvaging of artwork for the “sake” of AI, I find m yself strongly
opposed to this. I’ve witnessed AI profiting off other artists without their knowledge and com pensation, harm ing Am erican businesses that
put their focus in art related industries just to start. AI, unrestricted and unregulated is dangerous and overhyped - and needs further
regulations and consideration before pushing the lim its can even be considered. As AI and this plan stands, I don’t see it having a future in
the US and I am  strongly against it.
