General Comment
Open AI unjustly profits off of the skill and labor of others without any sort of repaym ent for those individuals. this goes against everything
that our forefathers would have wanted, not to m ention tram pling all over worker's rights. 
Copyright infringem ent is theft. Period. And Open AI seeks to train its m odels off of the work of creators who self prom ote via online
platform s as a way of supporting them selves, thus stealing the jobs of others and rem oving their ability to live free, independent lives. 
Creative work is work, and deserves to be com pensated adequately, and Open AI does not do this. This will only harm  the am erican
people by instilling a sense of com placency and discouraging personal developm ent of creative skills which are ultim ately beneficial to
CREATING the country's future. 
Do not let this bill pass.
