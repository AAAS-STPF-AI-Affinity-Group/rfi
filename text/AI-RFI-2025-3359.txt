General Comment
I do not support using AI since the data it is trained upon is stolen from  hard working hum an beings. Som e of whom  rely on creating art
for a living.
It does not create new or even derivative works based on the data, it garbles up the original and spits out subpar content. It is a waste of
com putational energy and a waste of m oney.
This is nothing m ore than grasping by AI com panies in an attem pt to rem ove copyright protections so they can steal wholesale with no
repercussions. If they are allowed to do so, piracy m ay as well be m ade com pletely legal.
