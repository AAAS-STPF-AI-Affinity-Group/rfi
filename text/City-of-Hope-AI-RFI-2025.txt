RE: Request  for Information  on the Development  of an Artificial  Intelligence  Action  Plan 
Dear Dr. Parker,  
We appreciate  the opportunity  to provide  input  on the federal  government’s  approach  to artificial 
intelligence (AI) policy. We commend the administration’s commitment to ensuring American 
leadership in AI development, fostering innovation, and advancing the potential of AI -driven 
breakthroughs across industries, including healthcare.  
City of Hope (COH) is one of America’s largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment 
organizations and is also a leading research center for diabetes and other life -threatening illnesses. 
Founded in 1913, City of Hope has an independent, National Cancer Institute -designated 
comprehensive cancer center that is ranked in the top 5 in the nation for cancer care by U.S. News & 
World Report . Our growing national system includes the Los Angeles campus with extensive facilities 
for patient care, research, and academic training; a network of clinical care locations of clinical care 
locations across Southern California; a new cancer center in Orange County, California; and cancer 
treatment centers and outpatient facilities in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Phoenix areas. The Arizona - 
based Translational Genomics Research Institute, a world -renowned genomics research institute, is 
also part of the COH organization.  
COH’s mission is to make hope a reality for all touched by cancer and diabetes. More than 86 million 
people now live in communities with local access to a COH location. Last year, our organization  
treated close to 160,000 patients. As a leading independent biomedical research institution and  
cancer treatment center, COH is dedicated to leveraging cutting -edge technologies to improve cancer 
care and expand access to lifesaving treatments.  
COH’s innovative use of artificial intelligence is transforming patient care and research. Since 2017,  
we have been developing, deploying, and optimizing life -saving AI -driven predictive models that are 
actively integrated into clinical workflows. These models help identify critical risks —such as sepsis in 
vulnerable populations and complications in surgical procedures —enabling timely interventions that 
enhance clinical  outcomes and  improve quality  of life. Our pioneering AI initiatives extend  to oncology 
drug discovery, early cancer detection and prevention, advanced diagnostics, and deeper insights into 
cancer evolution and disease progression. Additionally, our oncology -specific large language model

platform, powered by COH’s unique data assets and world -class subject matter expertise, is 
streamlining administrative tasks and empowering clinicians with accurate, actionable, real -time 
data. These innovations provide clinicians with unique AI -driven insights that enhance decision - 
making  in diagnosis  and treatment,  ultimately improving  the patient  experience  and quality  of life. In 
doing  so, COH remains  at the forefront  of technological  innovation,  ensuring  that  hope  is delivered  to 
every patient and community we serve.  
AI is poised to transform oncology and healthcare, enabling more efficient research, earlier cancer 
detection, personalized treatment plans, and enhanced patient outcomes. To maximize AI’s benefits 
while mitigating risks, it is essential that federal policies provide clear, practical guidelines that 
support innovation through ethical AI deployment while protecting patient safety, and data privacy.  
COH recognizes and supports the administration’s focus on removing barriers to AI development and 
ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of global AI leadership. Targeted, thoughtful 
regulatory approaches —rather than unnecessary constraints —will be the key to unlocking AI’s full 
potential in healthcare. As policymakers consider the future of AI governance, COH welcomes the 
opportunity  to collaborate  in shaping  policies  that  bolster  American  innovation,  protect  patient  safety, 
and enable AI -driven advancements in medicine.  
City of Hope’s  Internal  Governance  for AI 
As an organization  that  both  develops  and uses  AI tools  in a highly  regulated  industry  (healthcare)  and 
a highly regulated  state (California), COH strives to  ensure that any  AI tools we  deploy  have the seven 
characteristics of trustworthy AI systems as identified in the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology’s (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework: (1) Valid and Reliable; (2) Safe; (3) Secure and 
Resilient; (4) Accountable and Transparent; (5) Explainable and Interpretable; (6) Privacy -Enhanced; 
and (7) Fair with Harmful Bias Managed.  
We believe it  is important  for future federal policy to adhere to these principles and, to this end, we 
have  built  our own AI  governance  structure  on the  NIST  principles. To  ensure  AI and Machine  Learning 
(ML) is applied  responsibly  and ethically across our  organization, we are working  diligently  to establish
organizational policy that sets forth clear guidelines and best practices for team members engaged in
development  of AI/ML tools,  in addition  to those  using  AI/ML  in their  day-to-day work.
Our internal AI governance policy emphasizes the need to disclose current AI tools and submit future 
use cases for review. The policy identifies potential risks associated with AI/ML and generative AI, 
which include inaccuracies, biases, and intellectual property concerns. Employees are instructed to 
verify  AI outputs,  engage  leadership  for new  AI adoptions,  and avoid  inputting  personal  or confidential 
information into public AI tools. The policy stresses compliance, outlining specific "do's" and "don'ts" 
to maintain safety, effectiveness, and ethical integrity. Ultimately, City of Hope aims to harness 
AI/ML's power while safeguarding patient care and privacy, research, and organizational standards.  
AI Model  Development  and Governance  
As federal agencies consider approaches to AI governance, it is important to recognize that AI 
applications present varying levels of risk depending on their context. Governance at both the federal 
and state levels would be  best  served  by a risk -based  approach  tailored  to how AI  models are applied. 
While COH does not take a position on regulating foundation models, we offer insight from our 
experience deploying AI in clinical settings.  


Docusign  Envelope  ID: E3DDD193 -0B8E -4750 -AE8F -3C24441E6407  Page 3 
At COH, our work in predictive modeling for clinical decision support —such as post -bone marrow 
transplant risk -assessment and surgical complication prediction —has shown that achieving high  
initial accuracy is only the first step in responsible AI implementation. To ensure patient safety and 
model reliability, AI systems must undergo rigorous validation across diverse patient populations and 
clinical settings before deployment.  
Federal policy should encourage frameworks that emphasize real -world testing, subgroup analyses, 
and continuous monitoring to detect drift and evolving clinical risks. This approach would help 
safeguard patient safety while fostering an environment that supports responsible medical 
innovation.  
City of Hope’s  Internal  Governance  for AI 
As an organization  that  both  develops  and uses  AI tools  in a highly  regulated  industry  (healthcare)  and 
a highly regulated  state (California), COH strives to  ensure that any  AI tools we  deploy  have the seven 
characteristics of trustworthy AI systems as identified in the National Institute of Standards and

to maintain safety, effectiveness, and ethical integrity. Ultimately, City of Hope aims to harness 
AI/ML's power while safeguarding patient care and privacy, research, and organizational standards.  
Explainability  and Assurance  of AI Model  Outputs  
In healthcare, explainability is not just a technical nicety —it is fundamental to clinical decision - 
making. COH understands that when AI outputs are transparent and interpretable, clinicians can trust 
and effectively act on these insights to improve patient outcomes. For example, COH’s predictive 
models provide risk scores along with contextual explanations that clarify the factors driving the 
prediction.  
That said, explainable AI is a challenging and evolving field, without a clear resolution at this time. 
COH believes that policy should strike a balance between promoting robust standards for 
interpretability while retaining sufficient flexibility to accommodate emerging technologies. For 
instance, in contexts where full explainability may be unattainable —such as with large language 
model outputs —alternative assurance measures like providing supporting references, confidence 
scores, and verification tools should be encouraged.  
Ultimately,  the goal  is to  ensure  that  AI systems  are safe,  reliable,  and trusted,  while  continuing  to 
advance progress and innovation in the healthcare field.

Application  and Use (Private  Sector  or Government)  
At COH, we believe that responsible and well -integrated AI applications can significantly improve 
research, patient care, and operational efficiency. Policies should encourage partnerships between 
public institutions and private enterprises to  scale these innovations, providing clear  frameworks for 
deployment, risk management, and continuous monitoring, while remaining adaptive enough to 
support innovative approaches.  
By fostering collaboration and focusing governance on the application and use of AI, policymakers  
can help ensure that AI tools are safely, responsibly, and effectively implemented to enable research, 
enhance patient outcomes, streamline operations, and ultimately drive meaningful progress in 
healthcare.  
Research  and Development  
At COH, our pursuit  of innovative AI research —from oncology -specific large language models to  multi - 
modal systems for understanding cancer evolution and disease progression —illustrates the 
transformative power of robust AI research and development. Policies should prioritize and support 
interdisciplinary research and experimentation. We believe that breakthroughs in precision medicine 
and early disease detection and prevention can be achieved through funding initiatives, collaborative 
frameworks, and public –private partnerships that foster rapid prototyping and real -world testing.  
Importantly, regulatory measures must be designed to empower researchers without stifling 
innovation. Such an approach can accelerate the translation of cutting -edge research into practical, 
life-saving  applications.  
By bridging the gap between research and clinical application, appropriate AI policies can ensure that 
advances in AI are quickly and safely integrated into healthcare delivery, ultimately driving significant 
improvements in patient outcomes and operational efficiency.  
Conclusion  
COH remains committed to harnessing artificial intelligence to enhance patient care, advance 
research, and improve healthcare efficiency, while upholding the highest ethical and regulatory 
standards. AI holds tremendous potential to drive breakthroughs in precision medicine, early disease 
detection, and operational efficiency, but  realizing  this potential requires thoughtful governance that 
balances innovation, safety, and trust.  
A risk -based, application -focused approach to AI policy will be essential to ensuring that AI -driven 
advancements in healthcare remain safe, transparent, and effective. Explainability, validation, and 
continuous  monitoring  must  be prioritized,  while  policies  should  remain  adaptive  enough  to support 
emerging technologies and interdisciplinary research. Encouraging public –private partnerships and 
funding initiatives will help accelerate the responsible deployment of AI in clinical settings.  
COH welcomes continued engagement with federal policymakers to help shape AI governance in a 
way that fosters innovation while safeguarding patient well -being. By prioritizing transparency, 
rigorous oversight, and collaboration, policymakers can help ensure that AI remains a trusted and 
transformative tool in healthcare, improving outcomes for patients and communities alike.
