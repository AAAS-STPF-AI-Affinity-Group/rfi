General Comment
I do not believe the current scope of AI technology has any positive effect on this country's future. Currently, it serves to not only steal
jobs from  Am ericans, but com pletely displace certain job titles which disproportionately affect "low skilled" workers. It is being used to
learn from  the hard work of real people with no credit to them  at all, while creating profit for the people who create AI learning m odels.
Late-stage capitalism  m eans that m ost of AI technology is being produced solely because it can earn som eone m oney, m eanwhile the
sam e tech is being im plem ented to suppress not only our own residents on our own soil, but also in m ilitary advancem ents that will rem ove
the "hum an touch" from  killing innocent people.
