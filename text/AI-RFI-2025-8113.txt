General Comment
You're essentially supporting the notion of taking away jobs, creative m inds and future prospects. You com plain about people, but do not
com plain of an AI taking it over and essentially screwing you and/or future generations of your own and others around you.
Are you alright in the head or has the need to jum p on the train or wealth at unnatural levels disconnected you from  reality so that your
skeletal rem ains be covered in gold when you're gone, leaving all that dam age your blood or others have to clean up????
