AI in its current form, the one that takes existing works and rearranges them for no discernable
purpose, should NOT be allowed to steal from the original work of artist without their consentand without legal recourse. I make original music and have for most of my life. Thistechnology confers no benefit to humanity, it doesn't even benefit businesses in the long run.It's just another buzzword that corporations who don't care about people slap onto everythingto make it seem more attractive. I am 100% against this and frankly, it's insane that this iseven on the table. The US is the butt of the joke, the rest of the world is laughing at us. It'spathetic.
