Re: UltraPass Response to White House AI Action Plan  
OVERVIEW:  
Beyond hardware and chips, data is the single most critical input to AI 
development. Data is the preeminent strategic asset in the AI era. As AI and 
large language models (LLMs) become a foundational technology for 
economic and national security, digital identity will be a key determinant of AI 
dominance. Those with access to the most valuable data will determine AI 
superiority, and digital identity technologies are emerging as a central 
infrastructure for global data flows. Digital identity technologies ar e the gateway 
to citizens’ most sensitive data, and who controls them will shape the future of 
AI, governance, and global power. These systems will sit at the core of trillions of 
transactions, influencing economies, societies, and even individual thought.  
With billions already in use, digital identity solutions are being deployed globally 
at an accelerating pace, with applications spanning every industry - from 
healthcare and education to energy and global trade - securing high -value 
data exchanges. These systems are rapidly becoming prime targets for 
adversary nations, seeking to infiltrate and amass unprecedented volumes of 
data at an unimaginable scale.  
Companies - and countries - that embed themselves in the digital identity 
infrastructure will have the ability to siphon vast amounts of sensitive data, 
fueling AI models that could shape the world in ways counter to U.S. interests. If 
the U.S. wants to ma intain leadership in emerging technologies and AI, we 
cannot afford to let that happen. Ensuring the integrity of digital identity systems 
is not just a matter of cybersecurity - it is a national security imperative that will 
dictate who drives the interna tional world order.   
China recognizes this reality and is rapidly embedding itself into digital identity 
infrastructure worldwide, leveraging its Digital Silk Road to gain privileged access 
to vast troves of transactional, biometric, and behavioral data. If adversarial 
actors dominate digital identity systems, they won’t just own today’s data —they

will train tomorrow’s AI models, embedding authoritarian values into global 
world order. The U.S. cannot afford another 5G / Huawei moment. Just as 
control over 5G networks and associated tech stacks dictated access to global 
communications, control over d igital identity will determine who shapes next -
generation AI governance systems.   
Without a concerted effort to support U.S. digital identity solutions and interests 
abroad, the U.S. risks ceding global influence to China’s AI -driven governance 
model, allowing Beijing to shape how identity, data, and digital ecosystems 
function across k ey regions like Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  
Without U.S. alternatives, China will set the global standards for identity 
verification, digital trust, and AI -powered governance, undermining U.S. 
leadership and compromising the integrity of cri tical systems. The U.S. must act 
decisively to safeguard digital identity infrastructure, secure AI training data, 
and prevent adversarial control over the digital economy. This must be a core 
pillar of the U.S. AI Action Plan, ensuring that democratic val ues, privacy 
protections, and American technological leadership define the future of AI —not 
authoritarian surveillance models.  
It is critical to counter China’s influence in digital identity infrastructure and 
promote a U.S. -led digital identity ecosystem that ensures economic security, 
national security, and global digital trust. The U.S. cannot lose its eye on the 
competition un folding in the region and counter China’s dominance in digital ID 
infrastructure, biometric databases, and identity verification technologies. The 
U.S. - along with like -minded nations in the Indo -Pacific - need to prevent 
reliance on Chinese / Chinese -influenced firms for digital ID infrastructure, 
hardware, and AI -driven verification to blunt Chinese efforts to control global ID 
systems, particularly in developing nations.   
RECOMMENDATIONS:  
To secure digital identity as a foundation for AI leadership, I recommend the 
following actions for consideration to strengthen national security, counter 
Chinese influence, and expand U.S. digital identity innovation to lead the global 
market to ensure se cure digital ecosystems, and enable U .S. leadership in AI.   
• White House / National Security Council:   
o Include digital ID resilience as a key area of collaboration with allies 
and partners in the Indo -Pacific in the national strategies.  
o Position the U.S. as the dominant provider of secure, privacy -
preserving digital ID solutions.

•Intelligence Community:
oConduct annual assessments on China’s influence in global digital
ID markets and implications for U.S. national security, as well as
potential Chinese cyber threats targeting digital ID databases.
oEstablish information sharing mechanisms with like -minded countries
on vulnerabilities and concerns on the use of Chinese apps and
platforms for Digital ID verification.
•Department of Commerce:
oIncentivize U.S. firms to export digital ID technology to emerging
markets.
oEntity List Expansion: Restrict Chinese companies (e.g., Huawei, ZTE,
CloudWalk, Megvii, Hikvision) from supplying AI, biometrics, or digital
ID infrastructure to U.S. or allied nations.
oDigital Identity Export Strategy: Support U.S. companies in scaling
trusted Digital ID solutions globally.
•Department of State:
oDigital Infrastructure Diplomacy: educate and expand awareness
to like -minded nations in procuring and deploying U.S. alternatives
to Chinese solutions.
oPrioritize and support regional digital ID infrastructure in the Indo -
Pacific to prevent adoption of China’s Digital Silk Road solutions.
oEstablish financing for non -Chinese digital ID solutions in developing
nations in the Indo -Pacific at risk of adopting Beijing’s digital idenity
solutions.
•Congress / Legislative Actions
oCongressional Funding for Secure Digital ID Innovation: $500M+ in
competitive grants for U.S. firms working on privacy -first Digital ID
technologies.
oHearings on China Digital Silk Road and implications for AI
leadership.
CONCLUSION: THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE  


4 | Pa g e
The future of AI leadership, economic security, and digital sovereignty will be 
shaped by who controls the foundational infrastructure of digital identity 
technologies. If the U.S. does not act decisively, it risks allowing China to 
dominate AI -driven iden tity verification, population -scale data collection, and 
the global digital economy. We cannot risk losing U.S. tech leadership in a 
critical 21st -century domain.  
The recommendations above ensure digital ID development aligns with U.S. 
national security, economic leadership, and democratic values —while blocking 
China’s ability to dominate this space. Promoting opportunities for U.S. 
companies and technologies overse as is key for global leadership and market 
share, enhancing the strength of the U.S. economy, as well as ensuring that the 
future of AI and technology, economic security, and national security align with 
the U.S. values.   
The time to act is now. The U.S. must ensure that the technology underpinning 
digital identity —one of the most critical enablers of AI, the digital ecosystems, 
and international economies —is built on a foundation of security, trust, and 
American leadership  - both at home and in one of the most consequential 
regions in the world - the Indo -Pacific.
