General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft of
artists, writers, and creative individuals all over the world. AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. I believe that
supporting AI is supporting piracy and theft, and we should m ake sure there are guardrails against it being used inappropriately.
