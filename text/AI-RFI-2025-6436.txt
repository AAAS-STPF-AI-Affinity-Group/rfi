General Comment
As an artist, m e and m y com m unity do not approve of m achine learning (falsely advertise as AI) tools being used as a way to launder
copyright protected artwork, that was taken and used to train these m achines both without original authors' consent nor without a care for
the fact that this essentially counts as stealing, in order to create an appearance of originally generated content that then they them selves
can profit from . People running "AI" m odels should not be given any m ore freedom  than they already have to scrape data from  the internet
and use it as they please without any tangible hindrance. Not only this is creating a m ajor ethical problem , the so called AI tools are not
effective to begin with and they consum e way m ore financial resource, electricity and storage space than they ever produce anything
resem bling a passable result, even as tool that essentially regurgitates stolen data and recom bines into som ething seem ingly new.
Generative AI does not benefit anyone else, but the con artists, who use to for quick easy m oney, scam  and im personation, all while not
caring for the dam age to both the parties they scam , not the parties that has to m aintain all that ineffective infrastructure for the scam  to
even work.
I do not wish to see a world, where con m en are given perm ission to create tools, that they falsely advertise as not what they actually are,
that m ake their scam s even easier for them , while the burden of expense falls onto literally everyone but the bad actors. Do not give
freedom  to AI m odel developers to just take whatever data that they thought they had right to take, as m any of said data is a property or
work of actual real people that is being abused, altered and profited from . If they need data to train their tools, then either they have to
create their own or be required to secure the right to use other's, no m atter what cause they advertise.
