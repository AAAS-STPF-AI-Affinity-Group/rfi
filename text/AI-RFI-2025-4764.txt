General Comment
This is terrible. If anyone steals from  artists or uses their IP without perm ission, we'd call that an infringem ent. If IP laws can't even protect
artist from  that, what are we doing. Legally letting AI com panies steal art is abhorrent. There has been little m aterial benefit shown from
using generative AI to m ake sounds and im ages for use in artistic endeavors. It would be bad on the those grounds alone, but the
environm ental im pact is also staggering. We can't let som eone else profit on another's labor just because they had a com puter look at the
im age first. Please respect artists.
