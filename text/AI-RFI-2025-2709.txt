General Comment
AI does not have any benefit to the Am erican people whatsoever and will only cause undue harm  to m illions upon m illions of Am ericans.
The wanton spread of AI is dam aging any and all creative industries in the country, and left unchecked, it will com pletely destroy them  and
the lives of the creators involved. Copyright law exists for a reason and absolutely m ust be enforced. The reckless and m alicious theft
exhibited by AI com panies and m odels m ust be reined in and their creators punished. Weakening the protections that Am erican creators
have in place (that need to be enforced) will not only ruin lives and the creative force that Am erican artists are in the world, it would also
enable foreign entities to easily steal from  them  as well. This plan to weaken the protections Am erican creators have won't even serve the
purpose of securing Am erican dom inance, as foreign entities would be able to use the wealth of Am erican creative work to likewise fuel
their own AI system s and com pletely outpace us. No m atter how you spin it, the Am erican people will lose everything if this m oves
forward in any fashion.
