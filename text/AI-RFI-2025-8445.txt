General Comment
Oh, f&^% off. AI dominance my a&^, these f&^% techbros have invented new and interesti ng forms of plagiarism and now 
they're trying to make it legal. 
There is no conceivable usage for this tech that isn't horribly unethical or just plain something that half a dozen reaso nably well-paid 
artists/coder s could do better . But knowing the corporat ions investing in this, they would rather sink millions into a computer than pay a 
human being a livable wage.
