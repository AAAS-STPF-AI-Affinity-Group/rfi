General Comment
As an artist, I do not support the use of AI in the USA’s future. Ai uses theft of other people’s property to m ake its content and that’s not
okay. OpenAI or any sim ilar groups have no right to take away Am erican’s livelihoods and profits just to feed into their system  to m isuse
and abuse. Ai is generally not as popular as y’all are m aking it out to be.
