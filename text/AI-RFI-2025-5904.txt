General Comment
AI does not holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  people, including from  Am ericans and profits off of theft. AI is overhyped
and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. Do not give AI and AI com panies m ore power. Stop AI now and m ake laws to protect
creators from  having their work stolen.
