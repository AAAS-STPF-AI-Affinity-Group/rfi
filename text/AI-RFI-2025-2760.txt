General Comment
AI does not have any value for the future of Am erica and I am  firm ly opposed to em powering those who would use it at the expense of
their fellow citizen's jobs, opportunities, and with no regard for its ethical developm ent. AI built off of stolen works, a lack of consent, or
opt-out based system s m ust be rooted out and stopped.
