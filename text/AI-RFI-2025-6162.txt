Re: National Science Foundationâ€™s Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
I am  a Freelance artist that one day hopes to contribute to the m illion dollar industry that is Anim ation/entertainm ent. Even though "AI" and
Language m odel technology is prom ising for fields Like science and technology, And will likely birth jobs to develop and m oderate these
advancem ents. It poses a real threat to creative works and careers. Could term inate thousands of job and render that entire industry and
discipline null. Affecting Am erican exports of entertainm ent all over the world.
I really hope Big tech doesn't win on this.
