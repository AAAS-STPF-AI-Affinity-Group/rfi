General Comment
Generative AI is the scourge of intellectual property and hum an creativity. It is a m assive drain on the world’s resources, poisons the
inform ation ecosystem  of search engines with false, fraudulent, m isleading and outright dangerous disinform ation, and still requires hum an
intervention to correct outright hallucinated lies, artifacts and extraneous fingers and lim bs. Copyright helps protect creators who
contribute to our econom ic growth and provide us with hum an stories and entertainm ent. If we allow AI to be trained on copyrighted
works, then copyright will becom e pointless and m oot, and m ight as well not exist at all, which is anathem a to the entire concept of
intellectual property and artistic expression. It devalues art, it steals the livelihoods and jobs from  artists, m usicians, film m akers, author,
every artisan who has ever created anything. Generative AI’s m ain practical application is to create fraudulent products and enable scam s.
