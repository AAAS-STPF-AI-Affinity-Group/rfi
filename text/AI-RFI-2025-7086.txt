General Comment
Generative AI is theft, plain and sim ple. It has been used again and again to underm ine and steal from  artists, and cannot be considered
"fair use" in any way. It has been used to steal from  m y livelihood, and it is un-Am erican. AI holds no place in the United States.
Corporations should not be exem pt from  the law in the richest country in the world.
