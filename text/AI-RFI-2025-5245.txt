General Comment
Beyond the obvious problem  of letting AI and it’s associated com pany have free reign on anyone’s work without perm ission or
com pensation, this would open the flood gates for any tech com pany, no m atter how little they have to do with AI, to claim  they should be
able steal everyone’s intellectual property with zero consequence. How long do we have until these wannabe thieves start saying, “If a
soulless AI program  can legally take others hard work for itself, surely a hum an should be legally allowed to do the sam e?”
