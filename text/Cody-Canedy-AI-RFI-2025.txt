As an artist whose work is stolen in the algorithm of generative ai, and as a former teacher, 
believe that ai should not hold any place in the united states. At best, it is just an overhyped 
bubble waiting to be popped, but at its worst, AI steals from my livelihood as an American, 
profits off of theft, and encourages laziness. Many students squander their education, choosing 
to make chat gpt do their work for them. In the way that it is currently being used and 
developed, it does more harm than good to the intelligence of the American people. Please, for 
the good of America and its people, do not allow AI to continue in its current form unregulated.
