General Comment
It seem s utterly ridiculous to even have to argue against this. Am erica doesn't need, want, nor should it be wasting tim e and resources
getting a share in the "Generative AI Market". There is no m ore an econom ic incentive to buy into AI, then there was to buy into Beanie
Babies or Tulips. The idea m y *governm ent* would fall for such a scam  m arketing tactic is unacceptable.
On top of that, why would you think I want an AI allowing people to copy m y style and art if wouldn't want other people using m y
copyrighted works for their own gain regardless. This m akes m e and all m y collaborators less likely to do business in the US and I will
m ake sure to inform  every com m unity I work in that the US is no longer safe to publish works in.
