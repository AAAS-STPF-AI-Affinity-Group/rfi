My name is Lexi Mannion, and I am a graduating senior from Avonworth High School. My 
academic focus has included an in- depth study of Generative AI and its societal 
implications. In particular, I dedicated two months to researching the application of AI 
within early childhood education for my AI and Ethics course. My ﬁndi ngs suggest that the 
current administration's approach to AI regulation strikes a necessary balance between fostering innovation and ensuring responsible implementation. I believe that AI holds signiﬁcant potential to enhance educational outcomes. In speciﬁc scenarios, it can provide valuable support to educators while simultaneously cultivating essential digital literacy, creativity, and problem -solving skills in children. As Adriene Shannon articulates in 
her work on AI in ECE, "If Aidan recognizes that  Tommy is struggling with math, but excelling 
in language, Aidan can prompt math and language activities at different paces." This demonstrates AI's capacity to leverage data analysis for personalized learning, catering to individual learning styles, paces, and interests. While the integration of AI is inevitable, U.S. legislation must evolve to keep pace with rapid technological advancements. The Kids 
Online Safety Act, initially proposed in 2021, aims to protect minors' data on social media 
platforms. However, it does not address the data collection practices of web service providers and educational institutions. If schools decide to integrate AI into the curriculum, ongoing dialogue should bring families together with schools so everyone can help children beneﬁt from AI while minimizing its potential harm. While AI offers substantial beneﬁts in 
education, innovation and regulation need to be balanced. In essence, AI offers 
tremendous potential to enhance educational experiences, but we must approach its integration with a thoughtful and balanced perspective, ensuring that innovation is guided by responsible regulation and ethical considerations.
