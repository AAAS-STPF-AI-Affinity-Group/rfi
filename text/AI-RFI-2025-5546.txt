General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US, or the world at large, for that m atter. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an
Am erican and profits off of theft of artworks and m aterials from  num erous people. AI is m assively overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of
the Am erican public. Its potential for creating falsified, lifelike videos and im ages are im m ensely dangerous, and could lead to wrongful
arrests or far worse. It has already been abused to m ake false pornographic content of public figures, which is then shared widely on the
internet. Sim ply put, cham pioning generative AI is wrong. If you rally behind this dangerous, awful tech, then you're either a m oron, evil, or
both, and the consequences that will follow will be im m ense.
