Re: National Science Foundationâ€™s Request for Inform ation on the Developm ent of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
This is theft, plain and sim ple. All of those copy written works uploaded on the internet or put into the world were not done so with the
intention to have them  stolen, and profited from  by those thieves. Millions of creators did not consent to have their works taken by this AI
phenom enon and it's unfair to give them  no say in the m atter whether their work is to be used or not to train som ething that didn't exist a
few years ago; som ething that they now fear will steal from  them .
These big tech com panies are using fear m ongering to bend you to their will, with prom ises that this is som ehow necessary when it
absolutely is not. 
Please do not allow this. It's an absolutely vile infiltration of our rights as Am ericans, our property, and our creations. It will create the
exact opposite of any kind of hum an flourishing, or feeling any sort of security within our own country. Thank you.
