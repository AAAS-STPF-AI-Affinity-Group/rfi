General Comment
Please do not allow for unethical training of AI. Many m ethods of gathering the vast am ount of required training data are deceptive,
unethical, or a straight infringem ent of personal privacy and hum an rights, often ignoring intellectual property or copyright laws. To prevent
this, I believe it is param ount that we prioritize transparency on AI training data and protections for people's personal data.
I also believe that replacem ent of hum an workers with AI poses a grave threat to lower and m iddle class people, as well as being
extrem ely dangerous as com panies opt to use subpar AI that has not been properly tested for safety and accuracy in order to save
m oney.
