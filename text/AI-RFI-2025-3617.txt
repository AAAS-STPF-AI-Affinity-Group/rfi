General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. OpenAI cannot provide Am erica with any useful service that its own people
cannot currently provide. It steals from  artists, novel writers, photographers, playwrights, screenwriters, graphic designers, and every
other Am erican creative under the sun and directly profits off the theft of their work. Copyright infringem ent laws were written into being
FOR A REASON and exist to protect the work belonging to com panies and individuals along with their ability to profit and m ake m oney
from  their own work without worrying about som eone stealing it and using it under their own nam e. AI is grossly overhyped and
CANNOT PERFORM THE SERVICE ADVERTISED. AI does not do research or paint pictures or answer questions. It is a string of
code program m ed to com b the Internet and sim ply generate som ething it thinks fulfills the criteria without bothering to check its sources or
ask for perm ission. You can ask AI for a banana bread recipe and it will return you what it thinks is a banana bread recipe, but will be a
recipe for a loaf of bread shaped like a banana, or worse, som ething that isn't a recipe at all. The idea that OpenAI and other generative
AI com panies require a pass to circum vent copyright infringem ent, a policy that this country takes very seriously, is a huge joke and
should be extrem ely telling that AI is a waste of tim e and nothing m ore than a com m on thief.
