STRUCTURED APPROACHES FOR FAIR AND ETHICAL A.I. APPLICATIONS
BLOCKCHAIN & DISTRIBUTED LEDGER SOLUTIONS FOR  COPYRIGHTED ART WORKS
The rise of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) text-to-image Art generators has 
caught the attention of the world through the proliferation of applications like Midjourney,
Dall-E2, and Stable Diffusion. Applications which while compelling, are fundamentally powered 
by Copyrighted material for which no licensing agreement exists, no credit to the creator is 
attributed, and no compensation has been negotiated.
It isn't hyperbole  when critics describe  the utilization of the Laion-5B  database,  an ‘educational  
database’  of 5 billion  images  ‘scraped’  from the internet, and later converted into a for-profit 
resource, as the biggest art heist in the history of the world.
Prevailing  apologist  arguments  for the rapid  unlawful  dispossession  of entire castes of creative  
classes via A.I.  Generative  Art applications,  are typified by stale talking points accentuated  with 
idioms  like ‘ The horse has left the barn’, ‘The toothpaste is out of the tube.’ and ’the genie is out 
of the bottle’, failing to realize,  that someone  skilled,  built the barn, tamed the horse, tubed the 
toothpaste, cast the bottle, and ultimately, placed  the Genie inside of it, and the bottle within a 
password  protected vault no less.
Technology  is the best hope  for a hedge  against  a seemingly  uncontainable  entity, whether  that 
be a raging  fire, an invasive  species, or a hyper-accelerated  technological  software 
development.  21st century software quandaries  are best solved by 21st century software 
remedies  as the latter is alike in conception  to the former  as a consequence  of the similar 
processes  which bore them.
AI/ML models  are an elegant  lever, able to foist an extremely large  amount of data, utilizable  in 
a meaningful  way for quantitative  pursuits like  logistics management, financial  models, and 
medical  diagnosis,  but fall dramatically  short,  when  consideration  is given  to qualitative  outputs, 
as their value is completely dependent  on the source material inputs and totally derivative in 
nature and scope. Over  dependence  on such tools becomes an increasingly  self-referential  and 
recursive  process, which not only portends the displacement  of countless  jobs in the 
Entertainment, Design,  and Visual Arts Industries, but if left wholly  unchecked,  could  erode the 
deep  cultural knowledge  of the visual arts and dramatically  affect the United  States pre imminent  
position  as the world's  leader  in Creative Cultural  Exports, within  the span of a single generation
The principal  conundrum,  is how to protect Intellectual  Property and Copyrighted  materials, safe 
guarding  developing  future artists and past works, without impeding  desirable  developments  in 
useful technological  applications  for Artificial Intelligence  and Machine  Learning.  Presently, 
Blockchain  Technology  is an option worth considering  in whole  or in part.


Primary Objectives
1.Prevent mass intellectual property theft.
2.Credit, Consent, and  Compensation (CCC) for copyright holders.
3.Create an auditable transparent database of copyrighted material.
Summary
The misapplication of Generative AI systems has led to mass intellectual property 
theft.  The entities  in question have used databases  created strictly for  
educational research to train for-profit Generative AI systems. These entities 
have been utilizing copyrighted material to profit without  adequately  or 
contractually compensating the  copyright holders.
Through distributed ledger technology, we can create a consensual transparent 
system that  will protect copyright holders and ensure legal utilization of 
Generative AI technology.
It is important to realize that  the most prominent proponents of Generative AI are 
large organizations  with sufficient resources to adapt to new legal regulations.  
Furthermore, existing laws surrounding  copyright infringement  and intellectual  
property theft  are already being violated at a planetary scale . Rectifying these 
violations will be a long and resource-intensive process, which is neither 
favorable for  the Generative AI Corporations nor the  Copyright Holders . What  is 
being proposed in the following documentation is a favorable arrangement that  
allows for the  existing Generative AI Corporations to continue developing  unique 
technology while remaining within  the bounds of the law  and contractual 
obligations to copyright holders.ANDREW MACLEAN
