I.Introduction and Summary
On behalf of the Multicultural Media, Telecom and Internet Council (MMTC), we appreciate the 
opportunity to provide input to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and 
Networking and Information Technology Research and Development ( NITRD) National 
Coordination Office regarding the development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan as directed by Presidential Executive Order 14179.

Since 1986, MMTC has served as a leading public interest technology organization fighting for equal access and representation in technology, media, and telecommunications through 
opportunity creation, awareness building, and advocacy.  As the leading voice for communities 
of color and other marginalized groups in the nation’ s most important industries, we bring nearly 
four decades of experience working at the intersection of technology, civil rights, and economic empowerment. 
MMTC believes that American leadership in AI requires harnessing our nation ’s full innovative 
potential.  Our recommendations focus on concrete policy actions that will strengthen America’ s

(Feb. 6, 2025).  


competitive edge in AI through multi -perspective development practices that expand markets, 
mitigate risks, and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens.  By ensuring AI works for all 
Americans, we can accelerate innovation while avoiding costly pitfalls and market failures that 
result from narrowly developed systems. 
Our recommendations for the AI Action Plan include: 
• Establishing structured public -private partnerships through AI Innovation Zones in 
multicultural communities and shared testing environments through NIST 
• Creating industry -led data trusts with community oversight to expand diverse training 
data while respecting privacy and sovereignty  
• Building talent pipelines through AI Centers of Excellence at HBCUs and MSIs, 
expanded apprenticeship programs, and K- 12 AI literacy initiatives  
• Developing balanced regulatory frameworks including industry- led standards with 
multicultural stakeholder participation, safe harbor provisions, and independent 
assessment methodologies 
• Implementing metrics for measuring AI system performance across diverse populations 
to drive market-based improvements without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens 
These practical, market -driven approaches will strengthen America's competitive edge in AI 
while ensuring these technologies benefit all communities. 
II. Economic and Innovation Benefits of Including 
Multicultural Communities  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing at a blistering pace, transforming industries, and 
redefining how we live and work.  As we shape America’s AI Action Plan, the economic and 
innovation benefits of multi -perspective development represent a compelling business case for 
ensuring multicultural communities are central to our national strategy.   Including multicultural 
communities present opportunities for (a) expand market opportunities and innovation, (b) 
enhanced talent development and competitiveness, and ( c) risk mitigation and regulatory 
efficiency.   
a. Expanded Market Opportunities and Innovation 
The business case for intentionally incorporating multicultural communities in AI development 
goes far beyond altruism – it directly impacts the bottom line.  When AI systems are developed 
with diverse perspectives, they unlock markets that might otherwise remain underserved or 
overlooked entirely.  As Sam Altman noted, “AI is a rare example of an extremely hyped thing 


that almost everyone still underestimates the impact of. ”2 But to fully realize this impact, our AI 
systems must work for everyone. 
History has repeatedly shown that diverse teams identify problems and solutions that 
homogeneous groups miss.3  This isn ’t abstract theory – it’s market reality.  When facial 
recognition systems initially failed to properly identify darker -skinned faces, it wasn ’t just a 
technical failure but a massive market limitation. Companies that addressed these issues unlocked additional customer segments worth billions.   
Multicultural perspectives drive innovation by challenging assumptions and bringing fresh 
viewpoints that lead to more robust products.  Looking at examples from the development of 
ChatGPT and other generative AI models, systems trained on more diverse datasets demonstrate 
measurably superior performance across varied user demographics.  This creates not just better 
individual products but entirely new market categories.  
b.Talent Development and Competitiveness
America faces a critical AI talent shortage that threatens our global leadership position.  As AI 
employment continues to grow exponentially, with research suggesting that roughly 60% of 
today’s workers are in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940,4 we cannot afford to tap only a 
fraction of our potential talent pool.  
Building educational and professional pipelines in multicultural communities creates a 
sustainable competitive advantage that directly addresses America’ s AI talent shortage.   When 
we invest in talent development across all communities, we uncover exceptional minds that would otherwise remain untapped.  Companies building AI systems cannot afford to overlook 
diverse talent pools if they hope to maintain market leadership.  The existing networks of 
historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), commun ity colleges, and grassroots 
technology training programs in multicultural communities provide ready -made infrastructure 
that can be leveraged to rapidly scale AI education.   Companies that establish early partnerships 
with these institutions gain preferential access to diverse talent pools, while multicultural communities gain pathways to high-growth careers.  This symbiotic relationship strengthens both

industry innovation and community economic development, creating a self -reinforcing cycle that 
enhances American competitiveness in the global AI race.  
International competition for AI leadership is intensifying daily.  Nations that leverage their full 
demographic diversity will outpace those that don ’t.  By investing in AI education across all 
communities, we ensure America maintains its leadership position not just for the next product 
cycle, but for generations to come.  
c.Risk Mitigation and Regulatory Efficiency
Universal involvement in AI development is not just good ethics – it ’s good business.  AI 
systems developed without diverse input inevitably meet  costly failures in the marketplace.  
These failures aren ’t merely theoretical – they represent real financial and reputational damage 
that companies must subsequently address at much greater expense.  
Documented algorithmic failures in real- world situations underscore the business costs of 
homogonous development practices.  When Nijeer Parks was wrongfully arrested after facial 
recognition software misidentified him as a suspect in a hotel shoplifting case – spending 10 days in jail before charges were dropped  – it wasn ’t just a civil rights failure.
5  It represented 
massive inefficiency and wasted resources in our justice system, with taxpayers bearing the cost 
of improper detention, court proceedings, and potential settlement payments.  These failures 
multiply across sectors: algorithms directing healthcare resources away from Black patients create economic inefficiencies through increased emergency care costs and lost productivity
6; 
mortgage7 and rental application systems8 that disadvantage minority applicants shrink potential 
markets and reduce economic activity.  Each algorithmic failure carries compounding costs  – 
legal liability, brand damage, regulatory scrutiny, and market limitations  – that far exceed the 
investment required for  incorporating diverse communities in AI  development practices upfront.

III. Harms of Excluding and Multicultural 
Communities  
Failure to incorporate multicultural perspectives in America ’s AI development roadmap isn’ t just 
a missed opportunity – it creates significant structural vulnerabilities that threaten our economic 
competitiveness and national security.  As we craft our AI Action Plan, understanding these 
potential harms helps clarify why multi -perspective development is not optional but essential.   
a. Economic Costs and Market Failures  
When AI systems fail to account for multicultural users and contexts, they leave significant value 
on the table while creating costly corrections later in the development cycle.  The economic 
impact of narrow AI development approaches is routinely underestimated by organizations rushing to market without considering diverse use cases.  This shortsightedness becomes even 
more consequential when we quantify the direct and indirect costs of exclusion – from expensive 
retrofitting and market limitations to bran d damage and litigation expenses that could have been 
avoided through multi- perspective design practices from the start.  
AI technologies developed with limited demographic inputs inevitably encounter market failures when deployed across diverse populations.  The healthcare algorithms that mistakenly direct 
fewer resources to Black patients with identical medical needs don ’t just reflect bias  – they 
represent market inefficiency.  These systems require expensive retrofitting, often after causing 
measurable economic harm through misallocation of resources.  
The global marketplace is increasingly diverse.  American AI companies that develop products 
optimized for limited demographic segments will find themselves outmaneuvered by 
international competitors who build more multi-perspective systems from the ground up.   
b. National Security and Strategic Disadvantages  
America ’s technological leadership isn’ t just an economic consideration  – it’s fundamental to our 
national security.  AI systems built without multicultural perspectives create exploitable 
vulnerabilities that adversaries can leverage against us.  
Narrow demographic representation in AI training and testing creates blind spots that can be 
weaponized.  When facial recognition systems perform inconsistently across different skin tones, or when natural language processing fails with certain dialects or speech patterns, these aren ’t 
merely technical limitations  – they’re potential security gaps.  As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
reminded us, “ Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. ”  In the AI context, bias 
anywhere creates vulnerability everywhere.  
The global competition for AI supremacy is intensifying.  Countries investing in multi -
perspective AI development gain strategic advantages by creating more robust, generalizable 


systems.  Wh en we exclude multicultural communities from our AI development ecosystem, we 
cede potential advantages to international competitors who recognize the strategic value of 
diversity in building more capable systems.  
IV. Actionable Recommendations 
To secure America’ s AI leadership while ensuring these technologies benefit all communities, we 
recommend concrete actions that leverage our nation’ s full innovative potential.  These 
recommendations focus on practical, market -driven approaches that reduce unnecessary 
regulatory burdens while maximizing economic opportunity and technological advantage.  Our 
roadmap consists of three strategic pillars: (a ) establishing Public -Private Partnerships for multi-
perspective AI that create economic incentives for d iverse development; ( b) expanding 
Education and Workforce Development initiatives that build talent pipelines in multicultural 
communities; and (c) implementing balanced Regulatory Frameworks and Standards that provide 
clarity without constraining innovation. 
a. Public-Private Partnerships for Multi -perspective AI 
America ’s competitive edge in AI requires collaborative approaches that unite government 
resources with private sector innovation.  We recommend establishing structured partnerships 
specifically designed to accelerate multi -perspective AI development. 
The creation of AI Innovation Zones in multicultural communities would provide tax incentives for companies establishing research and development facilities in underserved areas.  Like  
Opportunity Zones
9, these designations would encourage investment while building technology 
corridors that create sustainable economic growth.   The investments we make in people today 
will allow the US to lead the AI race going into the next generation.  These innovation zones 
plant the seeds for America ’s future AI leadership.  
We recommend establishing shared testing environments through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) where companies can evaluate AI systems across diverse 
populations before deployment.  This resource would reduce duplicate efforts across the industry 
while establishing clear benchmarks for system performance.  These environments should 
include standardized tools for bias detection and mitigation that companies of all sizes can 
access.  
Industry- led data trusts with community oversight would expand the availability of diverse 
training data while maintaining privacy and sovereignty.  By creating frameworks for responsible 
data sharing, we can accelerate the development of more robust AI systems while respecting 
community ownership of cultural information.   Properly implemented, these trusts would 
9 Pub. L. No. 115 -97, § 13823, 131 Stat. 2054, 2183 (2017). 


function as a form of community wealth -building that recognizes the value of diverse data 
contributions. 
b.Education and Workforce Development
Building America ’s AI workforce requires strategic investments in education and training across 
all communities.  As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The function of education is to teach one 
to think intensively and to think critically.”  Nowhere is this more important than in AI 
development. 
We recommend establishing AI Centers of Excellence at HBCUs and Minority -Serving 
Institutions (MSIs) through strategic public -private partnerships.  These centers would combine 
academic research with practical industry applications, creating pipelines from education to 
employment while advancing the state of AI science.  This approach recognizes the untapped 
talent in these institutions and provides the resources to develop it.  
Apprenticeship programs that connect diverse talent directly to AI development roles should be 
expanded through industry collaborations with community colleges and technical schools.  These 
“earn while you learn” models provide immediate economic benefits to participants while 
addressing critical workforce needs.  These apprenticeships build both individual skills and collaborative capabilities.  
K-12 AI literacy initiatives should be expanded in underserved school districts, with specialemphasis on early exposure to computational thinking and AI concepts.  These programs should
include teacher training components that build local capacity for ongoing education.  Early
exposure creates pathways to AI careers while developing critical thinking skills valuable acrossdisciplines.
c.Regulatory Framework and Standards
Effective governance requires balanced approaches that promote innovation while addressing legitimate concerns.  We recommend developing frameworks that provide clarity without 
imposing unnecessary constraints.  
Industry- led standards development with multicultural stakeholder participation would create 
practical guidelines for multi-perspective AI.  These voluntary standards should include metrics 
for measuring system performance across diverse populations, with certification processes that provide market recognition for compliant products.  Unlike rigid regulations, these standards can 
evolve rapidly alongside technological developments. 
Safe harbor provisions for companies following multi-perspective development practices would 
provide regulatory certainty while encouraging best practices.  These provisions would recognize 
good- faith efforts to implement multi -perspective design while maintaining appropriate 
accountability for outcomes.  This balanced approach promotes innovation while establishing clear expectations.  


Independent assessment methodologies developed through multi-stakeholder processes would 
provide transparent evaluation of AI systems ’ performance across diverse populations.  These 
assessments would help consumers make informed choices while providing developers with valuable feedback for improvement.  By establishing clear metrics for multi- perspective 
performance, these methodologies would drive market- based improvements without prescriptive 
regulations. 
As the MMTC has consistently advocated, these approaches recognize that prioritizing 
inclusivity in AI development is not just a moral imperative but a strategic advantage.  Implementing these recommendations  would help America secure its AI leadership position 
while ensuring these powerful technologies benefit all communities. 
The path forward requires sustained commitment from both government and industry.  By 
adopting these actionable recommendations, the AI Action Plan can establish America ’s enduring 
leadership in artificial intelligence while fulfilling our nation ’s promise of opportunity for all. 
V. Conclusion  
America stands at a pivotal moment in the AI revolution.  The choices we make now will 
determine not only our global competitiveness but also how equitably the benefits of these powerful technologies are distributed across our diverse society.  
The recommendations we’ve outlined provide a practical roadmap for advancing American AI leadership while ensuring all communities participate in and benefit from this technological 
transformation.  By establishing targeted public-private partnerships, building multi -perspective 
talent pipelines, and implementing balanced governance frameworks, we can create AI systems that leverage our nation’ s full innovative potential.  
The business case is clear: multi-perspective AI development isn’ t just the right thing to do  – it’s 
the smart thing to do.  Companies that develop AI with diverse input create more robust, 
marketable products while avoiding costly retrofits and regulatory complications.  Nations that leverage their full demographic diversity in AI development gain decisive advantages in global 
competition. 
As MMTC has demonstrated through decades of advocacy in technology policy, America thrives 
when we embrace our diversity as a strategic asset.  By incorporating these recommendations 
into the AI Action Plan, we can position the United States for enduring leadership in artificial 
intelligence while fulfilling our fundamental promise of opportunity for all Americans.
