Artists, writers and other creators deserve to own their own work and benefit from them. NO  
AI TRAINING should be allowed unless and until they can guarantee only people  
affirmatively opting in will be sampled for AI training. 
In particular, this means that there must be a method by which works shared (such as on  
Instagram) by people who are not the copyright owners are not treated as the owners for  
providing consent to AI training. 
Only when a work has an embedded tag that specifies it is an opt-in work should that work be  
allowed to train AI, and EVERY TIME it is used for such a purpose, the original owner of the  
work must be paid. 
Anything less is a brutal injustice.
