General Comment
Generative AI has raised significant concerns am ong creatives, particularly regarding its reliance on copyrighted m aterial. Many AI m odels
are trained on vast datasets scraped from  the internet, often including artwork, books, m usic, and other intellectual property without the
creators’ consent. This has led to ethical and legal debates about whether AI-generated content constitutes derivative work or outright
infringem ent. For artists, writers, and m usicians, the widespread use of AI-generated m edia threatens their livelihoods by flooding m arkets
with low-cost alternatives that devalue original work. Additionally, AI can m im ic specific artistic styles without proper attribution or
com pensation, effectively erasing the identity and effort of hum an creators. A fair policy is needed—one that prevents generative AI from
using copyrighted works for free and ensures that any works included in training data are identified, with creators properly com pensated.
Without such protections, the creative industry risks being underm ined by technology that profits from  unpaid labor while sidelining the
very artists who drive culture forward.
This is a m ajor concern for m e and our sm all start-up. We are a com pany that publishes speculative fiction, and we're already seeing how
the use of AI is eating away at our m arket. Generative AI does not create anything truly new; it is a glorified auto-com plete that ultim ately
underm ines what it m eans to be hum an. Any policy the governm ent im plem ents should not rely on the stolen intellectual property of
creatives.
