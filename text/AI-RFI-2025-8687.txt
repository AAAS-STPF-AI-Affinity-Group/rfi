General Comment
I do not believe the developm ent of AI tools should be protected in light of its extrem ely exploitative practices and useless applications.
Developers in this industry have repeatedly adm itted that LLM technologies used for generative AI cannot function without scraping the
resources of copyrighted hum an creativity. That is not a business, it is theft. The applications of generative AI are highly exaggerated and
this technology has largely existed as a corporate effort to fleece the Am erican public for the sake of profit m argins. Rem oving guardrails
from  this industry would not be in the interest of artists and creatives and would dam age their livelihoods.
