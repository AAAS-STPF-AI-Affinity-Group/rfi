General Comment
While I acknowledge that artificial intelligence com es in m any form s that can be beneficial, I also acknowledge that unregulated AI can be
both dangerous and unnecessary. 
Our current governm ent claim s they want to m ake m ore jobs for the Am erican people. If that is truly the goal, why would you support the
system s that seek to fully replace hardworking, everyday Am ericans? As an illustrator in the entertainm ent art industry, I have worked
hard for YEARS to develop m y skills. I am  tired of m y work, photos, and m y personal inform ation being viewed as "fair use" by OpenAI.
AI needs regulations in order to keep it lim ited to being used as a tool - not being used as a hum an replacem ent. Jobs need protection - I
have witnessed far too m any peers lose their jobs due to corporate greed involving AI. 
There is no reason OpenAI needs im m unity from  state copyright laws. I view it as an excuse to continue stealing data and avoid
com pensating creatives, all under the guise of national security. By allowing OpenAI to avoid regulations, you truthfully threaten the
security and rights of the Am erican people.
Allow us the right to give our own consent; no one should be autom atically "opted in" to training system s. 
I am  not anti-tech nor anti-AI. However, I do not support unregulated AI training, whether it be for creative reasons or otherwise. 
Thank you for your tim e.
