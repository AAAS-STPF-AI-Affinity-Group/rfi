General Comment
Large Language Models and the tools m ade with generative "AI" have been given too m uch credit for too little m aterial use. They are
over-hyped. OpenAI was a nonprofit for a reason before tech and venture capitalist figures like Sam  Altm an took over. The business that
exists is not profitable, supported by larger businesses on the prom ise of a ln am azing breakthrough. A breakthrough that m ight not be
com ing.
In the m eantim e, LLM tools are already affecting the livelihoods of thousands of Am ericans. Writers and artists are out of jobs. Actors are
striking to retain ownership of their FACES. And OpenAI and other com panies are chom ping at the bit to scrape every written text and
shove it into their m achine, regardless of who owns the lovingly-crafted words.
