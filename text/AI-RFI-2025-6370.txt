General Comment
I am  begging you to not let OpenAI use copyrights m aterial to train their AI, it is STEALING! I don't think AI has a place in the future of
the U.S, I think it is a m ajor threat! It steals jobs, it steals m aterial, it consum es so m uch energy, the big heads in the Governm ent want to
im plem ent it to control very sensitive sectors; if anything, AI should be outlawed and Open AI should be shut down or banned from
Governm ent affairs. Again, it steals from  the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off of theft. You cannot possibly support that.
Please stop OpenAI from  being able to m ake things worse. I don't m ean to be rude, but if you allow them  to do what they please, it's just
proof of how m any corrupt people are in the White House.
