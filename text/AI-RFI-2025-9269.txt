General Comment
I do not believe that generative AI like what is prom oted and used through program s like Open AI, Chat GPT, Grok, et cetera, has any
place in our country's future. Generative AI has proven over the last several years that its only function is to inevitably spread
m isinform ation, create fraudulent content or m edia, and steal the intellectual property of both individuals and any other m edia property.
The idea that generative AI should be im m une to regulation and scrutiny is blatantly irresponsible - think of a Senator or other public
official having an AI video, one that can be extrem ely difficult for the laym an to differentiate from  som ething real, that depicts a false
narrative using a trusted official's im age. Generative AI is dangerous, and does not offer enough value in return to anyone but the
com panies that peddle this technology. 
Legislation and regulation needs to be drafted that not only creates a clear distinction between generative AI and the artificial intelligence
m odels that are used in science, m edical, and m any other fields, but also that holds these generative AI com panies responsible for the kind
of theft and m isinform ation they've been capable of for years. This technology will only get m ore dangerous, without becom ing any m ore
useful or desirable to our country. Thank you for your careful consideration of this m atter.
