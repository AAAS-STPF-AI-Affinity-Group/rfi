General Comment
As both an IT consultant and an artist, it is extrem ely apparent that regulations and laws need to be put in place to protect US citizens.
Generative ai blatantly steals from  everyone and everything crossing the line in just about every copyrights case. It m ust be regulated and
now. They cannot be allowed to steal freely and with wreckless abandon. This isnt just im ages, but actual inform ation. I perform  HSRAs
for m any hospitals and they are in a constant uphill battle against bots and hackers using ai to exploit vulnerabilities and trick em ployees.
The scope is unprecedented and the support of this technology is only strengthening it in the hands of this nations enem ies. The sunken
cost fallacy of callous unthinking corporations should not be what leads us down this path. That is the path to com plete collapse.
