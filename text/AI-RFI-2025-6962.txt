General Comment
"AI Dom inance" is an oxym oron of a phrase. What sort of dom inance can a nation possess when its people surrender all their thinking to
m achines?
Learning Language Machines, com m only referred to as "AI," are unethical because it cannot function flagrantly violated copyright and
stealing m aterial to add to its algorithm s. LLMs are wasteful, because they require such high powered servers. And the top it all off, LLMs
don't even work all that well. "Hallucinations" in which the algorithm  sim ply invents new facts are com m on. There have to date been
m ultiple cases of lawyers attem pting to use AI generation for court docum ents, only for the m achine to cite the precedence of cases that
do not even exist!
Put it all together and it becom es clear: this current AI craze is a scam . The tech industry latched onto it after the ponzi schem e that was
the NFT m arket collapsed, and now they're desperately to push a terrible product that doesn't work and actively m akes life worse as the
way of the future. The sooner this nonsense ends, the better.
