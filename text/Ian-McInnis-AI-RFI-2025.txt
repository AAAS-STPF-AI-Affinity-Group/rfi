To whom i t may concern: America' s top AI labs are openly "racing" toward "superintelligence ," as 
are China's labs. W e do not know how to control current AIs or giv e them the right values, and it is 
vanishingly unlikely that we'll know how t o control AIs that can think 10x better and 1000x faster 
than any hu man. The leaders of these labs, along with the greatest machine learning researchers in 
history, agree: odds are high that superintelligence wipes o ut the human race. Even if we survive, 
we probably surrender all control of th e future to AI, which wil l effectively be a superior species. 
Orangutans do not shap e history. If superintelligence co mes soon, humans will b e in the place of 
orangutans. This race endangers all of humanit y, but we can stop. Citize ns do not want humans to 
be obsoleted by the superhuman AI that top lab s are explicitly aiming toward and expect to produce 
soon. We need the infrastructur e in place t o monitor development, and we nee d an international 
treaty to make it worldwide. This is *doable* and *enforceable *. The stakes ar e as high as anything 
has ever been. Please. Take some small step now. Lay the groundwork for saving the world. God 
bless y'all and God bless America.
