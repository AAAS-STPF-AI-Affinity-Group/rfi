Howdy,
I think giving AI developers carte blanche to utilize the works of studios, individuals, writers,
artists, and other creators, by disregarding their copyrights that protect their intellectualproperty, is an egregious affront against their livelihoods. Please do what you can to ensure AIdevelopers are held accountable for generating derivative material off of copyrighted works.The culture of the United States is made all the richer by our artists and writers, our musiciansand animators, our photographers and videographers. Please protect and prioritize thelivelihoods of the human Americans doing the hard work to enrich our nation.
Thank you,Thomas Schiffer-------------â€œThis document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no business-proprietary or confidential information. Document contents may be reused by the governmentin developing the AI Action Plan and associated documents without attribution."
