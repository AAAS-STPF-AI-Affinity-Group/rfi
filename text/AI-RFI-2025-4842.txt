General Comment
This utterly ridiculous "plan" serves only to undercut and steal from  actual artists and prevent them  from  having a livelihood. It is
unconstitutional to m ake what is essentially plagiarism  legal, and AI is a technological dead end that will never produce anything of value.
This needs to be shut down effective im m ediately.
