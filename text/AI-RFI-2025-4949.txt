General Comment
Hi,
Protecting AI from  being liable is throwing copyright law in the trash. Have you told Disney their intellectual property is up for grabs? I
think they and their legal departm ent would have a lot to say about OpenAI random ly generating an anthropom orphized black m ouse in
red short pants and calling it innovation.
The sim ple fact is OpenAI feeds off the hard work of living breathing artists who cannot m ake a living in creative fields. It seeks to replace
them  which will in turn assure OpenAI has no dataset to learn from . It is a self-defeating proposition. If OpenAI can recreate copyrighted
and tradem arked wit im punity, writers and artists sim ply won't share their art anym ore, assum ing they can afford to m ake any.
This m ove would be a costly m istake.
