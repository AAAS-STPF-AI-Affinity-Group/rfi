General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. Generative Ai is horrible for the environm ent. The im pact that it has had for
creators of all kinds and.for the environm ent is awful. There need to be laws in place to protect creators and everyone from  having their
work stolen in this m anner.
