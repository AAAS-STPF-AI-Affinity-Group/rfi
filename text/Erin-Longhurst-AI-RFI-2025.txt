Hello,
I am US citizen, registered to vote in Manatee County, FL, 34217. I work as a product
manager in Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that focus on field engineering andmaintenance.
As someone working in tech, I feel that generative AI is overhyped. Some 60% of queries
answered by AI are incorrect in some form or fashion, and adding training data will not solvethis issue. Moreover, the environmental impact of generative AI will, if it is not already doingso, take electrical power away from American citizens in some of the least-served areas, and Ido not feel that the current administration's plans to supplement power generation are going tohelp the ongoing climate crisis we're in. The so-called demand for better training data impactsfriends and family who work in creative fields by stealing their (copyrighted) work andfeeding it into the mill of "content" and regurgitating it on demand.
In short, I do not feel that generative AI companies should have access to private and/or
copyrighted data without consequences, and this AI Action Plan seems to be geared to freeingthem from those consequences. I do not and will not support this "action plan".
Regards,
Erin Longhurst
