General Comment
Out of the item s identified in the request for com m ent, I am  interested in the governm ent im plem enting technology to bolster the
explainability of AI outputs and the data they're trained on. Creating technology that can explain what inputs that AI used to m ake a
decision is crucial for trust and accurate decision m aking, and a public/private research collaboration.
