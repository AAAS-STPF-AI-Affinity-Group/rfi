General Comment
I am  an artist and I want the governm ent to stop legalizing of theft of the artists’ work by the AI. Works created by artists should not be
vultures upon by people who only believe in greed and profit. Nobody should be able to steal an artist’s work. AI is theft of our
intellectual property. It steals from  the works of creatives and only lines the pockets of the already wealthy. This is not the future the artists
of USA or the public want.
