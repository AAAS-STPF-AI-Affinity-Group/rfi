General Comment
Please do not listen to openAIâ€™s request to m ake them  im m une to copyright infringem ent. This is a horrible idea for as it will rem ove a
fundam entally im portant aspect of creation of art. If corporations are able to freely steal from  any citizen no one will have an incentive to
publish the works that are foundational for the ai software in the first place, as they will not have the assurance of being able to profit off of
their own works. It is a blatantly harm ful suggestion that flys in the face of everything that m akes the Am erican film  industry am azing, and
art as a whole. In addition, it will m ake the public less safe as corporations will slowly gain the ability to put out m ore convincing
m isinform ation.
