General Comment
Training AI on copyrighted and independently owned IP without proper com pensation to the original artists is theft and downright against
the very foundation of Am erican progress and strengthening the econom y. Rem oving the ability for owners of art to take m easures to
protect and be com pensated for their work cannot be excused by an argum ent of efficiency. This shows a lack of ingenuity and innovation
on the part of Am erican engineering, which we should be investing instead of AI m odels that waste energy and are harm ful to the
environm ent with their poor system s.
