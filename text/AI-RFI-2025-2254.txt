General Comment
AI is a waste of tim e and energy. For the severe cost of running it, you receive m ediocre results at best.The cost in resources is insane. It
invalidates the working relationships of all artists and creative team s. The gold rush chase of "easy m oney is a fools idea. 
All training "resources" used for AI are people's hard work. It's theft. If you use a product you should have to pay for it, that's how
business works. If som eone wanted to use YOUR work to train a m achine to do YOUR job, you wouldn't want that, would you? 
Art and all creative pursuits have a soul, even if said piece of work is poor quality. The fact som eone took the tim e to learn and try of their
own volition is what is so powerful. 
AI has none of that. There's no joy in creation. Just m eans to generate "content". Not the noble goal of creation.
