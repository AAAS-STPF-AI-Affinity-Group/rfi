General Comment
AI is a pointless boondoggle that's pushed by big tech com panies in order to cut costs, and putting governm ent resources into funding and
supporting AI is a waste of tax dollars. Furtherm ore, the idea that fewer restrictions will help tech com panies solve problem s with their AI
is absurd, and goes against the basic principles of intellectual property. Quite frankly, what's the difference between a tech com pany
downloading copyrighted m aterial to train their AI and a pirate downloading copyrighted m aterial to read or watch?
