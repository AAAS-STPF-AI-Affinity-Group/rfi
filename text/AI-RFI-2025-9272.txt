General Comment
This is a very dangerous plan and should not be carried out. Giving tech com panies carte blanche to the creative and academ ic works of
this country and the world so that they can m ake m oney off of others (while giving *nothing* back) is bad enough, but valid, non-
destructive uses for this technology are m inim al while the opportunities for abuse are m anifold.
We're already in a world where we let AI (which sim ply MAKES THINGS UP) determ ine where to send drones to kill people; im agine if
we apply this to everything else.
