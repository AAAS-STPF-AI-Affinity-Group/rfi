General Comment
As a working artist and designer, it is not “innovation” for an “AI” program  to take im ages generated by hum an artists and regurgitate
poor pastiches thereof. Rather, it is an attem pt to create an econom ic m odel that cuts out artists, by rem oving their ownership of and
control over their work and handing it over to “AI” com panies, who produce nothing that is not derivative. Do not negate artists’
copyright for they sake of a handout to snake oil m erchants who claim  to be “innovators.”
