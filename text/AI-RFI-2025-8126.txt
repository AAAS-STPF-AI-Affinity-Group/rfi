General Comment
AI, and particularly generative AI, is a dead end. Even with im provem ent, it is still fundam entally unable to create and requires the
copyrighted works of others to generate results. Along with that, as m ore AI m odels generate results with hallucinations, newer m odels
will take the flawed hallucinations into account creating an ouroborus of false and potentially deadly output.
It's a bad idea the entire way down.
