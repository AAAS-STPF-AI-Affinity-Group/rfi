General Comment
AI is theft, and rem oving accountability for this will dam age countless businesses. AI is not a useful or worthwhile technology and
intellectual property rights are im portant for any business to thrive. Anyone from  an independent artist to Disney will take losses if AI
com panies are allowed to steal from  them  like this.
