General Comment
Generative AI is so vile in the fact it it trained by and large without the perm ission of the individuals who's works are fed to it. AI used to
help spot m edical issues are fine when properly train, but by and large, AI in general is being used im properly.
Do not allow the use of these program s as they exist right now.
