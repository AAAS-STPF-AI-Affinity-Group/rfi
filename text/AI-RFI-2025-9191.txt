General Comment
Hello National Science Foundation
As a concerned citizen of the United States, I and m y fellow citizens fear that AI will be nothing short of disastrous for this nation. We do
not want to see AI take over everything from  governm ent to private business, nor do we want to see it stealing from  our own personal
data or creations. AI infringed on copyright and steals from  livelihoods of thousands. This should not be allowed to stand, especially in
businesses and corporations. AI in its current state is detrim ental to the United States and, as such, should not be given m ore data as a
m eans of creating a tem porary solution. I and m y fellows im plore the Foundation to not follow through with this plan. The com plete
destruction of property cannot be perm itted in this country.
