Luke Maddalena , 
My Name is L uke Maddalena and I am a second-semester senior at Avonwroth High 
School. I s tudied generative AI and its impact on the wrestling community in a course on AI 
and ethics this year. From my research, I think the current administration's viewpoint  on AI 
regulation is beneﬁcial to society. The innovation of AI will support what needs support and 
leave alone communities that won’t beneﬁt from AI ﬁlling in such as the wrestling 
community. Communities built on physical growth and human interaction will not need the progress of generative AI however AI’s progression will not disturb the future of the wrestling community. I believe that we can live in a world where humans thrive from the utilization of AI while keeping tradition, culture, and values re levant in the social and 
economic world. Holding back AI’s progress in the hope of preserving human control over the world will only hurt us in the long run. AI is completely situational and in situations where it is not as appropriate like the wrestling community, it can remain in the backseat. This administration's viewpoint, and my research in the course, says that AI will be a tool and progress in the future, but not replace humans.
