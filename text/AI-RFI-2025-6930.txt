General Comment
AI is nothing m ore than a tool to steal from  creatives who spend their lives developing skills and producing work. By allowing it to legally
scrape through people's work, it will disrupt their copyright on their products and take away livelihoods. 
We do not want this.
There is no reason for this. 
Do not allow this.
