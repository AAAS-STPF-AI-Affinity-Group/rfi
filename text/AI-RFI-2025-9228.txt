General Comment
As som eone who wishes the academ ic field, the idea of a m achine stealing m y work then allowing a com pany to claim  it as their own is
not only horrifying, but disgusting. I believe individuals are entitled to their work, not a m achine or a com pany that did nothing to earn it.
Allowing AI to have this m uch power would kill the ability for individuals to strive and create, and would instead open the door for
m ediocrity created by an algorithm .
