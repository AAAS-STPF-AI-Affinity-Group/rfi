General Comment
This regulation will allow for corporations to steal whatever they want with zero reproductions, and thus rem ove any incentive for the
creation of intellectual property on a sm all scale. This only benefits the upper classes of our society and is deeply hypocritical. There are
too m any stories of people pirating and getting fined m illions of dollars for single downloads. This allows corporations to steal anything and
everything without fear. This regulation m ust be stopped.
