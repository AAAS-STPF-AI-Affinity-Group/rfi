General Comment
What is currently being called Artificial Intelligence is certainly artificial but not intelligent. This system , as currently constituted, grabs all the
inform ation that can be fed to it, and spits it back out based on the probability that one word will follow the next based on whatever query
has been subm itted to it. 
It can also be wrong, and confidently so. And if you have no idea what the answer is to the query you're subm itting, you will be vulnerable
to this algorithm  when it is wrong, because it will be wrong.
