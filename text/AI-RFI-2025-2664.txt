General Comment
I request that you prioritize, above all, the risk of hum an extinction from  AI, which has been highlighted by m any of the leading experts in
the field:
Dan Hendrycks (director at Center for AI Safety): > 80%
Geoffrey Hinton (1 of the 3 godfathers of AI): 10-50%
Yoshua Bengio (1 of the 3 godfathers of AI): 20%
Em m ett Shear (form er interim  CEO of OpenAI): - 5-50%
I also request that you devote m ore resources to investigate AI consciousness. If AIs will soon be a m ajority of the world's intelligent
population, it is essential that we understand if the AIs are having subjective experiences of the world.
