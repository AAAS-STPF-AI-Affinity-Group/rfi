General Comment
Generative AI is a technology that stifles innovation and steals from  actual experts in creative and technical fields. 
It can only exist through what am ounts to plagiarism , the resources necessary to m ake it functional on an industrial scale are not only
im practical, they are ecologically devastating, and the results of it are incoherent, m ediocre, and unacceptable for any rem otely serious
academ ic, judicial, or legislative body to consider using in wide scale.
