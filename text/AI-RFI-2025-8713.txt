General Comment
AI is legalized theft of art and other works by fools who bet on a terrible product, and are trying to cover their losses by shoving it into
every facet of every product they can. Rem oving our copyright laws in favor of perm itting big corporations to steal from  artists and other
creatives is a betrayal of art itself. AI scrapers are already destroying sm all businesses artists. This cannot be allowed to continue.
