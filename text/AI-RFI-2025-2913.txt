General Comment
Generative AI is a theft engine and it's stealing from  ME and the creative Am erican populace. There is no acceptable future for generative
AI and it should be stam ped out with force, with resources redirected to m achine-learning utilities in m edical and environm ental fields, i.e.
cancer detection, prevention, and treatm ent. Technologies that would save lives instead of destroy workforces and the environm ent. To
fund or condone generative AI is anti-Am erican.
