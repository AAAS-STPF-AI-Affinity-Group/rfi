As a published author and small businessman who depends on the fruits of my creative labor
to make a living, I absolutely would not want to see copyright protections weakened for anyreason. If big tech companies want to profit off of my work, they should pay me for theprivilege or face the liability of court proceedings. Giving these companies free reign toappropriate any material they can suck up will destroy America's cultural production anddiscourage individuals and companies from other countries from publishing within our bordersout of justifiable concern that their work will be pirated. Far from strengthening our nation, thedigital boondoggle known as "AI" will hollow out our creative arts and our researchcommunity, and make us dumber as a people.
