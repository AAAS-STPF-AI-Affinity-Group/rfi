The terms of this comment are very simple, opening policy of AI to strictly capital innovation
is dangerous, one of the gravest national security risks and economic tar pit for anyone thatrelies on copyright to maintain the value of their original asset. Terminating regulations thatwould risk copyright protections of individuals and control over derivations of their workwithout a legal budget to maintain it would ruin entire creative and highly innovative researchsectors. the majority of learned individuals on the topic of AI are very vocal about theseissues, i do not need to regurgitate positions against, as council should understand they musttake popular opposition in good faith, and include the compendium of remarks that exist in thecorpus of discourse. Should power be granted to private interests to freely reign over thedeployment of AI with infrastructural demands that far exceed the capacity and will of thecommon citizen, there will be dire economic consequences. This deployment should not berushed, and like most technology, it should be adopted in consistent and intentional stagedways, to reduce risk and ensure equity to access, not in the interest of stakeholders who standto profit from cartel like behavior in technology. Thank you for considering this commentwhen discussing the issue of an AI action plan.
