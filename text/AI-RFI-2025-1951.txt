General Comment
This is such a foolish concept. Big tech half-lives thinking they just own rights to content, just because said consent is said to be singed off
in ToS longer than the Bible. Yet, I im agine this m eans little to you. Well, You'll get your AI data alright. I suppose it'll be a sort of
Ouroboros effect. When your data isn't trained ethically and transparently, ends up with foundations built on weak grounds, and falls apart
in an expensive fashion further down the line, this is sim ply the natural progression.
