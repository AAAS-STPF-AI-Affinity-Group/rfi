General Comment
Open AI being exem pt from  copyright will harm  all form s of business and financial progress in the US by stealing intellectual property and
products owned by com panies and individuals. By the rules of capitalism , if a com pany cannot be successful on its own m erits with its
own products in the m arketplace, then it should not survive. AI has proven itself to be inefficient, ineffective, costly, and useless in any
context. Propping up a failed business is a waste of governm ent tim e and m oney, especially when it will only drain other com panies
resources and underm ine the profit of all other industries it steals from .
