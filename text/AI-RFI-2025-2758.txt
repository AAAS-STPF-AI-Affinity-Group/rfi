General Comment
As m uch as AI has grown to a populous status as a cost-cutting idea, it won't work in the long run. AI does have a part in the workplace,
but not as a replacem ent for the artists, who are hired and m ake a living off their profession. AI having m ajor restrictions into how it can
be used for com panies that produce m edia/entertainm ent is key, to preserve the anim ation industry as a whole, and to allow those who do
it for work to continue to m ake a living from  it. Say No to AI!
