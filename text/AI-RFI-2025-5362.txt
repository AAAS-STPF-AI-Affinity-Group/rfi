General Comment
Do you want the death of hum an creativity, art, knowledge, m usic, and expression? Approving this will destroy everything we’ve set out
and created up until now and leave us with nothing but soulless and uncreative husks if they’re form er selves. Not to m ention nobody
wants this. NOBODY. Except people who have far m ore m oney than anyone has any right right of.
