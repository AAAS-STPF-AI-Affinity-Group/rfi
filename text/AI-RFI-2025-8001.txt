General Comment
Neither Elon Musk nor Sam  Altm an should be anywhere near this project. They have proven them selves to be deeply unserious
technologists who are only using regulatory capture to further their private business ventures. They do not have the people's best interests
at heart.
Additionally, GenAI should have rem ained in the realm  of academ ia until they found a way to train m odels on data that they actually own.
Or we could have abandoned GenAI and stuck with m ore traditional m odels or whatever discovery com es next. As it stands, the AI
Action Plan is better positioned to bolster spurious claim s m ade by a bunch of snake oil salesm an than do anything to actually benefit the
Am erican worker. People will get laid because a bunch of know-nothing CEOs believe it can replace jobs they couldn't do them selves
and don't understand all while we m ake the rich even richer.
