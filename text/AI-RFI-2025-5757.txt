General Comment
I do not believe that OpenAI, or any form  of generative AI, can exist and train it's data in good consciousness. To dem and access to the
hard work of others for the sake of stealing it and claim ing it under your own creation is theft, not to m ention how m uch of this is and will
be done without the consent of creators. These creators are the ones putting in the real effort into honing a craft and perfecting a skill,
OpenAI can only m ake a poor attem pt at m im icking what is a uniquely hum an trait of creation. I don't think we should be expected to roll
over and accept a total breech of personal data sim ply because tech giants want it. I would not and will not ever consent to m y own
works being trained on. 
Who's to say these tech com panies that m ake prom ise of "helpful" generative AI won't sell *our* data *our* works and info to the highest
bidder? We are not data to be bought and sold as pleased. People are already hurting trying to find work and support them selves, the
forced norm alization of this AI will only exasperate this as businesses seek reasons to cut costs and replace real hum ans to do their work.
Allowing OpenAI to continue like this m ust be resisted.
