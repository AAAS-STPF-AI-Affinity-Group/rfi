General Comment
As an author, AI has negatively im pacted by livelihood. It has stolen authors' and illustrators' copyrighted works, and the big tech
com panies have repeatedly adm itted they have to steal our work for their AI m odels. It would be a travesty to the creative fields in the
U.S., fields that innovate and entertain, if OpenAI were given im m unity from  copyright laws. This is theft, and they should not be allowed
to destroy the livelihood of so m any U.S. citizens. 
Studies have also shown that AI searches are wrong a large percentage of the tim e. We should not let the works of hard-working people
be stolen for a subpar product that is overhyped, inferior, and unethical.
