General Comment
I do not believe that generative AI has any benefit to the people of the United States, or its future. It's training has been done unethically,
and it takes jobs away from  creatives. Be less concerned about im m igrants taking jobs and be m ore concerned about Gen AI taking jobs
and doing them  worse. A m achine does not have em otion, and therefore, cannot create art with any value.
