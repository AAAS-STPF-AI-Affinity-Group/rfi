General Comment
AI, while it has its uses, objectively cam e into this world far too soon, and it's shakily clim bed its way up using scraps, and all we have to
stop it are shakily regulations which fools like Trum p are trying to break down without realizing what they're going to do. While I
personally have a curiosity of where this new technology m ay go, it's already ruining school system s and overtaking artists, which is all the
m ore reason to stop tossing fuel into the fire and m ake com panies responsible for the AI they have unleashed. Free use benefits the
people, but in this case, it just benefits corporations.
