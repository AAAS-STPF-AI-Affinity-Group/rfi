General Comment
Generative AI threatens the livelihoods of m illions of Am ericans and should be regulated and restricted to protect them . Once this genie is
out of the bottle, there's no putting it back in, and we can't afford to get it wrong. The profit m otive of tech com panies who show disdain
for artists and those their technologies will affect can't be placed above the wellbeing of the people and the art that has helped m ake
Am erica the diverse, influential, inspiring nation it is.
