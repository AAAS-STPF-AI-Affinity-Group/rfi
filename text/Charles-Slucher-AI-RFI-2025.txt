Guardrail s and protections are needed to prevent cyber security risks, fraud, and domestic 
terrori sm. Legal and ethical guidelines are needed before there is a disaster not after. Our 
government shouldn't be changing the laws to protect it's most powerful lobbyists but 
rather should be enforcing the laws meant to protect it's citizens. This appears to be an 
attempt to protect wealthy investors whose technology is based entirely on stealing the 
labor of everyone in order to put Americans out of work.
