General Comment
AI has fundam entally proven itself to be nothing m ore than a tool for the rich to be able to m ake m ediocre art. If a piece of technology
requires access to literally everything in order to function, to train itself off every piece of data online, steal it, and then replicate it as m ass
produced slop for the m asses to m indlessly enjoy, do we really need it?
