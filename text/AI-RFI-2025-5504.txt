General Comment
Copyright is the foundation of the Am erican econom ic m iracle, from  the creative arts to the tech sector. It prom ises that people who
innovate m ay leverage that work to achieve the Am erican dream .
Gen AI is seeking legalized theft of that work, and a business or even an industry that cannot survive without theft does not deserve to
survive at all.
The governm ent m ust hold them  accountable at all phases, or risk destroying the prom ise of private property rights, a founding pillar of of
civil rights and econom ic prosperity.
