General Comment
Generative AI is a plague, other types of AI m ay have som e uses but it should all be regulated and have very necessary requirem ents to
ham per any harm  that will com e with it. Generative AI steals alm ost all of its inform ation infringing on artists and writers (or anyone who
posts any sort of picture or writing) copyright, privacy, and livelihood. It looses jobs, It's bluff fools bosses into thinking it can do a better
job and then creates m ore hassle for the few people left who are forced to work with it. It creates so m uch disinform ation and is spreading
distrust as its getting harder and harder to tell real im ages from  fake ones. It is frequently wrong and gives people bad inform ation that
sounds right so it takes an expert to know the difference and we can't all be experts, people can and do get hurt from  this. It's whole
purpose is to take m any parts of living and interaction away from  hum ans. It is overall a negative for hum anity and affects our daily quality
of life.
