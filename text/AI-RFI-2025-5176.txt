General Comment
AI profits off of theft, and its advocates have done a piss-poor job of tr ying to co nvince me that this isn’t the case. It s hould have no place 
in the future of t he US, and, gee, I do n’t know, as a human be ing I also find it hard to s upport so mething that directly sabota ges the 
livelihoods of artists who have worked hard - like, you know, ACTUALLY worked - to hone and perfect their respecti ve crafts. AI 
is the lazy way out, and it literally &^% on what I thou ght was supposed to be the American ideal of hard work bei ng recog nized 
and rewarded.  Please stop &^% all over people for the sake of your mindless, petty greed. Thank you.
