General Comment
Am erica's no. 1 export is undeniably our culture: Movies, TV, Music, Gam es. If AI is allowed unabated access to all creative works
m ade by Am ericans innovation and iteration will stop. AI can create endlessly but it's incapable of generating new ideas, new product.
Our cultural export will stagnate and art and m edia flourish abroad with hum an creativity and not just our entertainm ent econom y but our
national identity is whither and die.
