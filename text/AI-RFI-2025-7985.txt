General Comment
As an English teacher, AI is m aking m y job harder every year because students use it to plagiarize on work or believe that frequently
incorrect AI sum m aries on Google are true. It doesn't just fool teenagers but m any adults as well. Why are we prioritizing technology
that's pushing frequently false inform ation online? We already have too m uch false inform ation online. This does not fundam entally im prove
any of our lives.
AI m odels are also stealing the hard work of writers and artists across all fields and practices. It fundam entally cannot survive without
theft, and its outsized energy usage is dam aging to the environm ent. It should have no place in our future as a country.
