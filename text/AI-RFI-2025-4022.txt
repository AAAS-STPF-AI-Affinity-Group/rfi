General Comment
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States, it will only take away.
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft of MANY industries. it will harm  m any people's incom es and hurt
us.
* AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public, it does not add anything to the public.
