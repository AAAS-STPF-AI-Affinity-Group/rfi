General Comment
I oppose to training AI on other people IP. OpenAI and google do not have the right to take m y inform ation to train their AI m odel.
Furtherm ore, I feel AI is a ham m er searching for a nail. There m eat be som e nice things to be gained from  it but over all it is over blown
but because it has been so expensive to train the tech elite are desperate to find a use for it. 
No com pany should be im m une for infringem ent due to their service or product. If these AI com panies can program  their product to send
rockets to space and provide custom er service, why canâ€™t they be coded to prevent copyright infringem ent. 
AI is deeply biased. ChaptGPT has been found to say awful and horrid things. Bias in coding needs to be addressed. 
Finally, I am  deeply disturbed by the power suck that AI is causing. Why should we have to power a vanity project. 
There are so m any reason technology m ust be regulated. This is not the wild Wild West. Regulate it.
