General Comment
As a person working in a creative field (illustration and com ic book art in m y case) I am  very worried about the push from  m any AI and
tech com panies to be allowed to ignore copyright when training their m odels. 
AI com panies are arguing that it should be fair use to take the work we create and post online (either for prom otion or for profit) to create
im ages that will com pete directly with us. This is already starting to have an effect in the book cover m arket and in art m ade for video
gam es, and while it hasn't yet had m uch of an im pact on com ics it feels like it will only be a m atter of tim e. I do not think the things AI can
create will ever be very good, but I do worry that the draw of not having to pay som eone for their work will be irresistible. We could end
up in a situation where the next generation of artists (or, to bring up another field, the next generation of coders) never get the opportunity
to develop their skills. We could lose our culture to a flood of averaged im ages, bland text, and incom prehensible software if we're not
careful.
Sim ply put: AI is just code, not a person. It certainly has applications, including in creative fields, but it is no where near the point where it
can replace hum ans, if that's ever desirable. We should be very careful about how m uch power we give a statistical m odel over the art we
interact with and the software we use every day.
