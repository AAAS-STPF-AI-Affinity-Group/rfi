General Comment
So-called "AI" is a drain on resources, is unprofitable, is riddled with errors, and is good for nothing m ore than pum ping m ore slop into the
world. It saves no tim e, and in fact wastes it, due to having to correct the errors present in the text and im agery it produces. 
Resources should instead be placed into organizations like the NIH, EPA, and CDC. Not a single cent of governm ent m oney or labor
should be wasted on this endeavor.
