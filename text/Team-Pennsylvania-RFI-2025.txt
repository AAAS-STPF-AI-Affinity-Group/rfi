RE:  AI Action Plan  
Team Pennsylvania is pleased to submit this response to the National Science 
Foundation’s Request for Information regarding the development of a National Arti ﬁcial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan.  
As a unique non-partisan nonpro ﬁt, Team Pennsylvania’s mission is to accelerate the 
economic growth of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through public-private 
partnership. Pennsylvania’s robust energy infrastructure, its rich legacy in 
manufacturing, its position in the semiconductor supply chain, and its globally 
recognized research institutions position the Commonwealth to play a critical role in 
advancing the nation’s AI economy.  The rapid acceleration of AI development presents both unprecedented opportunities 
and signiﬁcant challenges. AI has the potential to transform key sectors such as 
manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, and energy by enhancing productivity, 
optimizing resource use, and driving innovation. This transformation also poses 
challenges, including the need for robust infrastructure, increased energy demands, 
and intentional efforts to accelerate AI adoption across geographies and business 
types. The timeliness of aligning federal policies and tools to drive AI applications will 
be essential to making industries more efﬁcient, effective, and economically stronger.

1. Developing Supercomputing Infrastructure through Adequate Energy
Supply
AI model development and deployment demands increasingly greater computing 
capacity, making the availability of reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy 
essential. Pennsylvania’s central position within the PJM Interconnection region makes 
it a key hub for data center infrastructure. Federal AI policy should prioritize the 
development of supercomputing infrastructure by ensuring adequate energy supply, 
modernizing grid infrastructure, and incentivizing energy efﬁciency innovations in data 
centers. Collaboration between energy providers, data center operators, and public 
agencies will be critical to meet the evolving energy demands of AI without 
compromising grid reliability. 
To support the growth of AI applications, an “all of the above” energy strategy is 
essential. Pennsylvania’s diverse energy resources—including nuclear, natural gas, and 
renewable energy—provide a strong foundation to meet the escalating energy 
demands of data centers. Federal support for expanding nuclear energy capacity, 
modernizing natural gas infrastructure, and integrating renewable energy sources will 
bolster Pennsylvania’s ability to become a national leader in supercomputing 
infrastructure. These investments will not only enable the scaling of AI activities but 
also create new economic opportunities across the region. 
2. Facilitating Scalable AI Applications through Commercialization and
Regional Engagement
Pennsylvania is home to a strong concentration of world-class universities conducting 
cutting-edge AI research and producing AI innovations. However, bridging the gap 
between academic research and scalable commercial applications remains a challenge. 
Federal AI policy should prioritize funding mechanisms and public-private partnerships 
that accelerate the transition of practical, use-inspired AI technologies from lab to 
market. Establishing demonstration projects and expanding regional innovation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

clusters can help ensure that AI breakthroughs lead to tangible economic bene ﬁts for 
businesses and communities across rural and urban geographies. 
Geographic engagement is critical to ensuring the distribution of AI’s economic 
bene ﬁts. Federal investments can help connect AI innovation ecosystems with 
communities, including smaller cities and rural regions, where strong tech bases, 
growing populations and robust venture capital may not exist. This approach will 
enable a broad range of businesses and workers to participate in the AI economy 
across the entire country. Small and mid-sized manufacturers—such as those located 
across Pennsylvania’s rural landscape—stand to beneﬁt signi ﬁcantly from AI 
applications that enhance operational ef ﬁciency, improve supply chain management, 
and drive product innovation. Ensuring these businesses participate in an AI economy 
will strengthen not only Pennsylvania’s manufacturing base but will contribute to more 
resilient regional economies across the US. 
Additionally, AI presents transformative opportunities for agriculture and the farming 
community, which is a signiﬁcant aspect of Pennsylvania’s economy. Federal 
investments should prioritize AI applications that improve crop yields, optimize 
resource use, and enable precision agriculture while also making these advancements 
ﬁnancially and operationally accessible to farmers. By integrating AI solutions into 
agricultural operations, rural communities can bene ﬁt from increased productivity and 
sustainability, further underpinning the United States’ food supply. 
3. Leveraging Pennsylvania’s Strengths in Manufacturing and the
Semiconductor Supply Chain
Pennsylvania’s long-standing manufacturing prowess, combined with emerging 
leadership in the semiconductor supply chain, positions the state to contribute 
signiﬁcantly to the nation’s AI hardware and infrastructure needs. Federal policy should 
prioritize investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and advanced 
packaging facilities, particularly in regions where existing manufacturing infrastructure 
can be leveraged. Collaboration between public and private partners can accelerate

the scaling of semiconductor production and help address critical supply chain 
vulnerabilities. 
Conclusion 
Team Pennsylvania stands ready to partner with public and private sector stakeholders 
to ensure that Pennsylvania plays a central role in building a robust AI economy. By 
developing supercomputing infrastructure through adequate energy supply, facilitating 
scalable AI applications through commercialization, and engaging communities large 
and small, rural and urban, the United States can extend its leadership in rapid 
advancements in key industries that have strong global impacts. 
We appreciate the opportunity to provide input into the development of the National 
AI Action Plan and look forward to ongoing collaboration to shape the future of AI in 
the United States. 
Sincerely, 
Abby Smith  
President & CEO
