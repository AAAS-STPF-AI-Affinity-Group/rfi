General Comment
Writing is not only beautiful and powerful, but we learn so m uch through the writing process of organizing, editing, and revising. As a
professor and a writer I believe that writing is a m uscle that we strengthen through practice. Multiple studies have shown that reliance on
generative AI leads to cognitive decline, especially in young people. We m ust preserve writing as art and as a critical thinking tool.
