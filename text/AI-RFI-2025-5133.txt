General Comment
The developm ent of AI m ust take into consideration all copyright laws and the rights of artist and creators who's works are used to train
these m odels.
It is not a burden nor a hindrance to have accountable, ethical, and m eaningfully sourced data for training. Paying people for their works is
part of society, this is how we function.
Stealing for profit, gains, or even training AI system s is wrong. We m ust uplift each other with AI, otherwise when all that we have m ade
or can do is done with AI we will own nothing and be able to create nothing.
Plus AI is terrible right now even with stolen data, m ore stolen data isn't going to m ake it good. We need to break down these large
com panies who stifle and kill creativity and start investing in innovative ways to develop AI.
Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and all these other tech giants are what is killing our ability to thrive and develop good tech. They won't
bring us to AI suprem acy. Instead widespread researched and funded team s will, which is why Deepseek beat us to it, they're not m oney
hungry siphons on society.
