General Comment
My nam e is Alex Rowe and I am  a m em ber of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High School. I com pleted a sem ester course on
AI and Ethics and studied the im pacts of Generative AI on Am erican lives and technology. Executive Order 14179 will be a m ix of
im provem ent and disruption about the policy of national security and defense because rem oving regulations on AI can have certain
benefits, but also som e disadvantages. Am ericans use AI in 2025 in over half of their daily lives. AI is so prom inent that you can find it
everywhere, in fast food chains, in m assive retail corporations, in com panies that are advancing self-driving technology, and there is so
m uch m ore. With this inform ation, people would be able to use AI however they want m uch m ore than is already available, and they could
m ake anything they want. This is very good in theory, and can im prove creativity and advance what hum ans can do further, but there is
also the fact that not all hum ans are benevolent with each other. Hum ans who are at odds with each other can take on AI with m ore ability
than ever before and Am erican lives could be put in danger. How will proper security m easures be put in place to m ake sure unregulated
AI doesnâ€™t bring harm  to the people and other aspects of our country?
