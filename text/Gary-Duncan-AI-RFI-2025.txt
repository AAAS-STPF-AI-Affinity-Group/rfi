To Whom It May Concern:
Hello! My name is Gary Duncan, and I am writing as a concerned citizen regarding the development of the AI  
Action Plan. The executive order that brought about the intent to create this action plan stands in direct contrast to  
the one put in place by the Biden administration, which at least tried to put some sort of guardrails toward  
responsible development of AI. I have a number of friends whose hobbies, jobs, and livelihoods could be threatened  
by unrestrained AI. Often, the learning and models used unfairly take and focus on information and ideas they’ve  
put out, assimilating it and putting out what, quite frankly, can only be described as stolen goods. As someone who  
is tired of the irresponsible spread of AI and AI learning models, I would like to register my formal objection to the  
development of this plan. Much of this country has had enough of the unfettered spread of AI and AI learning  
models. Our current President has signs of dementia, and as such, cannot be trusted to sign off on anything AI-
related. Please consider this input as you move forward regarding the development (read: destruction) of your AI  
Action Plan, for the sake of everyone who is just plain tired of AI’s spread to every facet of our lives.
Sincerely,
Gary Duncan
