General Comment
The result of changing fair use in such a sweeping m anner will only hurt Am ericans in the long term . 
Machine-learning program s, including those m ade by OpenAI and Google, have already been harvesting copyrighted m aterials. It is the
reason there are num erous suits in court alleging these program s are stealing from  Am erican citizens. If one would not allow som eone to
walk into their house and take anything they like without repercussion, why in the world are these com panies acting like it is fine for them
to do the sam e with Am ericans' creative work? 
Why be an Am erican artist, m usician, writer, film  m aker, actor? When nothing you m ake is protected, why m ake anything at all? Perhaps
the current president should look at his own creative work and consider if he likes the fact it will be used by any com pany claim ing to
m ake a m achine-learning program  without any form  of reim bursem ent.
The excuse that China is som ehow a loom ing boogiem an is laughable, too. They sim ply used the opensource libraries available to m ake
their own program s. What will stop them  from  taking all the copyrighted data harvested by OpenAI or Google if this is allowed to go
forward? Nothing.
Copyright exists for a reason, and is one of the rights we enjoy as citizens when we create. The attack on copyright by these "AI"
com panies needs to be halted, and actual research be done into why they supposedly need access to any and all m aterials in existence.
