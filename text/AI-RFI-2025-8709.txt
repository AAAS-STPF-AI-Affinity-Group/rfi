General Comment
AI in no way should be exem pt from  the laws of copyright if every other citizen and entity m ust abide by them . This is an unfair favoring of
an already questionably ethical technology that m ust be studied in itâ€™s im pacts on society and the lives of working people it will put out of
work rather than given the full authority to steal copyrighted works. This is m eant to replace a workforce, not assist it.
