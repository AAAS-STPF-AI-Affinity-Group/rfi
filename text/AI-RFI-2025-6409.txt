General Comment
The best Action plan around AI is to nuke it from  orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
Does that sound fam iliar? Like copyright infringem ent? then you're fam iliar with what AI is - a serial thief of content that isn't even able to
guarantee accuracy in its response - I like Cory Doctorow's description of AI as a 'stochastic parrot' regurgitating the m ost com m on
answer, whether it is correct or not.
It takes m ore resources to provide worse quality, but because it externalizes the costs, com panies think it's a boon. 
Besides the m illions of people who have had their creations stolen, it offers the ability to provide fake results (either intentionally or not -
both of which are terrible for our country).
The only action plan toward AI the governm ent should im plem ent is holding these com panies to account for all the copyright and
tradem ark violations they have com m itted, and m aybe investigating their accounting to see where all the so-called m oney really is. Maybe
listen to a little Ed Zitron and Cory Doctorow to get a sense of what the real scam  behind AI is and do som ething to head it off before it
joins the other catastrophes that are currently sending our country down the drain.
