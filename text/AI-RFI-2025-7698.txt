General Comment
Allowing AI to violate copyright will hollow out the creative industries in this country and lead to a m assive collapse in the entertainm ent
industry. Anyone working in the entertainm ent industry will leave for a country that cares about their intellectual property rights. AI
generated content is an insult to life itself.
