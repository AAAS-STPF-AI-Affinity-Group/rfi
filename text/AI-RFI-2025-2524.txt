General Comment
Generative AI is ruining the econom y and will take jobs from  so m any people. I am  one of those people who has lost incom e, security,
and m y em ploym ent because there was no AI oversight and m y com pany thought it good enough to use gen AI to replace m y work. This
is not the Am erican dream , this is not what m achines are supposed to do for people. Let’s use AI that isn’t trained on unpaid work to do
the chores people don’t want to do, cleaning and laundry and garbage disposal, so that all people can be m ore productive, m ore creative,
and live happier lives.
