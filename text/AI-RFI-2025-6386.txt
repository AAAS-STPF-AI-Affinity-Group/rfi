General Comment
I'm  shocked and appalled that this action plan is not to block and cease any operations from  OpenAI from  scraping the works of artists
and writers that pour their hearts and souls into them . This is theft, pure and sim ple, and the US Governm ent should be working to stop
this nonsense now rather than actively encourage it. AI can be useful in m edical and scientific settings but has no place in creative ones.
Setting back the hum anities and actively harm ing creative people to m ake som e tech billionaires feel better about their word and art
stealing m achines is despicable.
