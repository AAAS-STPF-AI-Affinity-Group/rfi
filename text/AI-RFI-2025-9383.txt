General Comment
AI is a powerful tool, which m ust be carefully regulated to safeguard against m isuse. Rules m ust be in place to protect sm all businesses
and independent creatives from  the depredations of those who seek to profit off the hard work of others, using AI as a way to launder
ideas, filling the m arket with low-effort products without adding anything of value, thus debasing the industry as a whole and harm ing
consum ers.
