Hello, 
My name is Jackson Bailey, I have been a California citizen of the US for my entire life, and I
have an active role in the artist community, as well as the general populace. I am in fullsupport of the plan for the Biden-Harris AI Executive Order 14110
executive order of 14110
created on October 30, 2023 (Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use ofArtificial Intelligence), which limits the private sector's ability to innovate in AI by imposinggovernment requirements restricting private sector AI development and deployment. Pleaseunderstand that AI, despite being around for over a year now, has proven to be completelyuseless in the eyes of
  bettering humanity. Generative AI does not help anyone. It does not
create anything helpful, it does not prevent catastrophes, it does not do anything constructiveto the human condition. It is a mass imitation of our artwork, and of copyrighted materials. Ioppose executive order 14179, signed by President Donald Trump on January 23, 2025. DONOT LET THIS GO THROUGH, PLEASE. THIS HELPS NO ONE. Executive Order 14179
