General Comment
As an artist by trade, the idea that m y livelihood - m y intellectual property - can’t be saved from  theft by AI training is truly a horrible
thought. What role does governm ent fill but to protect the citizens from  exploitation?
And what a horrible idea that an artist could spend years training and learning and working hard to build their craft, only to have it pillaged
in an instant by a new technology, twisted, and spit back out for som eone else’s profit. This technology can’t exist without the hard work
of artists, and relies on their lack of consent to turn any kind of profit. 
By allowing AI to underm ine copyright law, and scrape artists hard work to train their m odels, you will be in essence m aking a huge swath
of the Am erican workforce obsolete. You will be harm ing thousands and thousands of hardworking Am ericans for the profit of a few.
You will be doing to artists what was done to the Midwest rust belt when industry m oved to china. And the effects on our art and m edia
will be the sam e. Cheap, crappy replacem ents. Please, do the right thing, and hold ai up to the sam e standards that the rest of us m ust live
by.
