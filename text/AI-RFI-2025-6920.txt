General Comment
Art belongs to the artists: that's why we have copyright law. There's no benefit to hum anity to let artificial intelligence m ine artists' work
just so that we can use ridiculous am ounts of water so that som e stoner can go "what if Leonardo DaVinci painted Leonardo the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle?" 
Let hum ans be hum ans and robots be robots. We do not NEED this and we do not benefit from  this.
