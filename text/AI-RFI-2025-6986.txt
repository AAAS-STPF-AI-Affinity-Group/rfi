General Comment
AI usage art legitim izes and enables large-scale artistic theft because these m odels are literally built on collections of data that appropriate
the work of professional artists without their consent, credit, or com pensation. The AI com panies trained their m odels on copyrighted
works, scraping enorm ous caches of art under the spurious guise of "fair use," while being very clearly in contravention of intellectual
property rights and ethical creative practice. These algorithm s of AI do not produce the best way; they m erely re-m ix and regurgitate what
has already been done, acting as high-end plagiarism  devices that com m odify borrowed art for corporate profits. By allowing such m ass
com m ercialization, governm ents are party to the undervaluing of artistic professions, disenfranchising artists of control over their own work
while em powering a torrent of derivative, m achine-generated content that underm ines both creative integrity and the sustainability of the
arts. If left unchecked, this technology exploitation will only continue to devalue hum an artistry, reducing it to grist for profit-driven
algorithm s that aim  to enrich tech conglom erates at the expense of creators them selves.
