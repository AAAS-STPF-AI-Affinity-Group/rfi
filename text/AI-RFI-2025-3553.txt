General Comment
AI has no place in the future of the US and its hard-working citizens. It steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican entertainer and artist. AI
dam ages our environm ent, jeopardizing Am erican futures on m ultiple fronts. AI is overhyped, unwanted, and constantly loses m oney while
providing no benefits to the Am erican public or those who would seek to protect us. AI is a dangerous tool that could do irreparable
dam age to Am erican futures.
