General Comment
I am  deeply disturbed by the idea of allowing Open AI or any other AI com pany to circum vent copyright, effectively looting the cultural
heritage of this country so som e AI com pany can get rich training software to copy the works of others.
I feel that this action plan is m oving in the wrong direction, hurting our artists and m usicians and other creatives. Generative AI sim ply has
not produced anything of value; it would need to offer us far m ore to actually justify any action such as the above Action Plan suggests.
