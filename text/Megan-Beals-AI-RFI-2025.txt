To whom it may concern,
Please do not allow a private company to assume everything on the internet is fair use to train
its large language models and other ai programs. This is a gross overstep of privacy, all for amanufactured "space race" that only exists to strip mine the internet and put the profits in thehands of the few. Artists, writers, regular people are already squeezed so far. We don't havemuch but our ideas. This plan to remove the few protections we have against our intellectualproperty being gobbled up by big tech will not protect the people of this country. Thank youfor hearing me.-Megan Lee Beals
