Sydney Shields,  
My name is Sydney Shields and I am a member of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth 
High S chool. I completed a semester course on AI and Ethics and studied the impacts of 
Generative AI on elementary schools. EO 14179 will be a mix of improvement and disruption. Deregulation of AI would benefit elementary teachers as AI is a great tool for various aspects of their day. However, AI is a harmful tool for elementary-aged students. Education policies should be based on teaching students how to properly use AI and limiting student access in Elementary schools. Students should not have access to AI independently without being monitored by an adult. In Elementary schools, children learn problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Access and abuse of AI can hinder the development of these skills. In addition, kindergarten to second-grade students donâ€™t always understand that AI is not a person. A study showed that younger children depicted their at -home smart speakers as having faces and emotions. In conclusion, EO 
14179 will be somewhat of an improvement to elementary schools, but there needs to be a policy in place that will ensure proper teaching and containment of access to AI in elementary schools.
