General Comment
I do not believe that if AI m ust resort to these efforts, it's worth having. AI m ust be able to find alternative m ethods of training and
producing answers. Either purchase training m aterials legitim ately, or only use data in the public dom ain.
Do not give AI unfettered access to the intellectual product of Am erican Citizens. It will ultim ately destroy the livelihoods of artists and
inventors, hurting the arts and STEM sectors.
