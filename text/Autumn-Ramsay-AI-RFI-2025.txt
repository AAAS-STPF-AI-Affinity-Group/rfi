Safeguards for privacy must be top priority. We've had enough of the police state, surveillance and 
invasion of privacy. AI has to be programmed correctly, without bias. Case in point: Prescription 
Drug Monitoring Programs. This was sold as "for your safet y", just like The Patriot Act was. Instead, 
we have federal and state law enforcement combing through prescription data to look for Crimes. 
This is Soviet -style and un -American! Not to mention it is a violation of US 42 SS 1395, ignores 
SCOTUS 2022 9 -0 decision (Ruan) and leads to unconstitutional asset seizure. Guilty until proven 
innocent, which is nearly impossible with a nearly 99% conviction rate. There is no reason for this 
and it has taken away patient and doctor autonomy. Jeff Sessions and the "red flags" are harming 
people. Something as simple as paying cash for a doctor visit can trigger a "red flag". Also, distance 
to a provider -which is absurd because rural patients and anyone who chooses a provider that is 
more than 25 miles from their home is fl agged. All of these draconian, authoritarian provisions need 
removed. People in hospice are dying in agony. This has gone too far and is a primary example of 
how AI can destroy lives, especially in the name of "safety". We do not need government 
babysitte rs.
