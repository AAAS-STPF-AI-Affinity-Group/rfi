General Comment
My nam e is Ethan Fronk. I am  a high school sophom ore living in Texas.
This action is very disturbing to m e. I see the use of AI by m y peers to cheat on tests and cheat out of their responsibilities, harm ing their
education.
this bill will encourage the use of AI in places previously not used. More im portantly to m e, AI com panies having less restricted access to
data threatens the rights of Artists and Personalities online and in person. 
AI is a great tool for furthering society, but the breaking down of regulations does not m ean better, m ore advanced AI m odels, and I
believe this action will m ake AI m odels m ore harm ful to the public. 
The reason I believe this deregulation presents a danger is in the violation of personsâ€™ privacy and property. 
If AI is allowed to train on copyrighted m aterial, I believe the copyright has been violated. If reproducing a copyrighted work for profit is
to be illegal, so should AI m odels using protected works to generate random  averages of the m aterial for their own profit. 
I believe this action plan will further the use of AI m odels by wrongdoers to harm  other people and public figures. Without further
regulation, AI can be used to lie about what an individual has said or done. I do not wish to grow up or live in a country that accepts this.
There m ust be protection against these things, and sim ply allowing AI to be used however it pleases; Will not facilitate a better, safer, and
healthier Am erica for her citizens and the world.
