General Comment
Artificial intelligence needs to be regulated in every way, from  how it is developed to how it is deployed. Ai needs to be restricted on how
it is trained, especially generative ai, and restricted to only people who have consented to having their works used in this detrim ental
m anner. As som eone who m akes their living off of their art, I do not want m y livelyhood fed into a m achine for anyone to use and m ake
artwork that looks like m ine but isn't. As for deploym ent, The ultra-wealthy are using generative ai's in ways that are pushing artists out of
their jobs. This is of m assive concern to m e as it is only a m atter of tim e until this "technology" m akes it over to m y artistic field.
The security of these "system s" is also very concerning as I know that they are also used in situations that handle very sensitive inform ation,
and I know that these system s are easily hacked from  all directions, especially from  the inside by the user, prom pting it using chains of
questions that ultim ately allow the user to bypass internal blocks and get answers that they want. I also know thanks to the news, that
these system s are also easy to hack into from  the outside by hackers.
