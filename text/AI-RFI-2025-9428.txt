General Comment
AI threatens the ability of our kids and grandkids to develop their critical thinking skills. Rejecting fair com pensation for the actual creators
of this content is a disservice to our econom y and our fellow citizens, and granting these technologies the protection of the governm ent
endangers the future of the Am erican econom y and our culture as a nation. I strongly oppose this proposal.
