General Comment
I see AI as an overhyped product sim ilar to what Silicon Valley talked about with VR and the Metaverse, all failures in their own right as
they try to get m ore investm ent through hype and false prom ises. Too m uch m oney has been put into a product that can only generate bad
art and worse personal assistants. Chinese com panies can m ake a cheaper AI that operates at the sam e, or even better, level than
Am erican ones. There can be som e good for AI in the scientific sector, but since OpenAI and other businesses focus on using it for the
m ost ridiculous products and even dystopian ideas, AI needs to be restricted for the public good. OpenAI and other AI tech com panies
have constantly stole copyrighted m aterials and flouting copyright law to fuel their own profits. Even then, as shown with various studies,
AI will becom e less intelligent as they scrape m ore and m ore inform ation from  other AI products, therefore m aking the whole ordeal
pointless. As a citizen, I cannot agree with such request for these reasons alone.
