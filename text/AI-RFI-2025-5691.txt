General Comment
The notion that AI should not be bound by copyright laws the sam e way that I, a real person m ade if flesh, am  is nothing short of insulting.
If allowed to run ram pant it will not only fill our culture with endless slop m ade by an unfeeling m achine with no soul but it will also harm
our hardworking artists. Am erican art is one of the m any positives that our country has to offer and to strip that away in favor of Machine
generated fever dream s would be nothing short of foolish.
