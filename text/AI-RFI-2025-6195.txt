RE: Request for Information on the Development of an Arti ﬁcial Intelligence (AI) 
Action Plan 
Dear Mr. D’Souza, 
On behalf of the AI Salon (the Salon), a community of more than 3,000 AI optimists 
collaboratively exploring the power of generative AI, I am writing in response to the 
National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Request for Information on the Development of 
an Arti ﬁcial Intelligence Action Plan. At the Salon, we are committed to ensuring 
that arti ﬁcial intelligence (AI) is developed and deployed in a way that promotes 
ethical integrity, social responsibility, and inclusive governance. AI has the 
transformative potential to drive positive change in the world, so we ask that you 
consider our recommendations to ensure that AI is guided by responsible principles 
and practices.  
Ensuring fairness, transparency, and societal good  
Among our core values, AI Salon’s members are invested in using AI for societal good. 
In December 2023, the Salon hosted #GPT4Good, a 24–hour collaboration that 
produced 150 custom chatbots for non-proﬁt organizations.  
To that end, we advocate for AI systems free from harmful biases and designed to be 
transparent and accountable. AI should be developed with fairness in mind, ensuring 
that it beneﬁts all people, regardless of background, identity, or circumstance. As the 
NSF and the Trump Administration consider AI regulation, we urge you to support 
policies that promote the use of AI for societal good—whether in healthcare, 
education, or environmental sustainability— that balance both holding bad actors 
accountable and encouraging innovation. 


Promoting a collaborative AI regulatory framework  
As mindful optimists, the Salon is invested in fostering an environment where AI can 
ﬂourish safely. We support thoughtful regulation that promotes AI development and 
adoption by small enterprises and addresses AI risks. We urge the Administration to 
include small enterprises and diverse founders in all policy discussions to ensure 
guidelines that adequately promote responsible AI development and deployment 
across all players.  
Additionally, the Salon supports developing national standards that govern AI's 
ethical deployment. In 2024, over 700 AI bills were introduced in state legislatures, 
and 2025 is expected to supersede that number. These bills are rarely uniform in their 
deﬁnitions and requirements, creating a worrisome patchwork of complex and 
burdensome requirements. Our members’ innovative work is seldom limited to the 
boundaries of one state, and this patchwork of regulations would particularly affect 
small founders who do not have the ﬁnancial and staf ﬁng resources to comply. To 
that end, we recommend that the Administration collaborate with the startup 
community and the public sector to harmonize national AI standards and develop 
safety practices.  
Protecting personal data and safeguarding security  
Data privacy and security are paramount in the age of AI. We advocate for policies 
that ensure AI systems handle personal data with the utmost care, with clear rules 
on data ownership and consent. Stronger protections are needed to guard against 
AI-driven cyberattacks and misinformation. We recommend that the Administration 
address these concerns through a national policy framework to help consumers 
better understand their rights and support comprehensive AI deployment.  
Balancing creativity and innovation  
As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, we must address the ownership 
and copyright implications for creators and developers. We support fair intellectual 
property laws that balance the rights of traditional artists, content creators, and AI 
developers. Additionally, we advocate for updating patent laws to reﬂect the role of 
AI in innovation while ensuring that the process remains open and accessible to all. 
Preparing workers for an AI-driven future  
The rise of AI brings both opportunity and challenge. AI literacy is crucial for 
everyone—from policymakers to everyday citizens. We advocate for expanding AI 
education at all levels of society, from introductory courses to advanced training for 
professionals. Additionally, we believe that companies must take corporate 
responsibility for ensuring their employees understand AI's technical and ethical 
aspects, fostering a workforce that can make informed, ethical decisions. 


To ensure workers have the tools to succeed in new AI-enhanced roles, we urge the 
Administration to invest in reskilling initiatives, workforce transition plans, and 
educational programming to prepare students for future workforce needs.  
Enhancing democratic processes with AI tools  
We see AI as a powerful tool to improve governance. We support the use of 
AI-assisted governance to optimize policy design, resource allocation, and public 
health responses. However, this should be done transparently and in a way that 
promotes public participation. We recommend that the Administration study how AI 
can be used to enhance public consultation models, allowing citizens to engage 
meaningfully in policy development while safeguarding privacy and fairness. 
Greening AI for a sustainable future  
AI can contribute to and help mitigate the environmental impact of technological 
development. We recommend that the Administration support policies that address 
large AI models' carbon footprint and encourage energy-efﬁcient AI development 
practices. Additionally, we support the use of AI in tackling climate change, from 
optimizing energy use to predicting and mitigating environmental risks, ensuring 
that AI becomes a tool for sustainability. 
Ensuring AI systems are safe and bene ﬁcial 
As AI becomes more complex and autonomous, we must ensure that it remains safe 
and aligned with human values. We advocate for policies that ensure robust AI 
design, preventing harmful behaviors and ensuring systems act as intended. We also 
support policies that promote human-AI collaboration, ensuring that AI augments 
human decision-making and does not replace it, fostering a future where AI 
enhances human capabilities rather than undermines them. 
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this request for comments and we ask 
that you please consider our recommendations. We welcome the opportunity to 
further this conversation, so please feel free to reach out to Kathy Orellana at 
 if you have any questions.
