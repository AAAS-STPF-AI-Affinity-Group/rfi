General Comment
The public has a right to privacy; people and businesses have a right to protect their copyright. The developm ent of AI does not override
the fundam ental rights and the governm ent needs to protect its citizens. Instead of loosening restrictions, the governm ent should investigate
how AIs have ingested protected data.
