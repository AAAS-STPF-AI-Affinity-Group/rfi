My name is Megan Monti and I am a member of the graduating class 2025 at Avonworth High 
School. I have completed a semester course on AI and Ethics and studied the impacts of Generative AI on diagnosis and treatment in the medical field. EO 14179 will improve diagnosis and treatment, and policy about technical and safety standards. AI needs to be very accurate, consistent, and safe in the medical community, and if AI continues to grow and develop, it will be immensely better for the medical community. AI needs to constantly be upgrading and improving, and with this order, I believe it wi ll safely grow. In diagnosis and treatment, it is 
extremely important for accuracy, for the safety of patients and the well -being of the medical 
community.
