General Comment
As a software engineer, I do not believe that AI developm ent should be exem pted from  copyright laws. I have worked closely with AI
system s and developed AI products, and have not yet seen anywhere close to the capability or reliability that would be needed to so
revolutionize our econom y that we should underm ine the rule of law for it.
I have, however, seen the harm s that these system s have done to the Am erican workers and Am erican creators who power our econom y
and the culture that is a pace-setter for the entire world. Our copyright laws set a valuable balance to preserve the creative works of
software developers, writers, artists, and m oreâ€”AI developm ent (just like any other Am erican product developm ent) should have to
respect that balance. If AI cannot be or has not been built without infringing on on those laws and rights, that should be a m atter for the
courts to work through.
Thank you very m uch.
