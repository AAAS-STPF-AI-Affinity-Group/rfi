General Comment
AI technology should be our last priority. It costs jobs, it costs resources and it produces low quality for the consum er as a rule. AI as it is
expressed by technology com panies is a science fiction concept. AI cant innovate or even synthesize, it sim ply reproduces patterns. As it
stands, ai is used m ore often as a tool for dangerous disinform ation than it is to solve problem s. We don't need help figuring out how to
solve problem s, we need the resources to do it and AI is in direct contradiction to those efforts. The econom y is already in danger, taking
people's jobs and creating environm ental dangers in their com m unities will only lead to further long-term  unrest.
