General Comment
Allowing so-called "AI" will creatives globally, including in the United States, by devaluing the work that everyone does and m aking our
rights to our own work live perpetually in a state of flux. This will affect everyone from  individual creators to big com panies by weakening
the m arket and our workforce.
In addition, the draw on our power grid is an ecological nightm are and will result in further and further scarcity of our natural resources
and further increase the cost of living for our citizens
