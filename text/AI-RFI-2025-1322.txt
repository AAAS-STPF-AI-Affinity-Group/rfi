University of  Virginia Response to the Request for Information on the Development of an 
Artificial Intelligence Action Pla n 
The Universi ty of Virginia (UVA) welcomes the opportunity to submit a response to the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy Networking and Information Technology Research and Development National Coordination 
Office regarding the development of  an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan.   
To maintain  U.S. leadership and dominance in global AI technological advancements , an action plan should 
incorporate robust support for research and workforce training activities , to be implemented in partnership with 
American universities.  As a public research university located in Charlottesville, Virginia and founded in 1819 by 
Thomas Jefferson, UVA  is consistently top ranked nationwide and is recognized for its rigorous academic 
environment, emphasis on interdisciplinary studies, and globally recognized research  leadership in fields like 
artificial intelligence, biomedical sciences, and education.  Presently, UVA has at least 275 faculty members with AI 
expertise.  This is reflected by  the university having  over 166 active grants focused on  AI that total more  than 
$166M.  
This submission includes several recommendations  for how the United States  can further grow and  sustain 
American AI dominance.   
Recommended Actio ns to Grow and Sustain U.S. AI Dominance 
1.Grow support for development and sustain ment of  AI-ready data and testbeds  and assessment
platforms . Advances in science and technology are becoming ever more dependent on the effective
deployment of safe, reliable, and secure AI systems. With the increasing number s and types of AI systems
available,  AI-ready data and testbeds are essential to assess capabilities and optimize implementations and of
these AI systems  that the private sector is not positioned  to assess themselves.   Universities can serve this role
since they can offer impartial, transparent, and scientifically rigorous evaluations  to provide assurance that AI
systems meet security and reliability standards,  and that capabilities of new AI technologies or products are
fully understood .  This is important as it pertains to  AI technologies or products  developed by foreign
adversaries , which may pose hidden risks, such as vulnerabilities, bias, or manipulation, which could
undermine national security, privacy, and  public trust.  Further, as AI systems are becoming increasingly
complex, universities are well placed to develop and provide comprehensive , reproducible  evaluations that go
beyond the scope of private sector interests. To  enhance support for  AI-ready data and testbeds, with the goal
of ensuring that the U.S. leads in promoting secure  and r eliable systems , some recommended actions include:


•Repurpose the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Safety Institute
Consortium to leverage academic partnerships  towards AI reliability and security.    This AI Safety
Institute Consortium , which was established at NIST with strong bipartisan support in both the House
and Senate, brings together various stakeholders, including government agencies, academic
institutions, private companies, and other independent organizations, to work on creating standardized
methodologies and frameworks for assessing and ensuring the safety of AI te chnologies.   This group , in
which UVA participates, could be utilized to: rapidly scale the creation of AI reliability  to ensure that
systems meet appropriate standards before being introduced to market ; develop and promote
guidelines and best practices for AI reliability and security ; and to support collaborative work between
sectors to address identified challenges.
•Support  AI infrastructure necessary to enable cutting edge research, including the National
Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) .  Currently in pilot form, the NAIRR is a  National
Science Foundation- led partnership intended to connect U.S. researchers to computational, data,
software , model and training resources necessary to participate in fundamental and translational AI
research .  A significant focus of this work has been and should continue to be on AI  trustworthiness.
The NAIRR pilot, which was developed because of  a task force recommendation under the first Trump
Administration,  is set to expire in January of 2026.  The Administration should invest in the full NAIRR
which will enable major increases to AI innovation by expanding access to computing power andmaking AI infrastruc ture easier  to access for small companies and academic researchers.
2.Leverage academic work for  the Intelligence Community (IC) in the development and  use generative AI
technology to analyze open source and commercial  data. To advance U.S. national security  the IC requires
innovative AI tools to process the enormous amount of open- source data, with particular focus on the rapidly
growing AI achievements happening worldwide in academia.  AI tools have tremendous potential to produce
critical insights from these open- source data useful for defense analysts and decisionmakers. For example, at
UVA’s  National Security Data and Policy Institute
, researchers are working to develop tools and capabilities
required to distill vast troves of information on AI technological developments in other countries available in
conferences, workshops and journals .  This work supports the necessary comparative analysis of technologies
between nations  and enables IC security analysts  to acquire  insights from these important open- source data
and to assess possible threats to our technological leadership. The action plan should incorporate continued
funding to support AI -based tools in these contexts.
3.Leverage the pot ential of AI  research within health and biomedical sciences.  Investing in AI research
within health and biomedical sciences is essential for accelerating breakthroughs in personalized medicine,early disease detection, and treatment optimization. By leveraging AI, there is potential for the U.S. to lead the
world in unlocking  complex biological  and health  data to improve patient care, streamline healthcare systems
and ultimately advance public health outcomes.  The integration of AI in biomedical fields is critical not only forbreakthrough treatments and diagnostics  but also for improving healthcare efficiency and accessibility.
Countries like China are heavily investing in AI healthcare/bioscience innovation, with initiatives such as the
“Made in China 2025” plan, which emphasizes AI in medicine and biotechnology, as well as large -scale data
initiatives in health. An absence of U.S. investment in this area  could make the  United States more reliant on
China for innovations in AI -driven health and biosciences , which could create a significant security
vulnerability, as critical medical technologies and sensitive health data could be controlled by a foreign power


with potentially divergent interests  to ours. This could jeopardize U.S. sovereignty over its healthcare systems, 
compromise patient privacy, and create risks related to national security if adversarial nations influence 
healthcare technologies or gain access to crucial medical information.  While there ha s been interest in AI + 
health related research  in the United States, there are relatively few dedicated mechanisms to support work  
that bring together individuals with strengths in  basic bioscience, publi c health, and clinical research with 
equally strong technical capabilities in computational, analytical, and systems research  and the health agencies 
have invested comparatively less in AI -related research than physical science agencies.   Some 
recommendations to scale -up U.S. investments in this space include:  
•Strengthen and support collaborative AI institutes between NSF and the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)  to foster innovation and advance the integration of AI and biomedical
science . By facilitating collaboration between NSF and NIH, the United States  can leverage the
complementary strengths of these agencies —NSF's expertise in foundational AI research and NIH's
leadership in biomedical science—to drive the development of cutting- edge AI technologies  and
innovations . Supporting bioscience -focused  AI institutes would facilitate U.S. global leader ship in AI
innovation, promote cross -disciplinary research  while building on the successful five -year track record
of the NSF AI Institutes Program.
•Create  a Collaborative AI -Health Data Integration  Research Program  to develop advanced
methods for the integration of AI systems with diverse healthcare data and  improve health-
related outcomes for all Americans .  Most American hospitals produce large amounts of data in
multiple forms . These include bedside monitors that generate time stamped records, imaging, lab
reports, medications, clinical notes from physicians, and electronic health r ecords.  The integration of
AI systems with these different forms of health data has proved challenging because of :
(1)Lack of interoperability between the formats;
(2)Data quality issues;
(3)Need for privacy and security; and
(4)Problem complexity.
The proposed program, which could be supported by ARPA -H or the Department of Health and Human 
Services , could bring together interdisciplinary teams including basic and clinical researchers, 
computational scientists, and healthcare professionals could draw on stakeholder input from patience, 
policy makers, healthcare providers, hospital systems to support research : to develop AI -driven 
standards  and interoperability solutions ; to inform development of  data quality and security 
frameworks; and to advance computational approaches for complex problem solving that can handle 
the complexities inherent in AI- health data integration .  In addition, this research program could also 
support the  development of curriculum, c ertification programs , and  public- private partnerships to 
facilitate training of graduate students address workforce education and training needs.   
4.Harness AI- syst ems to improve educational instruction.  W ith the rapid improvements to AI technologies
and tools  over the past couple of years, there are significant research needs to enable the use of AI technologies
to achieve their full potential  to enable personalized, adaptable instruction for adults and K- 12 students .
Specifically, w hile these AI  tools  can enhance learning, they have not  fully replace d or matched the
effectiveness of skilled  human teachers. Likewise, AI tools have also not been optimized as a tool to help
improve instruction.  Some recommendations of programs the United States could consider incorporating into


its action plan , which would help give parents and local school districts more tools to help them achieve their 
goals,  include:  
•Support for research and development of multimodal AI-powered learning programs .  Current AI
systems used in education employ text -based user interfaces. To enable interactive, adaptive, and
personalized learning experiences, t here is a significant need for additional research support to
develop and expand multimodal AI-powered learning platforms .  Th ese multimodal AI systems will
enable multiple types of inputs including text, speech, drawing/images, video, and gestures.
Incorporating these multiple inputs will enhance student engagement with AI -powered learning
systems and provide more dynamic, personalized, and inclusive learning environment .  Such work
could be supported through collaborati on between the NSF and the Institut e of Education Sciences.
•AI-assisted teacher  professional development . An important approach to improving instruction
uses  AI systems to improve the skills and effectiveness of human instruction. This means using AI to
simulate different types of students to prepare instructors for the range of learning styles and needsthey will encounter in a classroom or educational environment. These AI simulations will provide a
controlled environment for teachers to practice and experiment with different instructional styles  to
find  those that can most effectively address the needs of their students. These simulations will also
support improved understanding and planning for classroom dynamics and behavioral management.
In addition, AI could also be utilized to develop predictive models that could identify “at risk” students.
5.Leverage univers ities to prioritize development of the future AI workforce . To maintain and strengthen
the U.S.'s leadership in AI, it is critical to address the shortage of skilled professionals capable of navigating thecomplexities of AI integration into other sectors . Universities are well- positioned to train the next generation of
experts, but they need robust federal support to enhance curricula, offer research opportunities, and facilitateprofessional development. By investing in these areas, the U.S. can ensure that it remains competitive in AIinnovation and continues to develop solutions that improve healthcare, security, and economic outcomes.
Specific recommendations include:
•Support Graduate Fellowships and Research Programs . Expand funding for graduate fellowships
that incorporate AI , such as NSF’s Research Traineeships (NRT), Graduate Research Fellowships (GRF),
and CAREER awards , the Department of Energy’s Computational Science Graduate Fellowship program,
the NIH National Research Service Award (NRSA) , and the Department of Education Graduate
Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) Program. These initiatives are essential for training the
next generation of researchers and computational scientists, ensuring a steady pipeline of talent
equipped to tackle AI challenges across sectors.
•Promote Undergraduate Curriculum Integration . Encourage the integration of AI, machine learning,
and data science into undergraduate STEM curricula. This will provide students with a solid foundationin the mathematical principles behind AI, as well as practical experience in data science and modelin g,
ensuring they are well -prepared for careers in AI and related fields.
•Foster Public -Private Partnerships for Workforce Development . Establish partnerships between
universities, industry leaders, and federal agencies to create internship programs and research
opportunities that expose students to real -world AI challenges. These programs could focus on
healthcare, national security, and defense- related AI applications, providing students with valuable
hands -on experience in federal research environments and private industry.


•Enhance Professional Development Opportunities .  Provide continuous education and training for
professionals already in the workforce, particularly healthcare providers, data scientists, and IT
specialists. Universities should be supported in offering continuing education programs that focus onemerging  AI technologies, ensuring that the existing workforce remains at the forefront of AI
advancements.
