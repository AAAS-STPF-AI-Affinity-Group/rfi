General Comment
As a software developer and content creator, m y m ain concerns are the following:
1. Conserving traditional art form s and preventing AI from  iterating on artists' work without their explicit consent. Websites should not be
able to suddenly start selling artists' im ages to m achines in order to create the next m illion-dollar m ovie.
2. Ensuring any AI created lessens its im pact on our electric and other resources. I'm  personally fine with AI, but current AI m odels are
extrem ely wasteful. The public cares, and m any will boycott AI if it's not im proving on its efficiency. Being efficient with resources was
required to get us to the m oon; being efficient will determ ine the long-term  im pact of any governm ental finances related to AI.
As long as those two principles are followed, I can personally support funding AI program s.
