General Comment
A large part of what m akes our country great is the conglom eration of incredibly intelligent and creative m inds that m ake up the Am erican
people. Those people, who will have no confidence in engaging those m inds when everything they create will be stolen from  them
wholesale to be chopped up and regurgitated by an algorithm ic program ; a program  that not only cannot operate properly without that
theft, but also requires huge am ounts of energy that places a great strain on our national natural resources. 
Unchecked AI developm ent is fundam entally at odds with the health and success of the Am erican people. 
Please respect and encourage the ingenuity and creative individuality of Am erican Citizens that m ake this country great and the global
m edia leader that it is. Do not allow the protections for those citizens to be underm ined for the m onetary gains of a few.
Thank you.
