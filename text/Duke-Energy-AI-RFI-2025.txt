1 Comments from Duke Energy  
in Response to the Networking and Information Technology Research 
and Development National Coordination Office’s  
Request for Information on the Development of an  
Artificial Intelligence Action Plan  
March 15, 20251 
Executive Summary  
Duke Energy  Corporation (“Duke Energy” or the “Company”)  appreciates the opportunity 
to submit comments to the United States Office of Science and Technology Policy (“OSTP”) to 
support President Trump ’s direction for his administratio n to develop the  Artificial Intelligence 
(“AI”) Action Plan to advance America ’s AI dominance .2  Recognizing that reliable and abundant 
energy is the bedrock upon which American AI innovation, deployment, and dominance will be 
built, Duke Energy  outlines seven energy-related priorities that will help the United States meet 
its new, AI -driven data center electric load demands, thereby enabling the country to enhance its 
economic strength , buttress its national security objectives , and support the American people . 
Duke Energy provides these comments based on its over 100 -year history of providing the 
energy that has driven economic growth and prosperity for the regions and people it serves.  As a 
Fortune 150 company headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., Duke Energy is one of America’s largest 
energy holding companies. The Company’s electric utilities serve 8.4 million customers in North 
1 Comments submitted electronically to  Office of Science and Technology Policy . 
2 On January 23, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14179 (Removing Barriers to American Leadership 
in Artificial Intelligence), which declared that it is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s 
global AI dominance to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.  Executive 
Order 14179 also directed the development of an AI Action Plan (“AI Plan”) designed t o achieve policy goals.  On 
February 6, 2025, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development National Coordination 
Office published a Request for Information on behalf of the OSTP requesting input from the public, including private 
sector organizations, on priority actions that should be included in the AI Plan.  This document is approved for public dissemination. The document 
contains no business -proprietary or confidential information. Document 
contents may be reused by the government in developing the AI Action 
Plan and associated documents without attribution .

 Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, and collectively own 
approximately 54,800 megawatts of energy capacity. Its natural gas utilities serve 1.7 million 
customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky.  
 
Working with our datacenter/AI customers on innovative partnerships, state legislatures 
and regulatory commissions on AI and growth supportive policy, supply chain partners and 
community and technical colleges on workforce development (just to name a few), Duke Energy 
is advancing on multiple fronts to rise to the call around AI dominance.  
Duke Energy is working on innovative, tailored solutions to meet growing, large -scale 
energy needs in its service areas. For example, t o help encourage critical investments necessary 
for new large loads while protecting existing customers, our contracts include enhanced 
performance and credit provisions such as security for interconnection costs, elevated minimum 
bills, and required long -term contracts with termination penalties – all of which help advance 
critical infrastructure upgrades while reducing ris k if loads fail to materialize as expected. This 
work is aligned with the Trump Administration ’s energy priorities, as well as its priority  to retain 
America’s  place as a global leader in AI technology  and development . Duke Energy’s efforts  
include meeting the high standards for grid security and resilience, as well as protecting  against 
both physical and cyberattacks and natural disasters.  
Duke Energy’s customer -centric approach features programs that are evolving and 
maturing to match the new dynamic needs of our customers and the grid. Duke Energy announced 
signed customer agreements in the third quarter of last year to connect two gigawatts of new data 
centers and anticipates load growth to begin accelerating.  The Company is ready, willing,  and 
able to power these data centers and meet this unprecedented load growth as a long -standing 
provider of reliable  electric services to high load factor customers across many industries .  As a 
regulated utility , Duke Energy ensures that the Company’s actions both add value for all customers 
connected to the grid  while ensuring safe, affordable and reliable energy .  
Duke Energy not only  has a proven record of planning, developing, and operating energy 
infrastructure in a safe and reliab le manner , but also one of partnering with the federal government, 


3 U.S. military, technology companies, and other large customers to meet customers’ evolving needs 
and achieving mutually beneficial outcomes.  Indeed, dating back to 1952 when the Company  
joined ownership of the Ohio Valley Electric Cooperative with the federal government and other 
investor-owned utilities in the Ohio River Valley area to support the large electric load needed for 
uranium enrichment facilities then under construction by the Atomic Energy Commission, Duke 
Energy has supported initiatives that  helped implement  the vital policy goals of the United States 
and the federal government. Furthermore, Duke Energy  serves significant military installation s 
with peak demand exceeding  200 megawatts , including meeting their specific energy security 
needs with on -site generation  (e.g., innovative microgrid solution)  and secur e grid access .    
   Given this demonstrated track record  of supporting national priorities , the Company is  
driven to meet the nation ’s most pressing challenges, including the rapid deployment of energy 
solutions for the AI sector.   
Sustaining and enhancing the United States’ global AI dominance will require meeting the 
extraordinary growth in energy demand driven  in good measure  by AI.  To meet the President’s 
goals, the AI Plan should also include economic development initiatives  that encourage and 
streamline private investment in energy infrastructure  that can support AI .   
Duke Energy support s President Trump ’s goal of meeting AI’s massive energy 
requirements while maintaining reliability and affordability for customers.  Specifically, Duke 
Energy is focused on accelerating the deployment of new electric generation capacity  and related 
infrastructure , ensuring grid stability, and delivering cost -effective, modern, and resilient  energy 
solutions to power the AI revolution.   By 2030, Duke Energy plans to increase our generation 
capacity by nearly 12.5 gigawatts – enough to power approximately 10 million average homes.  
This increase is equivalent to adding more than 20% of our current generating fleet capacity in the 
next five years. 
Expediting Critical Energy Infrastructure is Essential to AI Leadership  
Duke Energy  applauds President Trump’s recognition that energy dominance and 
affordability are fundamental not only to America’s AI leadership , but vital for promoting national 


4 security, good paying jobs, and the quality of life for the American people.  R ecently signed 
Executive Orders  (“EO”), including EO  14156 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency ) (“EO 
DNEE”)3 and 14154 (Unleashing American Energy ) (“EO UAE ”),4 together with EO 14179,  
highlight the President’s  commitment to securing America ’s energy future.   In declaring a national 
energy emergency, EO DNEE identifies energy “transportation” and “generation capacity” as 
“inadequate,” and further identifies “inadequate energy supply and infrastructure,” and 
“insufficient energy production . . . and generation,” as the basis of the en ergy emergency .5  These 
three EOs underscore the President’s understanding that  energy dominance , modern energy 
infrastructure, energy security, and America’s AI leadership  are interconnected .  The EOs also 
establish the predicate for triggering specific emergency authorities found in federal statutes.   
Below, Duke Energy outlines  seven priority areas  that can help support and  expedite the 
development  of energy infrastructure  necessary to meet the energy demands needed to achieve the 
President’s  goal of American AI dominance , thereby enabling the country to promote its economic 
growth and prosperity strengthen  national security .  
Policy Recommendations for Enabling Energy Abundance to 
Foster American AI Dominance  
1.Promote American -Made Supplies of Critical Components  to Strengthen the Energy
Generation Supply Chain
Duke Energy has complete faith in our domestic suppliers and their responsiveness to this 
growing market.  However, policy can further support robust and resilient supply chains, including 
domestic manufacturing. The AI Plan should consider supporting  supplies and services necessary 
to build power generation facilities and associated infrastructure  to support AI -driven data centers  
developments . Current lead times for key components in the energy supply chain can range from 
two to three  years (e.g., 24 months for power transformers 48 months for high voltage circuit 
breakers, and 36 months for gas turbines).  There are growing demands for steel, aluminum, and

 many additional  components that are needed to construct power plants, transmission lines, natural 
gas pipelines to support natural gas generation facilities, and grid operating systems.  The 
availability of skilled workers, such as welders, electricians and engineers, is also constrained.  
  Delays or the inability to obtain supplies and services could severely challenge the ability 
of the energy sector to meet AI’s projected power demands. Increasing project certainty through 
permitting and other reforms will send strong signals to suppliers. Supporting access to supplies 
and services necessary to build power generation facilities and associated infrastructure  would also 
help address this need and help reduce risks relating to construction of new generating resources.   
The Defense Production Act (“DPA”)6 is a possible policy tool to assist energy developers 
gain access to the supplies and services needed to meet AI’s energy demands in a timely manner. 
The DPA provides broad authority for the President to prioritize the performance of contracts and 
allocation of supplies to advance such actions as the building of generation facilities and natural 
gas pipelines (e.g. steel, generators, etc.).  Specifically, § 101(c) of the DPA permits the President 
to order priority performance of contracts or allocation of supplies “to maximize domestic energy 
supplies” and make determinations that such “materials, services, and facilities” are “scarce, 
critical, and essential . . . to construct or maintain energy facilities[.]”7  Therefore, the AI Plan 
should consider using the DPA to increase energy developers’ access to supplies and services 
necessary to build power generation facilities and the construction of associated infrastructure and 
to support the goal of  “build it in America.”  
2. Expedite Siting and Permitting for Critical Energy Infrastructure While Protecting the 
Environment  
The Company belie ves Americans can have abundant, modern, affordable, reliable , and 
resilient energy in support of AI dominance, while also ensuring a healthy environment with clean 
air and clean water  and protecting endangered species .  To achieve these goals , however, efficient, 
expedited and certain environmental permitting is essential.  Recognizing these challenges, the 
 
6 50 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq.   
7 50 U.S.C. § 4511(c).  


6 President’s EOs DNEE and UA E direct federal agencies to streamline environmental permitting  
and to use existing authorities to expedite the construction  of energy infrastructure.8  As the AI 
Plan is developed, a prudent way to promote energy infrastructure development while also 
protecting the environment is to apply a risk -informed balancing approach.   Too often , federal 
regulators engage in a “no -risk” approach to reviewing permit applications , which is not 
necessarily consistent with  law.  Instead, federal agencies should be encouraged to make sound, 
informed decisions by measuring the likelihood of the ri sk and the costs to mitigate such risk.   
Timely permit issuance through final agency approvals is also essential to meet this 
moment.  Whether it involves building a new power generation facility, a n electric transmission 
line, or a natural gas pipeline to support power generation, obtaining the necessary permits 
expeditiously, and with certainty, under, among many other statutes,  the Clean Water Act 
(“CWA”),9 the Clean Air Act (“CAA”),10 and the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”),11 is 
unreasonably difficult.  The delays may be caused by interagency disputes and lack of proper 
coordination  or legal challenges against the issuing agenc ies.   
In order to facilitate the execution of projects that support domestic AI development, t he 
Company appreciates EO DNEE’s direction to agencies to use existing emergency authorities to 
grant clean water permits and to require administrative consideration to employ potential 
nationwide permits under the CWA and other statutes administered by the Army Corps of 
Engineers.12  The Company  also appreciates EO DNEE’s acknowledgement of the need to 
expedite ESA permits through the so -called “God Squad,” while also protecting endangered 
species.13   
The process involved to conduct and then finalize  an environmental review , led by a federal 
agency, potentially with several “cooperating agencies ,” under the National Environmental Policy 
8 EO DNEE §§ 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; EO UAE §§ 3, 5, and 6.  
9 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. 
10 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq. 
11 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq. 
12 EO DNEE § 4.  
13 EO DNEE § 5 and 6.  It is noteworthy that the ESA already contains provisions for exemptions based on “undue 
economic hardship,” 16 U.S.C. § 1539.  


7 Act (“NEPA”)14 can take years , which does not include additional time to sort through seemingly 
inevitable legal challenges .  We appreciate the White House Council on Environmental Quality ’s 
recent memorandum to federal agencies to “revise or establish their NEPA implement ing 
procedures (or establish such procedures if they do not yet have any) to expedite permitting 
approvals... .”  Nonetheless, due to recent court decisions and pending legal cases, t here remains 
uncertainty as to how the agencies will manage NEPA reviews  and until resolved , could mean 
further delays.15  Therefore, the Company urges the Administration to develop additional guidance 
for agency compliance with NEPA.  
EO UAE’s directive to facilitate energy “production” on federal lands could also facilitate 
accelerated deployment of generation facilities.16  Although state regulatory commissions 
typically approve c ertificates for new utility generation facilities  on non-federal land , EO DNEE 
directs the executive branch to exercise its “siting” authorities with respect to “federal lands ” and 
to access the use of federal eminent domain and submit recommendations to the President.17  Duke 
Energy has a strong track record  and history  of serving federal facilities  throughout our 
jurisdictions.  
It is likely some of the new generating facilities that will power AI across the nation will 
be powered by natural gas, which means there will be a need for additional natural gas pipelines 
to deliver the gas to those facilities.  Federal authorizations for interstate n atural gas pipeline s fall 
within the Natural Gas Act (“ NGA”)18 and are administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (“FERC”).  Given that § 7 of the NGA already provides eminent domain authority 
for holders of NGA certificates,19 the AI Plan should consider policies that would support and 
facilitate the targeted and reasonable use of authorit ies to construct necessary  new and incremental 
14 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq. 
15 The NEPA process is in doubt because of the recent decision by in  Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation 
Administration , No. 23-1067 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 12, 2024); den. en banc., where the court held that the Council on 
Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) did not have the authority to issue NEPA regulations. President Trump’s EO UAE 
directs the CEQ to propose rescinding the NEPA regulations.  
16 EO UAE § 2; though not defined in EO UAE, “production” is defined in EO DNEE § 8.  
17 EO DNEE § 2.  
18 15 U.S.C. § 717 et seq. 
19 15 U.S.C. § 717f.  


8 facilities that would support the development of natural gas -fired dispatchable generation to 
support AI -driven data center development .  Another potential option for further consideration is 
that, pursuant to  the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”),20 the President can declare a natural gas 
supply emergency and may issue an order to “ require any pipeline to transport natural gas, and to 
construct and operate such facilities for the transportation of natural gas , as he determines 
necessary” to carry out executive rules or orders in place during a natural gas supply emergency.21  
These are initial examples of statutory authority granted to the President to ensure the construction 
and operation of natural gas facilities under national emergency circumstances.  
Therefore, the Company supports the AI Plan in identifying ways to expedite 
environmental permitting  and siting  for critical energy infrastructure to support AI, while also 
protecting the environment.   
3.Fast Track Grid Interconnection for New Generation Accompanying Large Loads
To enable sufficient generation production to meet the electricity demand of AI  
technologies , the AI Plan should include a process to fast track the interconnection of new 
generation facilities necessary to support  AI data centers.  As is well documented, the 
interconnection queues for new generation are combined  with projects that may or may not be 
built and may not be the type of resources needed to meet the energy demands and load profiles 
of AI data centers.  
Expedited interconnection can be accomplished through  § 202(c) of the Federal Power Act 
(“FPA”), which states that the U.S. Department of Energy (“USDOE”) can order the “temporary” 
connection of facilities for the generation and transmission of electricity to meet the “public 
interest.”22  Such orders  that “may result in a conflict with a requirement of any Federal, State, or 
local environmental law or regulation” must be renewed every 90 days.  FPA § 202(c) is an 
20 15 U.S.C. § 3301  et seq. 
21 15 USC § 3362(c) (emphasis added).  
22 16 U.S.C. § 824a(c). See also, 10 C.F.R. Part 205, § 205.371 Definition of emergency.  


9 effective tool with which  the industry is already familiar , as USDOE regularly exercises this 
authority.  
4.Focus on Grid Stability
The AI Plan should include a directive for AI data center developers to w ork with
generation, transmission, and distribution asset  owners to ensure that  (1) new data centers are built 
in locations that do not over burden the electric grid, and  (2) new grid infrastructure necessary to 
maintain the reliability of the system is identified and constructed along with the respective AI 
data center .  Our Company has been strongly interlinked with the communities we serve for many 
years, including more than a century in some locations. We work closely with them to understand 
and support their changing needs  and have a long history of serving communities with excellence 
and well-established infrastructure to ensure reliable, 24/7 energy service. This directive should 
also consider i ncentivizing AI data center  construction  in areas with existing generation  resources 
and existing infrastructure so that utilities can leverage previous facility investments to support AI 
development.  Such a directive would help to ensure the availability of reliable and economic 
power for both AI technologies and other types of consumers.  
5.Unlock Grid Flexibility Through Data Center Demand Response
The AI Plan should consider incentives for the development and deployment of energy -
efficient AI data center technologies, such as advanced cooling systems and intelligent power 
management , as well as other strategies for enhancing data center flexibility.   Development and 
deployment of such technology would help lessen the demands that AI development and 
implementation  will impose on the nation’s energy infrastructure which will, in turn, facilitate its 
successful integration .   
 The AI plan should seek to allow additional pathways for flexible load response so as to 
alleviate potential shortages during peak demand periods on the grid. Supporting the expansion of 
demand-side flexibility through technological advancements in batter y storage, nuclear generation 
and renewables, along with expanded fuel options for backup facilities, could help accelerate the 
onboarding of AI data centers, while also ensuring reliability for all customers.  Supporting  the 


10 expansion of demand-side flexibility through technolog ical advancements  in battery  storage, 
nuclear generation  and renewables, along with expanded fuel options  for backup facilities, will 
undoubtedly accelerate  the onboarding of AI data centers , while also ensuring reliability  for all 
customers . 
6.Unleash Private Investment in Energy Infrastructure
The AI Plan should implement economic  development drivers that encourage and
streamline private investment in energy infrastructure.   Investments in energy infrastructure are 
undoubtedly capital-intensive endeavors  that will serve customers and communities for decades. 
Financing this critical infrastructure requires predictable cost recovery frameworks , including tax 
policy, which maintain customer affordability while providing the stability upon which utility 
sector investors have grown accustomed to depend ing.  Such tax policies  not only help support 
investment in capital intensive infrastructure, but they can also help mitigate impacts on customers.  
For example, Duke Energy customers will receive – dollar-for-dollar - more than half a billion 
dollars in nuclear production credits in 2024, which flow back to customers quickly through an 
important accelerator for nuclear projects c alled transferability.  This pairing of the nuclear PTC 
and transferability  is essential  to finance the next generation of nuclear energy.  
The option of new  full-scale or small modular  nuclear power development requires 
significant upfront capital, with long development and regulatory timelines.  In addition to 
exploring ways to streamline the regulatory process, the federal government should also explore 
facilitating financial mechanisms  for both full -scale and small modular reactors , such as loan 
guarantees, cost overrun insurance for early movers, reinforce long -term market structures, and 
overall improve the economic viability of new nuclear projects and attract private investment.  
Over time, policies like these would help nuclear power transition from reliance on federal support 
to a self-sustaining, market -driven energy source that can provide reliable, carbon -free electricity 
for AI data centers and the broader grid.  
7.Energy Grid Defense


11 The United States’ electric grid is a critical national security asset upon which enhancement 
of the United States’ position as a global leader will depend.   Accordingly, the AI Plan should 
deploy AI defense systems to protect the electric grid from cyber and physical attacks at a level 
commensurate with the electric grid’s integral importance to the United States’s national security . 
The AI defense system requirements and solutions should be established  in tight partnership and 
collaboration with the critical infrastructure providers to ensure protection of the electric grid 
without compromising utilities’ ability to effectively secure the electric grid.   
DPA § 106 designates “energy “as a strategic and critical material,23 and DPA § 702’s 
definition of “national defense” includes programs for “energy production and construction.”24  
Therefore, the AI Plan should consider the deployment of the full scope of AI capabilities to protect , 
to the greatest extent possible, the electric grid from adversaries that would seek to harm the United 
States.  Of course, this also means such AI will need reliable and secure energy sources.  
Conclusion  
The United States ’ ability to achieve AI dominance  is inextricably linked to its energy 
infrastructure.   Duke Energy is committed to providing the reliable , affordable,  and abundant 
energy necessary to power America’s AI revolution.   
Duke Energy thanks the President Trump for his leadership on this important issue and the 
Company thanks his Administration for providing the opportunity to submit input on the 
development of an AI Action Plan .  The Company looks forward to partnering with the Trump 
Administration with respect to the successful implementation of the EOs referenced in these 
comments, including EO  14179.
