General Comment
Hello, m y nam e is Alexandra, and I am  an artist. 
The entirety of the AI surge and the concept that these m assive com panies should be free to steal the handm ade work of countless
individuals is unlawful, cruel, and absurdity in its highest form . As an artist, I have trained and honed m y skills over years to be able to
create works on com m ission in order to pay m y bills and m ake m y livelihood. These large scale tech com panies have no right to steal the
fruits of m y labor to feed into their plagiarism  m achine in order to m ake their own profits off of m y own work. They should not be exem pt
from  the restrictions of copyright laws just because they are a corporation and I am  an individual trying to m ake a living. I am  outraged by
not only the harm  to m yself and other artists this industry had im pacted by scraping the im ages and writing that we've created to steal the
essence of hum an creativity and cram  it into a program  designed to blatantly exploit the work of skilled artisans for these com panies to
profit off of with no consequence: there is also the horrific consequence to the environm ent that these program s inflict by requiring m assive
am ounts of water while entire regions of our country are in drought. It's cruel theft of work, it's an affront to the natural resources of our
country, and it's a grave insult to artists that people feel entitled to take what we have m ade and use it for their private gain without any
form  of contract, paym ent, or consequence.
