I do not believe generative AI has any place in the future of the US. So far, generative AI has
been almost entirely used to steal the efforts of hard-working Americans to produce farinferior products at steep energy costs. It does not improve upon the work it stole from, itdistorts and diminishes it at cost to the original artist and the thief. This is not just aboutcreative works such as digital art or written works of fiction, but also of functional orinformational data such as news articles, textbooks, and source code.I believe there is a way that Generative AI can be used constructively, but, as it is currentlyimplemented, Generative AI is only harming American citizens, stealing from the many forthe profit of the few and flooding the internet with the incorrect data of a machine'smisunderstandings, all for a technology that most Americans, if not most people all over theworld, do not see as beneficial. Please do not give this dangerous technology free reign to beabused, do not allow the rampant theft from the American people to continue.
