General Comment
Copyright laws have been in place for a long tim e and have been getting tram pled on m ore and m ore over tim e, this is just another attem pt
to do so. *I do not believe this is a good thing* and allowing AI to violate it is sim ply another attem pt to m ake copyright have less
regulations yet again.
Please, for the love of god, do not let this go through! We have enough exam ples of this going poorly that trying to go around it yet again
will only end badly.
