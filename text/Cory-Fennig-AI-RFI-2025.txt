[External] AI action plan

I think it best to let Elon lead the way on this issue. I would just ask that all electricity to power  
AI and data centers be off grid self-sustaining. I do not want to see another huge spike in my  
energy prices. Itâ€™s bad enough my landscape (IN) is now covered in windmills, that send power  
to the east coast. Where is the benefit to my community for the eyesore, and constant flashing  
red lights.
Thank you for asking for community input.
