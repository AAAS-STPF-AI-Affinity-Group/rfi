General Comment
Artificial intelligence, as it stands, is good for producing a huge quantity of m ediocre inaccurate product in a short tim e as a ridiculous
energy cost, and can only do so by processing and plagiarizing existing works. Com m itting to using an inefficient and unnecessary tool is
not of benefit to this country.
