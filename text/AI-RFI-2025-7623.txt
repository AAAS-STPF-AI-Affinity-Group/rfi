General Comment
AI is not a replacem ent for hum anity. it will always attem pt to replicate, it will im itate, but it will never be true. it will never be real. it will
never be new. it will never have soul. it will never m ove anyone. it will never m ake som eone feel. it will never m ake som eone think. it will
never expand anyoneâ€™s m ind. it will never com e from  a genuine place. AI is devoid of passion. AI is devoid of art. it has nothing to offer. it
is nothing. it cannot be trusted and should not be used for any purpose. if we let it grow and grow, we will be devoid of seeing anything
real.
