General Comment
This is a blatant attem pt for large com panies to com pletely ignore copyright law, OpenAI and Google should not get a free pass to steal
the creations m illions of people worked hard on, and did NOT consent for them  to use. Personal inform ation should NOT be up for grabs
as well!!! What happens after this, an entirely separate law system  for corporations and the citizens of our country? 
An action plan should be based on innovation, not theft.
