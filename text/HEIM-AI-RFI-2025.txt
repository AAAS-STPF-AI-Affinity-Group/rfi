AI models should only be trained on content explicitly released for that purpose by it's 
creators.  We have copyrights, trademarks and licenses.  All of these serve to protect the 
labor and development of creative works, research, patents and such.  These protections 
enable people to invest their time, energy and expertise.  We have understood the 
importance of IP for ages.  It's shouldn't be thrown away simply because a new technology 
would be more fruitful if it stole the IP of creators and researchers that never consented to 
this use. AI training, as it currently exists, is based on shameless appropriation of others' intellectual 
property.  This is already having a chilling effect on those whose work has been stolen for AI 
training.  The government must create guardrails for AI technology to curb it's vorcious 
appetite to steal others' work without shame or consequence. 
Initially copyright compliant training sets could be formed from works in the public domain. 
Works protected by current copyright law could be opted in by their creators, with 
verification that works are not submitted without the true author's authorization. 
Opting out is not viable as it creates a whack-a-mole situation where limitless theft is 
allowed until it is caught.
