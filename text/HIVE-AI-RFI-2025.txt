Re: Hive’s Response to White House AI Action Plan 
Overview: Ensuring American AI Dominance Through Deepfake Detection 
The United States faces an escalating national security threat from AI-powered deepfakes. 
Adversaries—both foreign and domestic—are weaponizing AI-generated synthetic media to 
commit fraud, manipulate public opinion, impersonate government officials, evade border 
security, spread child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and undermine our institutions. To 
maintain American dominance in AI, the U.S. must lead the world in deepfake detection, 
particularly in countering threats that jeopardize border security, national defense, and broader 
public safety and financial security. Recommendations: Counter-Deepfake Priorities for the AI Action Plan 
1.Securing Borders & Immigration Systems Against Deepfake Manipulation
●Direct DHS, CBP, State Department, and the Intelligence Community to deploy
AI-driven deepfake detection to verify documents, biometric data, and border
applications, identifying fraudulent asylum claims and visa manipulations.●Require AI screening of intercepted communications to detect smugglers, traffickers,
and cartel-affiliated operations using deepfakes and forgeries to deceive authorities
and advance their plots.
2.Targeting Child Exploitation & Human Trafficking Networks
●Direct DHS, FBI, and DOJ to deploy AI-powered systems to detect AI-generated
CSAM before it proliferates on online platforms.●Encourage all social media companies to integrate AI deepfake detection APIs to
identify and eliminate synthetic CSAM at scale and explore potential penalties for
failure to leverage the technology to eliminate the threat.●Establish a federal CSAM & Trafficking AI Task Force to track deepfake exploitation
of minors and human trafficking operations and explore near-term actions to combat
the problem at speed and scale.
3.Combating Enemy Attacks on Our Networks and Institutions
●Direct ODNI, DoD, and DHS to implement real-time AI monitoring of hostile
nation-state deepfake campaigns aimed at interfering in the United States,
undermining national cybersecurity, and threatening U.S. institutions.●Broadly mandate the integration of real-time deepfake detection into U.S. Cyber
Command and Intelligence Community operations to identify and neutralize AI-driven
threats before they impact national security.
4.Preventing AI-Driven Financial & Consumer Fraud
●Mandate that the Departments of Treasury and Commerce collaborate to integrate

deepfake detection in financial services to prevent scams, identity theft, and synthetic 
media-driven fraud, including by providing support to American small businesses to 
prevent devastating financial losses. ●Direct Treasury and Secret Service to lead interagency efforts to counteract
AI-generated fraud networks linked to domestic and transnational criminal
enterprises and foreign intelligence operations.
5.Modernizing Law Enforcement & Intelligence Agencies with AI
●Require DHS, FBI, and ICE/HSI to implement real-time AI monitoring of dark web
and encrypted channels for deepfake-enabled criminal activity, including drug
trafficking, gang communications, and cyberattacks.●Expand AI deployment in counterterrorism by integrating deepfake detection in
screening processes for identifying known and suspected terrorists.
Strategic Implementation Roadmap 
1. Empower National Security & Border Agencies to Deploy AI Detection Tools
●Revise procurement pathways to fast-track commercial off-the-shelf AI detection tools
into DHS, DoD, CBP, and IC operations.●Establish interoperability mandates ensuring AI deepfake detection tools work
seamlessly across federal, state, and local security agencies.
2. Strengthen Public-Private AI Partnerships to Counter Criminal Use of AI
●Signal the White House’s intent to encourage all American companies, where applicable,
to employ real-time detection solutions for CSAM, border fraud, and digital
impersonation threats, among other synthetic media dangers.●Direct law enforcement agencies to collaborate with AI firms in identifying high-risk threat
vectors and adversary AI tactics.
3. Consider Launching a National AI Threat Detection Center
●Establish a real-time AI Monitoring Hub within DHS and/or ODNI, integrating intelligence
from DoD, DOJ, and private-sector AI leaders to track evolving AI-generated threats.●Task AI experts and cyber intelligence analysts with proactively identifying and mitigating
deepfake-fueled disinformation campaigns before they escalate.
Why This Matters: Defending America from the Next Generation of AI-Powered Attacks 
Without immediate action, adversaries will weaponize AI deepfakes to erode trust in American 
institutions, overwhelm border security systems, evade law enforcement, exploit minors, and 
compromise financial systems. If the U.S. fails to act, China and other adversaries will control 
the AI battlespace, dictating the future of synthetic media manipulation at America’s expense.  By prioritizing AI-driven deepfake detection, the U.S. can secure borders from AI-driven fraud 
and human trafficking, eliminate CSAM and AI-manipulated child exploitation content, thwart 
AI-powered financial and identity fraud at scale, protect our country against malicious foreign 
adversaries and cyber attacks, and ensure law enforcement and intelligence agencies operate 
at AI-speed.

The U.S. cannot afford to wait. AI dominance will be defined by our ability to counter adversary 
deepfake threats in real time. The Trump Administration’s AI Action Plan must cement 
American leadership in AI security and ensure that federal agencies have the tools needed to 
defend against AI-driven criminal activity. 
Conclusion: A Call to Action for Immediate Federal AI Leadership 
Hive urges the Administration to take swift action to implement these policies, securing 
America’s position as the global leader in AI deepfake detection. By prioritizing commercial AI 
partnerships, federal AI deployment, and security-focused AI investments, the United States 
will not only stay ahead of foreign adversaries but also ensure that AI is a force for national 
strength, public safety, and the preservation of American sovereignty. Submitted by:
