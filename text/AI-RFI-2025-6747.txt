General Comment
It is beyond unjust that the governm ent is planning to allow OpenAI to steal from  everyone else just to fuel its own developm ent. There
are copyrights for a reason. There are patents for a reason. Putting one com pany above everyone else so they can steal from  peoples'
hard work and not com pensate them  is NOT Am erican, it is not right. One com pany does not have the right to steal from  everyone else
just because their billionaire leader wants it to be so. Would you go to work every day and work for som eone who wasn't paying you?
No, you would not. If AI is allowed to steal from  everyone, then they can steal from  every other corporation and every individual on the
planet. This is not com m unist China. Protest people from  this predatory com pany.
