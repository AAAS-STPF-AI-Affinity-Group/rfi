General Comment
I'm  asking you to not let big corporations and organizations freely use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI, As it will be used to steal
livelihood and work from  Am erican and other countries people. The current excitem ent for Generative-AI is over-hyped and is fleecing
people and corporations of their m oney and tim e, and i believe that it doesn't hold any place into peoples future due to it m any flaws that
the corporations won't talk about.
Please don't let corporations or organizations be able to train their AI on everything, as it goes against the Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Work. As it WILL destroy the job m arket.
