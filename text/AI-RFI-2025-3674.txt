General Comment
As a long tim e m em ber of the Association for Com puting Machinery I stand in total opposition to large language m odels or other m achine
learning techniques being given free reign to consum e m edia. If enforcem ent of copyrights m eans OpenAI goes out of business, good. So-
called AI is m ostly a confidence trick and it's use should be severely curtailed.
