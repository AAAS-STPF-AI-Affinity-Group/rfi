General Comment
Allowing AI com panies such as Open AI free reign to use whatever sources they please to train their AI m odels, with no restriction,
recourse, or recom pense for the copyright holders, sets a dangerous precedent. This would com pletely gut any copyright protections
already in place for various creative m edia. Their business is essentially built on theft, and therefore should not exist.
