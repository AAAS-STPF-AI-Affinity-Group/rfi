General Comment
Allowing a com pany to steal from  literally anyone is outrageous and disgusting. Discoveries stolen from  the proper founder, art pieces
scrapped from  their artists, literary works plagiarized from  their authors. It’s jaw dropping that it’s even up for question but AI should
have no creative part in society. AI should be used to m ake the laborious jobs easier not give us m ore tim e to do backbreaking work. The
filth that is AI generation shouldn’t be anywhere near our lives let alone have protections. People caught tracing or plagiarizing are
punished but why is it ok if a program  does it? Forgeries are frowned upon but greed ridden people want to be protected from  the
consequences. AI is not fair use. AI is theft. It’s been proven that AI is not solid and should not be depended on as it can give no growth
or feedback or explanation for its actions while people can do just that. Different m inds can see from  different angles while AI tries to find
angles in a circle. It does not work. Allowing AI into our lives will do m ore harm  than good. AI should not have protections. There’s
nothing protecting thieves so why should a program  be given those protections? AI is a plague and letting it grow is a m istake. It’s infested
in every part of peoples honest lives and ruining them . AI is a disgusting thief, a wrongful tool, and should NOT be protected.
