To allow AI companies to take anything copyrighted would mean anything is up for grabs, all
without having the corporations worry about legal action. A prime example is how anybodycan use any higher government official, like President Trump, to be in something that he's notinvolved with (example: marching in a Pride Parade, flipping off an American family, burningthe American Flag)
Do not let OpenAI be taking copyrighted material, for not only the same of people losing jobs,
but it would mean that everyone will be in danger of AI creating fake scenarios: DonaldTrump included.
