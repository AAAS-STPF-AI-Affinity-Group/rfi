General Comment
"Artificial intelligence" is a ploy to erase artists and creators from  the act of art m aking, to steal their works so that an elite group of tech
investors can profit without com pensating the hum an beings whose hard work and talent they are stealing to m ake a sim ulacra of hum an
achievem ent. At best, we don't know enough about how these technologies work or what their practical applications m ay be. At worst,
this is an assault on our very hum anity and a devastation for all workers in all creative fields. Please do not m ove forward with this.
