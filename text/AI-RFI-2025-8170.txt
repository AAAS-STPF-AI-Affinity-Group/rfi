General Comment
Ai is a goddam n slop filled m ess of regurgitated works that have no creativity whatsoever. It wastes TON of energy to regurgitate jum bled
up things people have already said.
Ai com panies are com panies, and should be held to the sam e restrictions as norm al com panies. Letting them  do whatever they want is
HUGELY anti-profit, and will m ake worse and worse content until nothing rem ains but lost profits and sham bled industries. 
Ai is just an excuse to lay off a m assive part of our workforce for profit, which will inevitably dry up due to lack of hum an touch or
passion that m akes products and entertainm ent, as well as art, food, and other things worth purchasing. You'd lose m oney in the long run
by hiring AI, and would go bankrupt if you relied on it.
