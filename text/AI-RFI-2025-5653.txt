General Comment
We need responsible regulation of radically transform ative technologies like AI, and that m eans holding these institutions and com panies to
the highest possible standards. There is nothing gained by being the first country to destroy its own industries and com prom ise its security
by encouraging ethical and legal shortcuts in the nam e of progress. AI has great prom ise, but has at least as m uch danger if carelessly
used. I am  strongly in favor of increased regulation of AI technology, not decreased regulation.
