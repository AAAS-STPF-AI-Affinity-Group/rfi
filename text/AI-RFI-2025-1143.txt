General Comment
While our adm inistration is currently in the good graces of tech, with unregulated Ai Elon Musk can replace the governm ents power as he
has the face and voice of anyone he wants. 
Ai has the power of disruption (not a good thing despite silicon valleys fascination of the term ). 
News cant be trusted. Social cant be trusted. At som e point ruining all trusted sources will cannibalize this adm onostrations efforts tp
create a false world. 
Trum p is giving way to his replacem ent. He has built the ram p and lubricated the wheels for all his efforts to usurp him  as the jackals he
surrounds him self with realize he stands on a cliffs edge. 
I understand he does not act in the interest of hum anity, as he has worked extensively to underm ine it. 
I hope he will at least have enough self preservation to put in regulations, if not for us them  him .
