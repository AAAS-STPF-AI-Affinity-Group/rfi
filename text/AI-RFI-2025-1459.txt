General Comment
AI costs m ore, doesn't work, uses up resources inefficiently, and adds nothing. There is literally no reason to im plem ent it. Seem s like you
wouldn't want a governm ent dependent on a technology that regularly hallucinates and m akes inform ation up wholesale. Seem s like that
would be an incredibly stupid thing to do. Why are we even having this conversation? We would be better served by hinging our entire
governm ent off the m igratory m ovem ents of butterflies. At least that would be consistent.
