General Comment
Am erican ingenuity is absolutely founded on the idea that individuals own and have rights over their intellectual property. It is the entire
foundation of why we were able to reach prom inence over the global econom y so quickly. It is what influences people to try, and
arguably, gives creatively driven people (a m assive, m assive portion of all people) the will to live. These laws can not be dism antled, the
country will NOT recover. 
I personally am  46 years old, and I have only ever been a concept artist. I am  very good at it and have spent m y life honing m y skills.
There is room  for AI in all industries but using it to steal the livelihoods of m illions of people (by this I m ean, say, a corporation being
allowed to steal m y style without any paym ent to m e) is just bad for everyone. Google and open AI do not need m ore power. This not
som ething I would ever recover from  financially. My children, m y com m unity, all of us will suffer. Conversely, I suppose I could train an ai
m odel to use any style I wanted, including Pok√©m on or Disney, without any legal repercussions.
