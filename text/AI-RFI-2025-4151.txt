General Comment
Please do not allow any AI, LLM, or related services to glean any am ount of inform ation, training, or utility broadly from  copyrighted
m aterial of any kind. Art, literature, m usic, film , and gam es should be valued on their own m erits, not sim ply by what they can feed
algorithm s and m odels.
This has the potential to alter the entire United States' relationship to copyright, and I do not feel that it should; or rather, if it does, we
should alter what exists in the public dom ain for all uses rather than carving out one niche use exception for AI/LLM-related services.
