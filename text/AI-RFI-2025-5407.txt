General Comment
Generative com puter program s are NOT "artificial intelligence" in any way. They are com puter program m ing designed to stream line data
processing. When used in hard science, like the program  that was developed to decode the burnt scrolls from  ancient Herculaneum , that
generative data processing can be a force for good and learning.
But the consum er facing "AI" software, like ChatGPT or Midjourney, are little m ore than autom ated program s for taking text and art from
other people, and m ushing it together into som ething else and calling it "new". 
IF the com panies building these program s had done so in any sort of ethical way, using data sets (that is, ART and WRITING) that they
had LICENCED from  the creators, paying them  for the use of their works, then it would have been a reasonable tool. Instead, they
STOLE from  people, and gave people the ability to use those stolen works in any way possible. It was akin to taking paintings off the
walls at the Louvre, and letting people cut them  up for collage. 
Until so-called "Artificial Intelligence" is developed in ways that DO NOT steal from  others, there is NO reasonable place for it in our
governm ent.
