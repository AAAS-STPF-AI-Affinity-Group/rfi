Re: Input from the Special Competitive Studies Project on the Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan (FR Doc. 2025-02305) 
Dear Mr. D’Souza, 
On behalf of the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), I am pleased to provide this 
comprehensive input
1 for the development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. 
SCSP carries forward the vital mission of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), which was established in 2018 and had briefed President Trump in 
2019 on its initial work. We have been deeply engaged in formulating recommendations to bolster America's long-term competitiveness in the face of rapidly evolving technological landscapes, particularly concerning the rise of artificial intelligence. We recognize that this is not merely a technological challenge, but a geopolitical imperative, with profound implications for our national security, economic prosperity, and societal

2 well-being. The People's Republic of China (PRC), in particular, presents a strategic 
challenge, and our AI strategy must be crafted with this competition in mind. 
This response builds upon the foundational 2019 Executive Order (EO), 13895, 
"Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," and is further informed by the January 2025 Executive Order, 14179, "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence." We aim to provide a comprehensive strategy that advances America’s national interests. 
The 2019 EO laid a crucial foundation. However, the intervening years have witnessed 
an acceleration in AI development that necessitates a significant update. We are now in a qualitatively different phase of the technological race, one that demands even greater ambition, urgency, and a more finely-tuned strategic approach. The January 2025 EO recognizes this need, and our recommendations are designed to directly support its implementation. 
Our recommendations, presented below, are largely structured around the five key 
pillars of the 2019 EO. We have significantly expanded upon these pillars. We also added a dedicated section on national security—reflecting the inextricably intertwined nature of AI and national power in the 21st century—and, as sought in the Request for Information, a section on Protecting Our Advantages for AI Dominance. 
We welcome the opportunity to engage on our input and stand ready to address any 
questions you may have regarding our response.  
Respectfully,
