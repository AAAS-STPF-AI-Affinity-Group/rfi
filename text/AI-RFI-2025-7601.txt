General Comment
I do not want OpenAI to have im m unity from  infringem ent for any future use of m ater8al.they copy from  others. They m ust be responsible
for the ways their LLM can generate output and ensure rhey are providing appropriate oversight and coding of their LLM to ensure it
doesnt produce certain outcom es thwt could be harm ful or infringe upon anothers content. This is a no brainer.
