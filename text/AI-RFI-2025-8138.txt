General Comment
I believe AI puts individual liberty at risk and therefore the future of Am erican prosperity depends on its strict regulation.
AI technology and the deregulation of it would further dam age the lives of hardworking Am erican businesses and freelance workers who
specialize in production of m aterial such as graphic design and m usic.
It also threatens the safety of individual Am erican citizens with its known usage regarding exploitation through m isinform ation and
fabrications (including deepfakes) using AI-generated im agery, videos, and im ages, especially the safety of wom en and m inors.
