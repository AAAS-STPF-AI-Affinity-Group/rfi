General Comment
AI is not, can not be, and should not be exem pt from  the sam e laws that apply to US citizens. Using work that you do not own to
supplem ent your own incom e and growth should not be allowed under any circum stances, let alone to supplem ent the work of com panies
that have not delivered on any prom ises and will only blow governm ent funding, destroy the enviornm ent, and do absolutely nothing other
than piss funding and waste tim e.
