General Comment
I do not believe OpenAI, or rather generative AI as a whole, is a net positive for our nation, the uses AI has done has only stolen jobs
from  people in the creative com m unity, used to m ake deep fakes of anyone to ruin their reputations, and is only overly hyped up by tech
corporations as the future just to sell som ething that benefits nobody but them selves
For the sake of not only for the people of Am erica, but for the people of the world, do NOT support the advancem ent of generative AI
