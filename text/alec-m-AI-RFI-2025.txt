I do not believe AI has any place in the future, it is something I tend to hear and see in a
negative context when I’m with people. The only positive news I hear of AI is by people whohave been proven to scam and hurt others using AI generative art and other text-basedgenerative content. I do not trust it and I do not want my own posts and information that I putonline to be used to train such programs. I no longer feel confident in posting my art online asI’m constantly in fear of some company using it to train their AI program and steal mylikeness. I want to be able to know that AI won’t steal from me and others without permission.In fact, AI does not belong online or by a company, period. Do not let AI steal or use contentwithout permission.
