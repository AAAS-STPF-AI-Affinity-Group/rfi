General Comment
Hello. I am  writing this to request that this does not go through. I am  an artist, and AI has already plagued and poisoned the internet. It has
already replaced dozens of jobs, and if this goes through it will replace dozens m ore. Itâ€™s im pact on energy consum ption and clim ate
change should also not be understated as if this goes through, that also will get dram atically worse with the increase in usage.
