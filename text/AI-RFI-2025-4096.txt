General Comment
Do not give OpenAI the ability to circum vent any laws. Period. Copyright and tradem ark laws and all ownership rights are im portant
because they protect artists and perform er and allow them  to m ake a living. Those protections should carry MORE weight than the
possibility of new technology. For once those protections are gone, there will be no backstop. Everyone will be worse off.
