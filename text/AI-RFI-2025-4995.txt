General Comment
Absolutely not. Using copyrighted m aterial for A.I. training is not fair use. Allowing copyrighted m aterial for A.I. training would m ean that
copyrighting would be basically worthless, as anyone could create whatever they wanted with copyrighted m aterial and hide behind their
training m odel.
