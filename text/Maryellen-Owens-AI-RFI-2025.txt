Comments to RFI on behalf of OSTP NITRD NCO National Science Foundation
Re Ai Action plan Attn: Faisal D’Souza
Dear Mr D'SouzaAs a creative artist, writer and performer now forced to compete with
generative AI trained without my consent, license, compensation,permission or even my prior awareness, because it was stolen withoutprior notice, now being formally ruled unlawful through various courtcases setting precedent, I continue to strongly oppose the theft ofAmericans original creative works by Google, OpenAI, their subsidiariesand/or any other similar company being considered by your office at thistime.
One cannot support “Human flourishing, economic competitiveness, or
national security” without first protecting the individuals who makehuman flourishing possible (actual human persons, not algorithms).One does not protect “economic competitiveness” by destroying the rightof every American author and artist to own/reserve all rights over theirindividual original creative works.
“National security” is not at all supported if the people who produce
the wealth of our culture and greatest export, are not protected fromthe predatory actions of Google, OpenAi, and any other futureorganization attempting to steal from American authors/artists, similarly.
For reasons outlined in this letter, I submit and urge that the USA
choose to continue to honor and observe US copyright laws to the fullextent, in order to protect each individual creative artist/authoragainst the theft of their original works by corporations whose purposeis centralized control of human endeavors in order to maximize theircompanies’ profits on the backs of creators who made the very worksthese companies wish to exploit/monetize, without license, for companygains.Our labor, time, expense, sweat and originality is not for free.Further, we and our original products are not resources to be mined orpirated and pillaged at will by whomever thinks they can quietly sneakoff with it under the radar.
  That’s not the American way, and certainly
not what is reflected in the spirit of our American copyright laws,designed to reward, value and encourage new works by creative authorsand artists.
  The unlawful actions of theft by Google and OpenAi work to
deplete America’s creative treasure by harming artists and discouragenew works by them.


Any further profits by such unlawful means to corporations like Google
and OpenAi, mean the annihilation of what is critical to our human
progress and survival, the protected free expression of individual’s
thoughts and actions set to form whether written, drawn, spoken, danced,
or sung.
Thank you for sincere consideration of this vitally serious matter for
the USA and humanity.
