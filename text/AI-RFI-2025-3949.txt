General Comment
The United States of Am erica has an rich, extensive history and legacy that was built upon from  our ancestors. How was their history
passed on through? Art. Writing. Creative process of the hum an m ind, dictated through artistry. We can understand word spoken to us,
but visuals help fill in those gaps, give us som ething to help us becom e m ore im m ersed in that visual. Written language has the capability to
m ake a story feel like an adventure. Artists are responsible for m any things taken for granted. The Am erican flag, the fine business suit you
are wearing, the Rolex on your wrist, the iPhone you use for com m unication, those were engineered to work yes, but the artists m ade it
look good. Artists m ake our pathway forward colorful, elegant and beautiful. However, artists are also hum an. Hum ans need housing,
shelter, food and water. They need to be able to work and create, what this bill proposes is going to jeopardize all of that. Generative AI
is inherently theft, thievery of those who m ade our country beautiful, exciting,and full of color and joy. Generative AI has proven it has a
great creative power, but it is stolen power, taken off the backs of generations, and by enacting this bill, you are effectively taking away
every creative person's ability to be able to create and survive. 
This bill cannot pass if you truly care about the Am erican people and their capacity to create a better Future.
