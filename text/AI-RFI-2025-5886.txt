General Comment
Why would anybody think this is a good idea? This is clearly a dictatorial takeover by big tech oligarchs who want nothing m ore than the
com plete and indiscrim inate ability to do quite literally whatever they want. If this passes, our dem ocracy will be forever beholden to big
tech and those who wish the dom ination of the US political landscape. Our dem ocracy is already in one of the worst spots it has been in
since the days of the Gilded Age, and this is m erely an extension of the Gilded Age by attem pting to m ake the United States a technocratic
oligarchy ruled by those who quite literally only care about profits for them selves and their allies. This will never benefit ANY REGULAR
AMERICAN CITIZEN. This will only benefit the uber wealthy who already have by in large the m ost power in this nation. This is such a
disgusting joke, just like this country is under the Trum p adm inistration.
