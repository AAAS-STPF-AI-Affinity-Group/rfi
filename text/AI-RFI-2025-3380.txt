General Comment
I am  a theoretical physicist, and during m y PhD program  I studied and contributed to the m athem atical foundations that power today's
cutting edge AI m odels. I oppose this plan because, contrary to its wording, it benefits the com panies developing these system s rather
than the national security interest. The United States already has m ultiple agencies who could develop world-leading cutting-edge AI
system s for the benefit of national security under public authority and oversight, and who would be able to do it without needing the policy
goals described by this plan because they are public entities not acting for profit. There is no need for for profit-m otivated private
com panies, who by definition do not act in the interests of the Am erican public or national security, to be given this special treatm ent. Said
com panies advocate for this special treatm ent only because they are unable to com pete without governm ent assistance and wish to avoid
being held accountable for their brazen and uncom pensated theft of work m ade by Am ericans which they stole, not because they care in
the slightest about Am erican security, but only so that they m ight profit as m uch as they could from  the labor of others. This order is
nothing m ore than a transparent attem pt to circum vent laws that protect the Am erican people and their work from  corporate exploitation,
cloaked in the m isleading falsehood that the com panies concerned have any interest but their own in m ind. It does not serve the purpose it
claim s to, runs counter to the interest of the Am erican public, and the United States does not need this policy in order to rem ain
com petitive on the world stage anyway.
