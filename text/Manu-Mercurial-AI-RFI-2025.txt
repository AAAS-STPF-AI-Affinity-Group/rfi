As an animator working in the industry, it has never been more important than this moment
to protect the copyright system that the U.S has been built on.  
The human creativity that we enjoy every day, and give for granted, is only possible because ofartists being fairly compensated for the use of their work.
Now these few multi-billion-dollar companies and coming in, and using all this creativity,
without consent, credit, or fair payment, and just assuming they can use it to train the verymodels that want to replace this creativity, with a regurgitation of these artists work.
In what world is the benefit of a few companies, of very few people, more important than the
livelihoods of hundreds of thousands?
 
This would also be the death of true creativity.
Please protect copyright. Artists must be able to opt-out from having their work used by this
companies. Copyright laws most be respected. And those who do want to participate must befairly remunerated.
 
A.I training is theft as it stands right now.There is no excuse and no threat more important than this.
