AI has no business being trained by copywritten material nor does it have any reason. It is not
necessary to train any artificial intelligence on a human's work. It is a gross misuse of both thetechnology and the work of the human being(s) who is/are responsible for the work. Theallowance of this to continue is gross reach akin to theft.
This is not acceptable by any means.
