General Comment
All this plan is doing is legalizing theft from  the Am erican public, creators, businesses etc all under the guise of “national security”. Now
m atter how you look at it, you have private com panies com m itting theft by using professional works to train their AI m odels without
com pensation or even recognition. Those com panies in turn profit from  it from  the US governm ent and/or private com panies who utilize
their technology. There have already been several high profile cases addressing this concern. Also, there are already laws against using
som eone else’s work in their own creations without proper com pensation or acknowledgm ent/approval from  the original creator. I
strongly object for the above reasons, which should be m ore than enough, but there are other reasons that are concerning. Do not m ove
forward with this. It doesn’t help the country and it only hurts its citizens.
