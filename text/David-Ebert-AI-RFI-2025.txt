Introducti on 
The University of Oklahoma welcomes the opportunity to provide input on the development of a 
national Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan. We recognize AI’s transformative potential 
across industries and academia while also emphasizing the need for responsible development, governance, and education. This response addresses key areas of concern and opportunity, particularly within AI research, education, policy, and public perception. 
Key Areas Include: 
1.AI Research Funding and Infrastructure
A robust research ecosystem is essential for continued AI innovation. Universities serve as critical hubs for fundamental AI research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and developing ethical frameworks for AI deployment. 
•Need for Sustainable AI Research Funding:  Federal support for AI research should
prioritize long -term funding for universities, including grants that support
interdisciplinary AI studies across STEM, social sciences, and humanities.
•Access to AI Compute Resources:  Universities require access to high -performance
computing infrastructure, particularly for training and evaluating AI models. Nationalinvestments in shared research computing centers could help universities compete withindustry in AI development.
2. Bias and Explainability in AI Models
One of the fundamental challenges in AI development is mitigating bias in large language models (LLMs) a nd other AI systems.  
•Human Expertise in Research Pipelines:  It is essential to integrate domain experts
throughout the research process to ensure context-aware model development and toaddress known issues such as AI hallucinations and misinformation. Human oversight isnecessary to validate AI -generated content and prevent factual errors from propagating
within academic and professional settings. Developing robust human-computer visualinteraction with the models with incremental training is key.
•AI Model Transparency and Assurance:  AI-generated outputs must be explainable and
interpretable. Research sho uld prioritize developing tools and methodologies that allow
researchers and practitioners to assess AI decision -making and mitigate risks associated
with opaque algorithms. Explorable visualization of the decision making process is keyfor transpa rency and trustability.
•Process-Oriented Approach in Research and Education:  AI efficiency should not be
defined solely by labor reduction. Instead, AI should enhance the quality of research andanalysis, augmenting human efforts rather than replacing them. This perspective iscrucial in ensuring that the adoption of AI supports rather than diminishes the role ofgraduate students, postdocs, and faculty researchers.


3.AI’s Role in Research and Scholarly Integrity
As AI becomes increasingly integrated into academic research, there is concern about the
potential for AI-generated content to disrupt scholarly integrity.
•Preventing AI -Generated Research Cycles:  The increasing prevalence of AI -generated
articles, illustrations, and even peer reviews raises concerns about a “self -referential”
research pipeline where AI tools generate, review, and summarize their own content. This
cycle risks diminishing the reliability and originality of academic discourse. Strictguidelines should be implemented to ensure transparency in AI- assisted research and
prevent reliance on unverified AI- generated sources.
•GenAI in Humani ties and Linguistic Research:  AI has the potential to significantly
enhance research methods, such as improving handwritten text recognition (HTR) andgenerating synthetic data for low -resourced languages. These applications should be
developed with robust validation mechanisms to ensure accuracy and historical fidelity.
4.AI in Educ ation: Opportunities and Challenges
AI's integration into education presents opportunities but also challenges related to cognitiveengagement, academic integrity, and data privacy.
•Avoiding Cognitive Offloading:  AI should be used as an educational tool that enhances
critical thinking rather than replacing intellectual effort. Classroom AI use should notreduce students’ engagement to merely generating prompts while AI completesassignments.
•Emphasizing Learning Process Over Outcomes:  Students often prioritize final grades
and completed assignments over learning. AI-enabled education should reinforce theimportance of the research and learning process rather than just producing ef ficient
results.
•Ethical Considerations in AI -Assisted Teaching:  The use of AI in grading and
assessments must be carefully considered to avoid automated evaluation loops where AI-generated assignments are graded by AI. The educational system must maintainmeaningful human oversight to ensure learning outcomes align with pedagogical goals.
•Protecting Student Data and Privacy:  With increasing AI adoption, safeguarding
student data from unauthorized access and misuse is critical. AI policies should enforcestrict data privacy measures in educational applications.
5.AI Workf orce Development and Higher Education
Building a well- prepared AI workforce is crucial for the nation's economic and technological
growth. Universities play a central role in developing AI curricula, fostering interdisciplinarylearning, and equipping students with technical and ethical AI competencies.
•AI Curriculum and Interdisciplinary Education:  Universities should be key partners
in developing AI curricula that prepare students for AI -related careers. This includes
ethics, policy, and technical training to create a well -rounded AI workforce.


•Bridging the Academia -Industry Gap:  Stronger collaboration between universities and
industry can help translate academic AI research into real -world applications while
maintaining ethical and societal considerations.
6. AI for Public Good and Societal Challenges
AI has the potential to address major societal challenges, from disaster response to healthcareand environmental sustainability. Universities can serve as innovation centers for AIapplications that promote public welfare.
•AI in Public Sector and Civic Applications:  Universities play a role in developing AI
applications for public benefit, including AI-driven solutions for disaster response,healthcare equity, environmental monitoring, and more.
•AI in Public Policy and Governance:  Academic institutions can contribute to AI policy
discussions by providing independent, evidence- based research to guide ethical AI
regulations.
7.AI Stigm atization and Public Perception
Public perception of AI plays a significant role in shaping regulatory landscapes andadoption. Historical examples, such as nuclear energy and genetically modified organisms(GMOs), demonstrate how technological stigma can hinder progress.
•Addressing Public Concerns Without Hindering Innovation:  AI has been the subject
of polarized debates, with some advocating for extreme restrictions and others warning ofcatastrophic societal impacts. A balanced, evidence- based approach is essential to
mitigate undue fears while addressing legitimate concerns.
•Managing Risk Perception Through Transparent Communication:  Sensationalist
media coverage and regulatory uncertainty can amplify public apprehensions.Government agencies should implement proactive communication strategies to conveyAI’s benefits while acknowledging and addressing its risks.
•Ensuring AI’s Role in Strengthening the U.S.’s Global Leadership:  Overly restrictive
AI policies could drive innovation offshore, potentially leading to weaker safeguards inother countries. The U.S. should aim to foster AI development under a responsibleinnovation framework that maintains global competitiveness.
Conclusion 
The University of Oklahoma emphasizes the need for a balanced AI Action Plan that supports 
innovation while addressing ethical, educational, and societal challenges. Our recommendations focus on ensuring human expertise remains central in AI research  building upon robust, 
collaborative visual interaction with the AI alg orithm training and use, preventing AI- generated 
research cycles, fostering responsible AI adoption in education, and countering AI stigmatization through transparent public engagement. By implementing thoughtful policies, the U.S. can lead the way in AI development while upholding ethical and scholarly integrity. We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this critical national initiative and look forward to further collaboration on responsible AI policy development.
