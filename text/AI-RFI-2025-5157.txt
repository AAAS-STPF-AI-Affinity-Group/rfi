General Comment
Am erican AI com panies and any com pany for that m atter has to respect an artist, creator, writers, and creatives consent to use their
im ages. They MUST obtain the im age rights from  every single person they use an im age to. Sim ilar to how these com panies want to
protect their "product", this is OUR product and it m ust be respected. They m ust be held accountable for scraping data without our
consent or recom pense. These com panies are so focused on "line go up" that they would sacrifice their m orals and ethics, but its just
wrong. We have a say on how our work is used, respect our decision to opt off being scraped or pay us. 
This will only cause a dom ino effect of corporations further exploiting artists if these com panies are allowed to do whatever they want.
