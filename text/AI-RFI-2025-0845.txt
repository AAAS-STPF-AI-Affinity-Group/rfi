Re: Public Input for AI Action Plan  
Date: February 9, 2025  
Dear Office of Science and Technology Policy,  
I am writing to provide input for the AI Action Plan on behalf of 40 North Labs, creator of Photo Nodes - a 
revolutionary AI -ML platform that analyzes image data with unprecedented efficiency, Bridges 
information gaps through automated metadata tagging, and creates  seamless access to visual assets 
across enterprise organizations. Our technology represents a significant advancement in how artificial 
intelligence solutions handle image processing, analysis, and data management.  
Alignment with National Priorities our technology directly supports the administration's goal of securing 
American AI leadership while promoting economic competitiveness and preventing unnecessarily 
burdensome requirements. Photonodes has developed a groundbreaking approach that simultaneous ly 
advances technological capabilities while reducing computational overhead.  
Comprehensive AI Image Processing and Data Management our solution addresses two critical 
challenges in AI development: efficient processing and comprehensive data utilization through an 
integrated approach:  
First, our multi -modal hybrid technology maximizes data extraction from digital images through parallel 
processing streams that analyze multiple aspects simultaneously. This comprehensive approach ensures 
no valuable data remains unexploited.  
Second, our innovative auto -tagging system automatically enriches image metadata with AI -ML 
generated insights, creating searchable, actionable data from previously untapped visual information. 
This automated enhancement of metadata transforms raw images i nto valuable, searchable assets.  
Third, we've developed an integrated platform that manages the entire ecosystem of images, AI -ML 
models, and metadata. This platform provides stakeholders with simplified access to both images and 
their associated data, enabling effective collaboration and  utilization across organizations.  
Technological Innovation and Efficiency our hybrid architecture significantly reduces the computational 
resources required for AI image processing while maintaining sophisticated capabilities:  
1.Advanced Processing: Our system combines traditional computer vision with specialized
machine learning models, optimizing resource utilization.
2.Intelligent Data Management: The platform automatically organizes and indexes both images
and their AI -generated metadata, making vast image collections easily searchable and
accessible.
3.Collaborative Framework: Our integrated platform enables seamless sharing and utilization of
image assets across departments and organizations, maximizing the value of AI -processed data.

Economic and Security Benefits our comprehensive solution offers transformative potential across 
government and commercial sectors:  
1.Department of Defense Applications: Our technology can revolutionize military intelligence by
enabling rapid processing and analysis of surveillance imagery, drone footage, and satellite data
while maintaining security protocols. The reduced computational requirements allow for
deployment in field operations with limited resources.
2.Department of Energy Impact: The platform can enhance energy infrastructure monitoring
through efficient processing of inspection imagery, improving maintenance scheduling and
reducing operational costs. Our auto -tagging capabilities can accelerate the ide ntification of
potential issues in critical infrastructure.
3.Commercial Sector Innovation: By reducing computational costs and simplifying data access, we
make advanced AI capabilities accessible to businesses of all sizes. This democratization of AI
technology can drive innovation across industries from healthcare to manufacturing.
4.Cross -Sector Collaboration: Our platform enables secure sharing of AI -processed image data
between government agencies and commercial partners while maintaining appropriate access
controls and data governance.
5.Economic Efficiency: The reduction in required computing resources translates to significant
cost savings in infrastructure and energy consumption across all sectors.
Recommendations for Policy Consideration To support similar innovations, we recommend:  
1.Maintaining flexible regulatory frameworks that allow for rapid technological advancement
2.Supporting research into computational efficiency and data management improvements
3.Encouraging standardization of AI -generated metadata to facilitate interoperability
4.Promoting the development of integrated platforms that enable efficient data utilization
5.Establishing frameworks for secure cross -sector collaboration in AI development
We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this important initiative and would welcome the chance 
to provide additional technical details or demonstrations of our technology.  
Sincerely, 
Ben Crosby
