managed.  
As a global leader in advanced cooling solutions, our TSS business  develops innovative 
technologies that support critical infrastructures like data centers, which are foundational to AI 
advancements , as well as solutions for the HVACR, automotive, and semiconductor industries . 
Our portfolio includes industry -leading products such as Freon ™ 410A, which plays a key role in 
the thermal management of data centers  via traditional air-cooling methods . We also have an  
advanced two-phase immersion cooling (2 -PIC) technology , Opteon™ 2P50, in development . 
When using i mmersion cooling , all IT hardware ( servers, chips, etc.) are placed inside a  sealed 
tank and submerged in a dielectric fluid , which enables efficient heat removal without 
interfering with the functionality or safety of the  electrical components . This deep expertise in 
cooling technologies positions Chemours as a trusted partner in enabling the advanced 
computing and AI ecosystems that are transforming the world.   
As AI computing demands increase, so do the challenges of managing energy, water, and space 
constraints. Chemours’ advanced 2 -PIC technology  provides a solution to these challenges , 
offering superior heat management for chips and server components. This capability will ensure 
scalability, reliability, and peak performance for AI infrastructure critical to U.S. innovation and

AI Growth Drives Data Center Expansion  
AI technology is transforming industries worldwide, fueling exponential growth in data 
processing and storage  as well as significant investment f rom enterprises as they grapple with 
the introduction of these tools . As AI models become more sophisticated, the demand for high -
performance computing systems intensifies. Traditional  data center cooling technologies are 
simply inadequate for the U.S.’s AI leadership  aspirations . They are inefficient  due to their high 
energy and water consumption  coupled with a la ck of heat transfer capacity to support future  
generations of  IT component s. Data centers, which are vital for AI computing, consumed about 
4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023 and are expected to consume approximately 6.7 to 12% of 
total U.S. electricity by 2028 , according to the Department of Energy1. As of 2023,  it is estimated 
that data centers account for more than 17.4  billion gallons of direct water consumption  
annually, while the indirect water consumption was estimated to be over 211.3 billion gallons 
mainly driven by power generation2. These alarming values are only expected to increase 
without a substantial change in technology.   
Within AI data centers, there are hundreds of miles of data transmission cables that connect 
the chips and AI servers . Data needs to be  exchanged at very high speed through these cables  
with extremely low dela ys in a very confined space  within AI servers . Non-fluorinated  polymers 
in such cables  are challenged  to achieve these requirements for AI servers  and currently cannot 
meet performance requirements for the most advanced AI server applications .  
The Need for Next -Generation Cooling Solutions  
Cooling is traditionally underrepresented  in conversations about AI and data centers ; however, 
cooling architectures have a significant  impact on overall data center design, power use, and 
water consumption . Traditional cooling approaches are reaching their performance limits in the 
face of skyrocketing thermal demands. For instance, over 40% of data center energy 
consumption  is dedicated solely to cooling IT equipment3, and with power requirements 
increasing for next generation chips, a logical area to explore without limiting IT equipment  
development is improving and optimizing cooling systems .  
In April 2024 , Goldman Sachs reported that energy efficiency improvements have fallen to 
levels not experienced in well  over a decade . Prior to 2021,  efficiency improvements were 
driving double digit year over year improvements in data centers , however since 2022  energy 
efficiency improvements have decrease d to less than 4% and are expected to hold here through 
2030 without substantial changes in the technologies being deployed4.
Next-generation GPUs and CPUs, which form the backbone of AI systems, are generating 
unprecedented amounts of heat, far surpassing the capabilities of traditional air -cooling

systems and soon, alternative liquid -cooling architectures.  This rapid escalation in thermal 
output is not just a technical challenge but a critical bottleneck threatening the performance 
and reliability of AI infrastructure. Without innovative cooling solutions, the deployment of AI 
technologies could face signifi cant obstacles, limiting their scalability and effectiveness.  
2-PIC technology from Chemours offers a transformative solution  to these issues, providing
unparalleled efficiency in heat transfer while dramatically reducing  energy consumption, water
usage, and spatial demands compared to traditional air - and liquid -cooled systems. By enabling
the reliable operation of next -generation AI GPUs and CPUs, 2 -PIC technology not only
eliminates bottlenecks in performance but also s upports the sustainable growth of AI
infrastructure, ensuring its viability for future applicatio ns.
A Transformative Solution for AI Infrastructur e: The Key Benefits of 2 -PIC Technology  
1.Energy Efficiency:
2-PIC reduces cooling energy consumption by up to 90% when compared to air -cooled
systems, eliminating the need for pumps, fans, and air conditioning. If deployed globally,
this could generate 340 TWh in energy savings by 2055, equivalent to powering more
than 31 million households annually.
2.Water Conservation:
Unlike traditional cooling methods, which can consume millions of gallons of water
annually at a single site5, 2-PIC operates with nearly zero water use  in most climates .
This significantly reduces strain on local water resources, particularly in drought -prone
areas.
3.Compact Design:
2-PIC reduces the physical footprint of cooling infrastructure by up to 60%, when
compared to air -cooled systems , which require adequate spacing between server racks .
This allows data centers to optimize their space for increased computing capacity while
lowering capital and operational expenditures.
4.Improved Equipment Performance:
Opteon™ 2P50 operates at 50 °C (122°F) consistently  enabling systems to maintain an
optimum temperature for the IT components while also providing sufficient heat that
can be extracted from the fluid for use in other applications. The primary environmental
factors that cause IT components to fail include uneven temperatures across
components, overheating, accumulation of dust, and high humidity. When leveraging 2-
PIC, your IT equipment is operating in a sealed, dust -free environment with consistent
temperatures and no humidity, effectively extending the lifespan of IT components,
which lowers maintenance costs and reduces electronic waste .
5.Heat Transfer Capability and Capacity:
Two phase fluids in general have a higher heat transfer potential than single phase fluids
in use today such as water. This capacity is based on the phase change between a liquid
and a vapor which unlocks the fluids’ ability to utilize latent heat of vaporization. This
enables two phase fluids to have 10 -100 times greater capacity than single phase
alternatives ensuring investments in the technology are usable for years to come .

6.Comparative Baseline Study on Performance and Total Cost
Compared to  leading alternative solutions, namely single -phase immersion cooling and
single phase direct to chip  cooling, 2-PIC significantly outperforms the alternatives on a
performance and cost basis.  To validate the capabilities, value, and economic feasibility
of deploying 2-PIC in data centers, we modeled a 36 MW data center build  utilizing
Chemours 2-PIC technology , Opteon™ 2P50, in Leesburg, Virginia , which demonstrated:
•Average Capital Cost Reduction of 6%
•Average Operational  Cost Reduction of 9%
•Average Reduction in PUE (a measurement of power consumption ) of 8%
•Average reduction of the total cost of ownership of 8%
7.Environmental Stewardship :
Chemours’ Opteon ™ 2P50 dielectric fluid, a hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) based chemistry ,
combines ultra-low global warming potential (GWP) with circularity capabilities,
allowing for reprocessing and reuse to minimize environmental impact.
Chemours recognizes the importance of cross -sector collaboration to accelerate the 
deployment of advanced  technologies like 2 -PIC and fluoropolymer s in high-speed AI data 
center cables . We encourage OSTP to include the following in the AI Action Plan:  
1.Support for Advanced Cooling Solutions:
We recommend the Trump Administration provide government support to further
research through relevant federal agencies and  encourage collaboration between public
and private sectors  to support the development and adoption of high -efficiency cooling
technologies that align with AI infrastructure needs.  Many of the new cooling solutions
coming to market require a change in design as well as standard operating procedures .
Coalitions with a combination of public and private sector resources can effectively
overcome these changes to set the standard for industry.
2.Regulatory Certainty  and Overcoming Regulatory Hurdles :
The unique properties of some fluorinated chemistries make them ideal to tackle the
challenges in powering and operating data centers and related facilities, and these
innovative new molecules can be advanced while still protecting human health and the
environment . The current process for bringing a new c hemical to market  through the
EPA Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) has been challenged since the law was
amended in 2016 . The process is arduous and time -consuming, which means
innovation s often lose the ir competit ive edge in the American marke t. The agency has
an opportunity to improve the process by making it more efficient, transparen t, and
collaborati ve with industry to  create impactful changes that are durable enough to
withstand future attempts at reversals. We encourage EPA to collaborate with industry ,
use measured data, better define reasonably foreseeable conditions of use , and
negotiate consent orders that don't extinguish the market case.  These regulatory
hurdles have created a bottleneck at EP A and threaten the ability for America to swiftly
adopt new technologies that can drive our  competitiveness globally . 
At Chemours, we believe that AI innovation should be supported by sustainable infrastructure 
that balances performance, cost, and environmental impact  while retaining America’s AI 
leadership position . We appreciate the work the Trump Administration is undertaking to 
become the global leader in AI and the support we are seeing across the federal government to 


ensure we right -size the infrastructure to support th ese initiatives. We look forward to  continued 
engagement with OSTP and the White House as they develop an AI Action Plan that underscores 
America’s  leadership in both AI and innovation.
