General Comment
No com pany deserves to take such m assive quantities of data without the consent of the people to whom  it belongs. The “artificial
intelligence” industry as it exists presently is a scam , and a bubble that will soon burst. The public should not have to pay for the m istake
that is the m ass adoption of this snake oil.
