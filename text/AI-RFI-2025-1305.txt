General Comment
AI will only lead to wasteful spending on not only tax payers but anyone who steps foot in the US and it's territories. It is a waste of
everyone's tim e and m oney, and has absolutely no benefit to anyone. It will only give biased or com pletely wrong inform ation as it is an
unreliable source and should be nowhere near any official position. It will only harm  Am erica and our Allies, because that is what Gen AI
does, it will use our Natural resources faster, m aking us (governm ent and citizen alike) spend m ore especially with the tariffs that are being
put on other countries. To restate, This will never help any citizen and will only harm  them , if Republicans truly care about us (citizens) then
this should be stricken down and never looked at again.
