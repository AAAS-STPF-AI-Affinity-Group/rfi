General Comment
Absolutely not. Giving governm ent sanction and cover to the m ass seizure, theft, and devaluation of hum an thought, ingenuity, creativity,
inspiration, and labor is unconscionable. The governm ent should be acting to protect the sum  total of hum an intellectual undertaking, not to
funnel it over to com puter program s that hoover it up and spit it back out, worse in every conceivable way.
