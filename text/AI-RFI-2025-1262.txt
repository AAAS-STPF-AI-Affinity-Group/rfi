communicating with human beings as well as other d evices” ( Xia et al., 2012 ). At the core of the 
Internet of Things lays the smart product —equipped with RFID technology  
Smart Products:  At the core of the Internet of Things lays the smart product – equipped with 
RFID technology.  Three typical elements of smart products. Physical components, smart 
components and connectivity components.  The physical component is the product’s mechanical 
and electrical parts. The smart components are the product’s software, sensors, data storage 
and other similar features. The last componen t is the connectivity components. It consists of the 
protocols or ports that enable the connection betw een products or human beings.  
Generative AI:  This can able to create something entirely new, including text, images, audio, 
synthetic data and many more. Deep learning models, multi -modal AI technologies, real -time

Proposed Journal of AI and Knowledge Engineering  
(JAIKE )—Description  
The Research in AI and Knowledge Engineering Journal is designed to be a multi -disciplinary, 
fully refereed international journal that publishes  
•Theoretical and experiential papers, research notes, case studies, and novel aspects of
knowledge engineering and IOTs .
•Critical review papers to discuss the state of the art in today's lifecycle -oriented,
knowledge -based era of product development , as well as state -of-the-art research.
Accepted papers are grouped for publication so that individual issues focus on a small number 
of theme areas. In addition to archival papers, the journal also conducts reviews in a timely 
fashion and informs authors of decisions with a target turnaround ti me of 3 -6 months.  
Why “ AI & Knowledge Engineering” A new Journal?  
Today, while our products (like wireless devices, computers, etc.) are becoming smarter and 
their size shrinking, we are witnessing an increased use of AI in knowledge engineering for 
developing such “smart” features, logics, and behaviors. There is a series of ongoing intensive 
debates in research communities on the importance of KEAI for this new smarter business world. 
In recent years, the conventional techn iques of product development approaches have evolved 
into so called knowledge -based engineering an d AI field. As a result, the new KEI approach has 
found many application -grounds and opportunities not only in the popular economic worlds but 
also in other areas such as education, urban planning and development, governance,  and 
healthcare, and so on. Today many US and international organizations are beginning to adopt 
AI and Knowledge Engineering  techniques, tools,  and their process frameworks for achieving 
key strategic advantages and for obtaining supremacy in collaborative product development and 
globa l competitiveness.

Knowledge Management vs Knowledge 
Engineering.  
Brian D. Newman © January 5, 1996  
The terms knowledge management and knowledge 
engineering see m to be used as interchangeably. A 
brief examination of the terms : management and 
engineering shows that to manage is to exercise 
executive, administrative and supervisory direction, 
whereas , to engineer is to lay out, construct, or 
contrive or plan out, usually with more or less subtle 
skill and craft.

Possible Journals  that May compete with AI and 
Knowledge Engineering  (JAIKE ) Journal — (Tentative)
There is no engineering journal title, I could find  surfing the net that closely  match with KEM. 
There is no completion , I believe for KEM Journal  as it stands today . I could only find one -- Int. 
J. of Knowledge -based and Intelligent Engineer ing Systems, which is a software -focused
Journal as opposed to RKEM – which is a “r esear ch-focused Journal . The coverage and
contents are also quite  different.

Proposed Journal of Knowledge Engineering and AI 
(JKEAI) —Description  
The Research in Knowledge Engineering and IOTs  is designed to be a multi -disciplinary, fully 
refereed international journal that publishes  
•Theoretical and experiential papers, research notes, case studies, and novel aspects of
knowledge engineering and IOTs .
•Critical review papers to discuss the state of the art in today's lifecycle -oriented,
knowledge -based era of product development , as well as state -of-the-art research.
Accepted papers are grouped for publication so that individual issues focus on a small number 
of theme areas. In addition to archival papers, the journal also conducts reviews in a timely 
fashion and informs authors of decisions with a target turnaround time of 3 -6 months.  
Why “Knowledge Engineering & AI” A new Journal?  
Today, while our products (like wireless devices, computers, etc.) are becoming smarter and 
their size shrinking, we are witnessing an increased use of knowledge engineering & AI for 
developing such “smart” features, logics, and behaviors. There is a series of ongoing intensive 
debates in research communities on the importance of KEAI for this new smarter business 
world. In recent years, the conventional techniques of product development approaches have 
evolved into so called knowledge -based engineering and AI field. As a result, the new KEI 
approach has found many application -grounds and opportunities not only in the popular 
economic worlds but also in other areas such as education, urban planning and development, 
governance and healthcare, and so on. Today many US and international organizations are 
beginning to adopt knowledge engineering and AI techniques, tools and their process 
frameworks for achieving key strategic advantages and for obtaining supremacy in 
collaborative product development and global competitiveness.

Knowledge Engineering is a growing and new field of 
product development and is applicable to many large 
industries such as aerospace, mechanical, electrical, 
civil, ship building, appliances, computers, helicopters , 
railroads and space shuttles, etc. The following Link

Knowledge Management vs Knowledge 
Engineering.  
Brian D. Newman © January 5, 1996  
The terms knowledge management and knowledge 
engineering see m to be used as interchangeably. A 
brief examination of the terms : management and 
engineering shows that to manage is to exercise 
executive, administrative and supervisory direction, 
whereas , to engineer is to lay out, construct, or 
contrive or plan out, usually with more or less subtle 
skill and craft.

Possible Journals  that May compete with Knowledge 
Engineering and AI (JKEAI) Journal — (Tentative)  
There is no engineering journal title, I could find  surfing the net that closely  match with KEM. 
There is no completion , I believe for KEM Journal  as it stands today . I could only find one -- Int. 
J. of Knowledge -based and Intelligent Engineer ing Systems, which is a software -focused
Journal as opposed to RKEM – which is a “r esear ch-focused Journal . The coverage and
contents are also quite  different.
