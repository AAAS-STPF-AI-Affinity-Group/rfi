General Comment
I do not believe that generative AI has any future in the arts, hum anities, or sciences in the United States. These technologies are used to
take jobs away from  hardworking Am erican people, creating a lower quality product at the expense of talented Am ericans. Often, their
original and copyrighted works are used without knowledge or consent to create these program s. The United States should take a stand
with talented, hardworking writers, artists and other creators to create legislation lim iting the use of generative AI and ensuring artisans
retain the rights to their original intellectual properties. The United States should rem ain a global leader and set a positive exam ple for
others worldwide.
