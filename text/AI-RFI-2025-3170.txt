General Comment
AI technology such as what is being pushed by this action plan scrapes content and creative works indiscrim inately including from  those
who did not consent to have their creative works used in such a m anner. What incentive will there be for creative to engage in their artistic
pursuits if their work is at risk of becom ing fodder for to "train" off of and produce subpar slop from ? Not only does the technology
engage in blatant theft, it will also destroy creative industries by asking them  to buy into a technology that will just regurgitate whatever you
feed it. Please do not let this becom e our creative standard.
