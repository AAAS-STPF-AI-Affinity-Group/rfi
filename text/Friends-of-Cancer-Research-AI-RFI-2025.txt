Reque st for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
Ensuring Efficient and Innovative Regulatory Approaches for AI in Drug Development  
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) into drug 
development and diagnostics presents unprecedented opportunities to enhance patient 
care, streamline drug discovery, and improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment 
selection. However, these technol ogies may require a new regulatory paradigm, particularly 
given their adaptive nature. To ensure safety, efficacy, and reliability, regulatory frameworks must evolve to accommodate AI -driven innovations while maintaining robust oversight 
mechanisms. 
This comment outlines key considerations for regulatory oversight and policy development 
to support the safe and effective integration of AI/ML technologies into drug development,  
leveraging lessons learned from ongoing pilot projects focused on computational pathology 
and diagnostics.
1 These recommendations align with the goals of the AI Action Plan by 
providing structured policy actions that promote AI innovation while ensuring regulatory clarity and patient safety. 
Key Considerations for AI in Drug Development  
1.Adapting FDA Regulatory Pathways for AI/ML Platforms
Given the dynamic nature of AI/ML models, novel regulatory approaches should account for 
their continuous learning and evolving capabilities. Potential actions include: 
•Risk -Based Regulatory Framework:  FDA should implement a risk -based approach
tailored to the intended use of AI -based platforms. A flexible yet structured
framework will ensure that regulatory expectations align with patient -centered
benefit -risk considerations.

•Clarifying Regulatory Expectations:  FDA guidance should explicitly define the
evidence required for AI -based tools in oncology clinical trials, including
computational pathology and biomarker evaluation.
•Prospective Criteria for AI Validation:  Establishing predefined performance criteria
and validation standards can support the rapid and safe deployment of AI in clinical
decision -making.
2.Developing Expedited Validation Processes using Reference Data Sets
Reliable and standardized datasets are essential for AI model validation and regulatory assessment. Reference datasets can:  
•Support model comparability across different AI -based tools, similar to how
biomarker assays are validated.
•Enable independent validation, ensuring AI models perform consistently in the
intended use population.
•Reduce variability in AI -based tools , enhancing regulatory decision -making and
clinical adoption.
As outlined in the Friends of Cancer Research Digital PATH Project, publicly available 
reference datasets can provide a benchmark for efficiently assessing AI performance.2 
These datasets should be representative of all  populations and include critical metadata 
such as clinical characteristics, image acquisition details, and biomarker distributions. 
Such an approach would be substantially more efficient than current requirements, in which 
individual validation processes would need to be constructed for each tool.   
3.Defining Performance Metrics and Standards
To ensure AI -based diagnostic and prognostic tools are reliable and reproducible, 
standardized performance metrics are necessary. Regulatory actions should include: 
•Analytical Validation:  AI models should undergo accuracy, precision, and
interchangeability assessments to ensure reliability across different settings.
•Clinical Validation:  AI-driven diagnostics should demonstrate clinical validation
through well -defined sensitivity, specificity, and treatment -response predictions,
when appropriate .

•Regulatory Harmonization:  Collaboration between regulatory agencies, industry
leaders, academic researchers, and patient advocates can help align performance
expectations for AI -driven drug development.
Policy Actions and Opportunities  
To facilitate the integration of AI/ML into regulatory pathways, several opportunities are 
noted:  
•Establish a Clear AI Regulatory Framework:  Develop specific guidance for the use
of AI in clinical research and care, detailing expectations for data quality, validation,
and clinical evidence generation.
•Develop an Expedited Validation Pathway:  Support initiatives that generate non-
proprietary reference datasets to facilitate independent validation of AI models and
enhance regulatory review efficiency.
•Implement Adaptive Regulatory Mechanisms:  Advance adaptive regulatory
mechanisms that enable iterative AI model updates based on real -world data,
aligning with established approaches for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) .
•Encourage Cross-Sector Collaboration:  Strengthen partnerships among regulatory
agencies, industry leaders, and academic institutions to establish best practices for
AI-driven diagnostics and digital pathology applications.
Conclusion  
AI and ML hold immense potential to revolutionize drug development and patient care. 
However, realizing their full benefits requires regulatory policies that balance innovation 
with rigorous oversight. By establishing robust reference datasets, defining cl ear 
performance metrics, and developing adaptive regulatory frameworks, stakeholders can 
work together to ensure AI technologies are safely and effectively integrated into the future 
of precision medicine and oncology drug development.  
We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this Request for Information and look forward 
to working collaboratively with policymakers to consider these recommendations in 
developing an AI Action Plan that promotes both innovation and patient safety.
