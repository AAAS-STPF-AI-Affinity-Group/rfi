General Comment
AI com panies are currently stealing creative works, and this m easure would not only legalize it but m ake it so only big com panies like
Google, OpenAI, and sim ilar Big Tech industries are able to use the technology.
This behavior will only enable Big Tech's grip on the public consciousness, regardless of whichever political leaning the com pany m ay
have.
