General Comment
Please enforce copyright law and protect m illions of jobs. The ethics of AI use are non-negotiable. The copyright and ownership of a
piece of m edia, whether it be art, m ovies or m usic, belong to the original creator. AI has been used as a justification to avoid
accountability for unauthorized use of copyright m aterial. This has larger im plications for everyone. Sm aller creators having their work
stolen to be a part of an AI m odel without consent is an issue we are facing today.
AI has a place in scientific research and should continue to follow proper procedure for data collection under the close watch of an ethics
board. The collection of m edical data, proper peer review, studies under m ultiple AI m odels to account for bias. These will be and are
issues facing AI assisted research.
I present these issues in the hopes of bringing awareness and working towards a solution
