General Comment
I am  an artist and general creative newly working in the industry. Art is, quite literally, in everything. From  the cars we drive, to the chairs
we sit upon, to the advertisem ents we see day to day. It is EVERYWHERE and it is m ost powerful when created by another hum an
being. These creations deserve to be protected because artist keep the world m oving. Without copyright protection, it could potentially
throw the world of advertising and m edia into chaos. These are huge econom ic boons as of now, and losing them  to AI copyright would
be disastrous.
