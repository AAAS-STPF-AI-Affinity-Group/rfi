General Comment
On behalf of creatives everywhere, generative AI is built on the theft of our work, and allowing it to bypass the sam e copyright regulations
that we're expected to abide by would be the death of Am erican creativity. For all the fear m ongering about being overtaken by China on
the world's stage, this adm inistration seem s hellbent on giving them  every opportunity to do just that.
