General Comment
You can't seriously be considering allowing AI m odels to steal from  people and have the m aterial they churn out be copyright protected,
right? This is a joke?
People work hard to learn and hone a craft and develop a unique style, and you're considering allowing m achines to ape all that hard
work for no cost AND grant the products based off of stolen work legal protections?
Insane.
