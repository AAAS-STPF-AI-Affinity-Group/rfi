The government shake up and transparency are GREAT!! Keep up the good work, and shake 
until all the bad nuts are out of the trees and off the ground. My thoughts on AI: The goal of AI 
should be to assist, teach NOT to do the life tasks that humans need to do to stay active, alert, 
engaged and a vital contributing member to society. AI, should: have an override option; be easy 
to distinguish from a human, by look and/or voice inflections; and have the capability to teach 
course curriculums such as Foreign la nguages, mathematical sciences and disciplines: from 
elementary to PhD calculus; Accounting; Commerce. Sciences: physics; Astronomy; chemistry; 
biology; zoology; metrology; etc. Farming: Agriculture; Horticulture (how to grow a family 
garden); Botany; Husb andry. History; Reading; Composition: Writing (including cursive)
