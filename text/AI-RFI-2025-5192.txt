General Comment
Concentrating on 'AI' dom inance will leave the United States weaker in the long term . Already, there are signs that the AI race has been
lost and m any of the solutions GenAI professed to provide have not m aterialized. It has becom e a source of m isinform ation and a lot of
serious technologists are rightfully ignoring it. Anytim e you require accuracy--which is true in m ost roles-- GenAI will disappoint you with
fake inform ation it pulled out of a grab bag of statistics. It has no understanding of what 'correct' inform ation is. Finally, it creates a gigantic
cybersecurity risk-- to m ake your AI 'sm arter and m ore accurate', you would want to hook them  up to m ore and m ore sources of
inform ation. With that in m ind, anyone who has access to that AI can ask it anything-- potentially causing a data leak. They are notoriously
hard to keep secure and build safeguards around. By integrating all of this technology into corporations and governm ent entities, it just
creates opportunities for data theft.
Furtherm ore, GenAI is discouraging our younger generation, leaving them  without the capacity for critical thought (and vulnerable to
m isinform ation). It robs them  of perseverance-- after all, if an AI m achine can do it better than you can in a couple of seconds, what is the
point of trying? 
Pursuing AI will weaken our workforce. We need professionals who know what they are doing. Pursue LLMs for specific use cases, but
stay clear from  GenAI.
