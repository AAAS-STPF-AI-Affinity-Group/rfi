General Comment
Exem pting com panies breaking the law from  the laws they break allows lawlessness. Our nation's laws were designed to protect
individuals and sm all businesses from  other individuals and businesses who wish to undercut or harm  them  in ways that are unjust or
unnecessarily brutal. 
Allowing AI com panies to circum vent our copyright system , a system  that exists to prom ote com petition between Am erica's com panies,
allows them  to profit off of the works of sm all businesses while directly com peting with them . This kills Am erica's sm all businesses.
If the governm ent attem pts to go forward with this plan, all copyright holders m ust be reim bursed, by the governm ent, on a consistent
basis.
