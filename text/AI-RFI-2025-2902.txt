General Comment
I do not wish for AI to be openly supported like this, or in any m anner sim ilar. AI is built on stolen inform ation and m edia, and I do not
want a plan that allows them  to continue doing so without any backlash whatsoever. Whatever data is used to train AI does not belong to
the AI's developers, but to the original creators of said data and m edia. Additionally, even with this stolen data, AI has been proven to be
faulty num erous tim es, and I do not see any benefit is developing AI further.
