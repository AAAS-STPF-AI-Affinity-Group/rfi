Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the ability to revolutionize society in the following years. Here 
are the areas that this administration should focus on concerning AI: -Ensure that both smaller 
and larger AI firms have an equal playing field to advance AI . It should not be solely limited to 
"big tech." -Ensure that user privacy is at the forefront of AI. Examining both local -processing 
and cloud -hosted AI solutions are key on this. -Ensure that information distributed by AI is 
accurate and as neutral and f ree of bias as possible, ensuring that the public has the ability to 
know what information is being promoted and demoted over AI. -Ensure that AI is being used 
for ethical purposes and used to supplement, not replace human intelligence. -Ensure that as 
much of AI can be "American Intelligence", with servers hosted in the USA, programmers 
residing in the USA, and that AI investments are made in America first. -AI and DOGE can 
work together to find ways to utilize AI to make the government run more efficientl y.
