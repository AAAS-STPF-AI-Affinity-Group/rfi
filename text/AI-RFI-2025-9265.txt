General Comment
This is horrid and would allow AI developers to legally steal from  artists, writers, and all who create works of art, science or in any field.
This m ust absolutely not pass, AI cannot be allowed this freedom . We as Am ericans and people as a whole would be willingly throwing
away another piece of our hum anity and giving AI tools m ore power to infest our lives.
No.
No.
And in case this was not clear enough: No.
