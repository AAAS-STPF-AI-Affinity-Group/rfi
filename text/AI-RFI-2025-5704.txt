General Comment
AI com panies and developers CANNOT be allowed to use any copyrighted content unless they get the EXPRESS perm ission of the
creator. Be it som eones voice, likeness, artwork, writing.

People will becom e lazy and thoughtless. Instead of learning how to do som ething they will just rely on som e potentially flawed input in an
application that m ay or m ay not be right, just because som e application says so. 
People have to be protected. Com puters are a useful tool, but you have to use them  properly, learn how to use them  appropriately.
Hundreds of thousands of people will be affected by this right now.
EVERYONE will be affected by it in the future.
What happens when proprietary inform ation or state secrets gets "accidentally" entered or accessed.
Can a com pany be trusted with that inform ation? What happens when that com pany is bought by another com pany that doesn't have
owners in the sam e country (regardless of whether it's the US, China, Russia, elsewhere).
