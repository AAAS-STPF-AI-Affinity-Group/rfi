IAVM Com m ent - AI Policy Considerations for Venue Managem ent and Events Industry 3.14.25


DRAFT : AI Action Plan Response Framework for the International Association of Venue Managers (IAVM)  
Subject : AI Policy Considerations for Venue Management and Events Industry Date: [ 03/14/25 ] 
Submitted by : Trevor  Mitchell/ International Association of Venue Managers  
To: Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), National Science Foundation (NSF) Submission 
Method:  Federal Register Portal  
Introduction & Purpose  
The International Association of Venue Managers (IAVM) represents public assembly venues from 
around the globe. IAVM’s active members include managers and senior executives from auditoriums, 
arenas, convention centers, exhibit halls, stadiums, performing a rts centers, university complexes, 
fairgrounds and amphitheaters.  
Member venues represent significant public and private investments, attracting millions of patrons to an 
astonishing variety of events, including sports, concerts, conventions, conferences, and performing arts 
productions.  
IAVM also includes over 500 Allied companies, providing products and services critical to venue 
operations. AI technology has the potential to enhance efficiencies, security, sustainability, and guest 
experiences across these venues, making AI policy a key  consideration for our industry.  
This response highlights priority AI policy actions that support safe, efficient, and customer -friendly 
venue management without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens.  
1. AI in Security & Crowd Management
•AI-driven facial recognition, threat detection, and crowd analytics enhance safety at large -scale
events.
•AI can support emergency response by connecting city, state, and federal first responders to
incidents in real time, granting security camera access, deploying drones, and delivering live
situation reports.
•The federal government should not dictate best practices but should offer resources to the live
event industry to develop its own best practices, similar to how the DHS participated in the
Exhibitions & Meetings Safety & Security Initiative.
•Industry experts, rather than government agencies, should lead security best practices
development, as they can pivot more effectively than regulatory bodies.
•It is in the industry’s best interest to avoid creating a TSA -type agency for live event security.
2. AI in Event Operations
•AI can identify actual visitor patterns, exhibitor traffic flow, and optimize event operations,
including congestion mitigation and wayfinding.


•AI should be leveraged to improve booking optimization and dynamic pricing, ensuring venues
maximize profitability and economic impact.
•AI can streamline document integration, automatically transposing event details, license
agreements, and third -party contracts into a single source.
•AI can aid in vendor identification, sourcing local farms, tracking food origin and safety, and
managing inventory quantities and controls.
3. AI for Ticketing, Guest Experience & Accessibility
•AI-based fraud detection in ticketing helps combat counterfeit tickets and scalping.
•AI-enhanced language translation, chatbot concierge services, and accessibility tools improve
guest experiences for diverse audiences.
•The federal government’s AI Action Plan should support accessibility -driven innovation,
ensuring AI technologies are widely available for ADA compliance and guest engagement.
4. AI and Workforce Development
•AI-driven staffing analytics can improve event labor allocation, ensuring operational efficiency
while reducing costs.
•Federal AI policy should prioritize workforce training programs that equip event professionals
with AI literacy and new job skills.
•AI-driven automation in concessions, security, and guest services should be balanced with
human oversight and job creation strategies.
5. AI and Clean, Sanitized Operations
•AI-driven robotic cleaning solutions can enhance sanitation protocols, including automated
vacuuming, disinfection, and restroom maintenance.
•AI can assist in hazardous materials management, including storage, inventory tracking, and
compliance with Safety Data Sheets.
•Federal policies should support, but not impose, regulatory requirements for AI -driven
sanitation and safety enhancements.
6. AI, Data Privacy, and Cybersecurity
•AI systems in venues collect and process guest data, raising privacy and cybersecurity concerns.
•Given that venues are categorized as critical infrastructure, AI integration should adhere to
CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) standards and protocols for
protection.


•Federal guidance on AI -driven data security should be tailored to high -traffic event spaces to
ensure compliance without excessive administrative burden.
7. Ethical AI Deployment
•AI initiatives should prioritize aggregated, anonymized data collection to comply with regulations
and uphold attendee trust.
•Any trained AI system inherently introduces bias. Instead of broadly focusing on eliminating bias,
policies should ensure datasets are structured to prevent discrimination and produce fair
outcomes.
•AI should augment, not replace, human decision -making. Human -in-the-loop mechanisms
ensure accuracy and accountability.
•AI should not replace key human roles in oversight, safety, and decision -making. Professional
licensing should be upheld to maintain critical human expertise.
•AI funding should support businesses of all sizes, not just large corporations. AI consulting and
implementation costs can disproportionately affect small businesses in the events industry.
8. AI in Human Resources & Workforce Integrity
•AI-generated resumes pose challenges for HR professionals in verifying authenticity. AI must
incorporate processes to remove false data and encourage accurate representations of
individuals.
•cannot replace the ability to think critically, plan spontaneously, and make real -time decisions in
high -intensity situations. Venue managers must rely on human expertise to protect public health
and safety.
•Physical emergency response and triage in large -scale venues require human intervention, as AI
lacks the capacity to respond dynamically in unpredictable, high -risk situations.
•Personnel must be able to "show their work" in a way that AI cannot. AI -generated work must be
supported by human oversight to maintain accountability and decision -making integrity.
•The Department of Labor should provide professional training for HR professionals to address
AI’s impact on workforce recruitment, hiring, and verification processes.
•Businesses and venues face significant financial risks when hiring the wrong individuals.
Government support in refining AI -based hiring tools is necessary to minimize these risks.
•AI should be leveraged to expedite and streamline the immigration process, particularly for
tourism, service, hospitality, and live event industries.


Conclusion & Next Steps  
IAVM appreciates the opportunity to provide input on the AI Action Plan. We welcome further dialogue 
and request participation in AI policy roundtables or industry working groups to provide industry -specific 
expertise.
