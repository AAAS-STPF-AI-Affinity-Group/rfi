General Comment
The sam e laws should apply to giant AI com panies as to everyone else. If ordinary people are restricted by copyright law to the lim ited
cases outlined by fair use for 70+ years after the work's creation, why should different rules apply to AI training? After all, an AI trained
on a work m ay quote from  it without attribution, perhaps significantly, recognizably so, thereby potentially causing the end user to
plagiarize the work. If copyright law is inappropriate for the pursuit of this technology, either Congress m ust change the law, or AI
com panies m ust pay for access and use of this m aterial like any other Am erican.
