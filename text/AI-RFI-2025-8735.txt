General Comment
Copyrighted content used to train AIs m ust be com pensated, period. Their work was stolen and now their voice and artistic approaches
can be used by anyone without perm ission. As a firm  that has created process, approaches and case studies, I donâ€™t relish the idea that it
can all be stolen by AI if I choose to share it in public realm s.
