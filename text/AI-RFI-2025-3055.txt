General Comment
The violation of intellectual rights and properties by a tool that cannot inherently create nor contribute by an artificial tool that is not
recognized as an entity considered with sapience or independence to understand such works is willfully ignorant on the entities and
individuals responsible for such a tool. The intent shall incite a chain of events to suppress com petitive practices and underm ine the
principles and values of the free m arket, and will provide a path of replacing our current system  with socialist and/or com m unist rhetoric
that m ay spread to other industries.
