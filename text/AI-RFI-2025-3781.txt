General Comment
As an Am erican I’ve seen how AI com panies are actively advertising their services as ways to push workers out because their program s
“don’t as for work benefits.” “Don’t need a raise.” in front of m ultiple office buildings and public transportation services. These
advertisem ents are terrifying especially in a struggling job m arket.
I do not support AI com panies training their program s on works it doesn’t own let alone training on copy righted works as these
com panies seek to steal the livelihood and paychecks of m illions of Am erican workers.
I reject this plan.
