General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US, with the theft of copyrighted m aterials it could becom e a DANGEROUS tool
and could affect the safety of our country. Would you be cool if som ebody took a picture of your fam ily and m ade im ages of them  doing
things you're not okay with?
