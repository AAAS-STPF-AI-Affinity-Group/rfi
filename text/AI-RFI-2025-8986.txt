General Comment
If this was really a m atter of national security, the m ilitary could nationalize generative AI developm ent rather than leave it as a com m ercial
enterprise (that happens to be ravaging huge swaths of Am erican industry). As a non-com m ercial governm ent project, generative AI
would have access to all the training data it needed. The fact that this is not even being proposed gives the lie to the stated rationale for
these changes. There is no reason to exem pt tech com panies from  the laws that bind the rest of us.
