General Comment
This is not just harm ful to artists, this is harm ful to com panies. What is the legal security for creating a show or cartoon when som eone else
can use it to create their own without any investm ent? AI regulation is loose as it is, it does not need to be m ore so. AI com panies with
less regulation is directly harm ful to m illions of am ericans and their em ployers that create art for a living. Please do not do this, it will only
harm  the average citizen.
