General Comment
AI being able to infiltrate copyrighted m aterial is super dam aging to anyone who associates to the creative field. It can take away jobs and
on top of that, destroys our dying environm ent. 
For exam ple, there was a strike regarding a bunch of voice actors because the com pany “Hoyoverse” wanted to drop AI regulations. The
voice actors did not endorse the idea because essentially, the AI would be stealing real people’s voice for the com panies profit and not
the actors. Another exam ple is the coca-cola com m ercial back in Decem ber of 2024. The industry stated that using AI for the com m ercial
saved them  a lot of m oney. Mind you, this is a billion dollar com pany who sells 1000 soda per m inute. These are exam ples of big
industries using AI to save m oney on those who create and express creativity. 
Creativity is essentially a hum an idea that was created to express history and expression. What will happen when our future historians tries
to find history when all their is AI? Creativity takes tim e and skill. A lot of creators used creativity to express them selves and in occasion,
save them  in horrid m ental states.
Not only AI destroys creativity, it destroys our environm ent. AI uses one bottle of water per prom pt. We are already dealing with a dying
environm ent in 2025, why m ust be add to it? 
As som eone who has grew up in creativity, please do not allow this to dig into our hard work that we grasp so strongly to. The only thing
protecting our creativity is copyright.
