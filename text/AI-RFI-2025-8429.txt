General Comment
If Open AI wants to train on Copyrighted works, they need to PAY FOR IT. IT IS THEFT IF THEY DON'T. I'm  failing to see why this
is so hard to com prehend. They steal the words and art of people, and then they m ake m oney off of it. 
There is no security threat that will be solved by stealing from  creatives. It is ridiculous to think that. And if such a threat exists, then m aybe
som e of that defense budget m oney could be used to com pensate artists and writers FAIRLY for their work being used.
