General Comment
Do not allow OpenAI to use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI. It is THEFT. AI has no place in the future of the U.S. It is trained on
stolen m aterial, destroys vital environm ental resources such as potable water, it is easily m anipulated and rarely produces accurate or
trustworthy results and takes jobs away from  actual hum an beings. No one with an ounce of sense could possibly support the usage of AI
unless they have som ething to gain from  it directly, at great expense to others.
