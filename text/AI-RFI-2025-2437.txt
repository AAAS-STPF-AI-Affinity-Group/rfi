General Comment
We should NOT be putting resources into developing generative AI, unless we are using that to COMBAT generative AI. Generative AI
uses an incredible am ount of electrical and water resources on an already strained system . Generative AI, by its nature, is developed by
stealing work from  artists and authors. It is easily used to spread m isinform ation. It is already being used to create inappropriate videos
and im ages of governm ent officials. Generative AI is dangerous.
