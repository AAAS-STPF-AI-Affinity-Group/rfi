General Comment
I call for the governm ent I elect and pay for to stop any provider Or builder of AI from  stealing content that does not belong to them  or
whose rights they have no legal access already. Just because they can do som ething digitally does not m ean it is good or legal. As a writer,
a director and m aker of IP, I do not give m y perm ission for anyone to use anything Without m y written consent. This has been the law for
100s of years. Let it rem ain our law!
