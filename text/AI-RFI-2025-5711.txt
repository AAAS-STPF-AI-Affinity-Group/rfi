General Comment
The so-called "Generative AI" boom  is a scam  to fleece businesses, private citizens, and the governm ent of both investm ent capital and
data that can then be used to enrich the people pushing it at the expense of everyone else. Aside from  the data scraping it is largely driven
by glorified autocom plete algorithm s and underpaid hum an labor (to "edit" the garbled and hallucinated output into a legible form ) rather
than any genuine intelligence, and it cannot be allowed free reign over our nation's econom y and culture. I do not believe this falsely-
advertised and harm ful technology holds any place in the future of this country, except possibly an enorm ous em barrassm ent to look back
on if this plan is put into effect.
