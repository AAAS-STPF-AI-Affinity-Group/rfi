General Comment
Any adm inistration seeking to encourage the prosperity of the Am erican people should protect IP through existing copyright law. Giving
AI a free pass to infringe upon the rights of others who are trying to m ake an honest living practicing their profession is about as
unam erican as it gets. Big tech doesn't have the right to steal the work of others. Period.
