General Comment
The governm ent needs to protect SMALL BUSINESSES from  BIG TECH by preventing these giant tech firm s from  stealing sm all
businesses' and artists' work. Generative AI has yet to actually prove itself useful, which is why they're so desperate to force people to use
it, and now they want to m ake up for its uselessness by hoping that stealing m ore data will m ake it better.
Don't fall for it.
