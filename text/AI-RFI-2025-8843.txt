General Comment
STOP USING AI. PLEASE. AI WILL NOT HELP ANYONE! DATA SCRAPING IS UNFAIR. AI WILL STEAL FROM US
CITIZENS AND PROFITS OFF OF THEFT. NO ONE LIKES AI. IT WILL ONLY DO MORE HARM WITH
MISINFORMATION IN THE INTERNET AND TAKING MORE JOBS FROM THE US CITIZENS. YOU'LL DESTROY
YOUR OWN COUNTRY IF YOU LET AI TAKE OVER MORE JOBS.
