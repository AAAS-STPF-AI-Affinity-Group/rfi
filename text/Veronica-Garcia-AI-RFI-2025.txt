Veronica Garcia, 
I am Vero nica Garcia, a senior at Avonworth High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I 
studied g enerative AI and its impact in the classroom, speciﬁcally in English as a Second 
Language education for two months in a course on AI and Ethics this year. I be lieve this 
administration’s viewpoint on A.I. is too liberal in its deregulation. I believe an emerging 
industry must be carefully monitored while not stiﬂing innovation. This delicate balance is 
possible, though, the administration’s attitude towards the  AI industry indicates this 
balance cannot be reached. The complete deregulation of the emerging industry in hopes of inspiring innovation is completely reckless. Regulation is necessary for nurturing an industry in its infancy. Complete deregulation risks fostering malevolence, misuse of this 
new technology, and emerging monopolies. Additionally, student’s ability to freely access AI is alarming. Generative AI, speciﬁcally, is most prominent in schools. Generative AI is not inspiring innovative thinkers and productivity in our students but rather teaching students to over -rely on this powerful technology. This in turn is hindering student’s intellectual 
capabilities and development. Student’s freely accessing generative AI is detrimental to the 
future of o ur country. This administration has to work to address these concerns for their 
future implications.
