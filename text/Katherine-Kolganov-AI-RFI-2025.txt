Hello,
As a person firmly supportive of the human experience and of humanity's rights, I strongly
oppose this proposal that will grant AI free reign to prey on all of our creations. It has alreadyhad a significantly detrimental effect on many people's lives and honestly, limited beneficialeffects for the majority of society.
A service with benefits few does not deserve immunities from culpability for crimes of theft
(which is all that "Generative AI" amounts to). Please reconsider continuing to allow thethieves who created this monstrosity to get away with their deeds.
Sincerely,K Kolganov
