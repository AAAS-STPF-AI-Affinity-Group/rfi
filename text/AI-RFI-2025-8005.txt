General Comment
AI is an im perfect tool that only takes what others have m ade and regurgitates it for som eone else to call their own. Its is incredibly
inaccurate, m ost Google searches using AI are a prim e exam ple. Using it for voices is dangerous and another m ethod to underpay talent.
Art AI is theft, plain and sim ple.
If AI is allowed a larger role in governm ent then we'll be chasing down falsehood after falsehood with no accountability. But you already
let one m oron with AI into our private data so why don't you take a closer look at what you know who is getting out of his "supposed"
role.
