General Comment
I'm  a photographer, long tim e editor on Wikipedia and write stories in m y free tim e.
Assertions from  artificial intelligence operations, such as OpenAI and Google, that they are entitled to use anything they collect, including
works protected by US copyright are at odds with long standing United States law surrounding copyright and the rights of individuals
m aking creative works. 
They have been open with their intent to underm ine the econom ic opportunities of individuals and groups who m ake creative works, which
com pletely destroys any argum ent that their collection and use of copyrighted works is protected under 'fair use', com bined with the
insistence of having entire works for processing into their black boxes.
As an individual who has provided substantial am ounts of work editing Wikipedia under a creative Com m ons license, I do not believe that
the term s of those open licenses are being com plied with by these firm s, regarding attribution, and I see no indication that it will change
going forward.
Allowing them  to have unfettered usage of works protected by copyright would in effect m ake copyright worthless, particularly to
individuals and sm aller creative firm s and result in a catastrophic decline in creative works due to the inability to create and release a work
without it being taken and used without consent.
