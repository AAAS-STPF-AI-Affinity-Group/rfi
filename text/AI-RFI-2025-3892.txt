General Comment
It is ludicrous to consider that this use of stealing works for large training data sets by corporations who intend to m ake m oney off of it is
som ehow a fair use given the history of fair use in the United Stares. Sim ply farcical. It goes against all established copyright law. 
Also: I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft. It
discourages the creation of new work and turns art into an ouroboros defecating out AI art and then eating it own feces, over and over
again until art deteriorates into nothing but feces. It is already destroying references in search online.
Also, AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. Nobody wants this except short-sighted executives who do not
understand this work is not only ultim ately unprofitable in the long run (they do not understand the long term , only the next quarter, as
shown by their idiotic actions) but also destructive to art and hum an knowledge as a whole.
