General Comment
Training generative AI and LLMs does not adhere to copyright law and cannot fall under the Fair Use Doctrine. There is no way to trace
attribution and there is no way to guarantee that m aterials produced by generative AI and LLMs adhere to Fair Use, especially when the
m aterials produced by generative AI and LLMs are used for com m ercial purposes. Stochastic m odels of language and art cannot provide
enough original content to prove a distinction between am algam ation of others' intellectual property and original work that synthesizes
disparate sources into a new intellectual property.
