General Comment
The m om ent protections are rem oved from  people's creations, is the m om ent you sam e idiots lose too. Im agine the lawsuits. Im agine DC
suing you because you think Batm an is free gam e. No large com pany should rightfully want anything to do with AI slop. It takes their own
IP protections away.
