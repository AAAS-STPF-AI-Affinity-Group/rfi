One barrier to American leadership in AI that I foresee is a population that has no idea how it works 
but still believes everything it says. This plan should include an education aspect. If not directly 
funded with federal dollars, the administration shoul d do as much as possible to incentivize states 
to educate our children on how AI works. Bring in experts. Develop a curriculum that breaks things 
like large language models and neural networks down to terms simple enough for first -graders to 
understand. Th is needs to be learned well before college and maybe even before high school. High 
schools used to have auto -shop as a class. Kids would graduate knowing the basics of how their 
car works and how to maintain it. Back then, a car was a dangerous thing in th e hands of a high -
school kid until they knew how to use it. AI needs to be treated in a similar manner. I'd say it's an 
even more dangerous thing to a 13 year old with an iPhone unless they understand how the 
information they receive from AI is being gener ated. It's one important aspect to build out 
infrastructure and concentrated industry expertise now, but if a generation of American kids grow 
into that infrastructure and aren't educated on at least the basics then it won't be "American 
Leadership" in AI. .. it will be "A few American corporations and their cronies" leading AI.
