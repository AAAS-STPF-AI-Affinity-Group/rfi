Recom m endations for the AI Action Plan


Recommendations for the AI Action Plan  
By Miryan Nogueira, LLB, MBA, LLM  
Business Law Professor & Experienced Business Executive  
As an experienced business law professor, entrepreneur, and executive, I strongly 
advocate for an AI Action Plan that fosters innovation, protects competitive markets, and ensures ethical and responsible AI deployment. To secure and enhance America’s leadership in AI, the following key policy actions should be prioritized:  
1. Promote Pro -Business AI Regulations
•Establish a regulatory framework that encourages AI innovation while avoiding excessive red
tape that could stifle growth.
•Develop industry -led standards that balance ethical AI practices with the need for
technological advancement.
•Ensure that AI -related regulations do not disproportionately burden startups and small
businesses, which are essential drivers of innovation.
2. Incentivize AI Research & Development (R&D)
•Increase federal funding for AI R&D, particularly in industries critical to national security,
healt hcare, and finance.
•Offer tax incentives for businesses that invest in AI development, infrastructure, andworkforce training.
•Strengthen public -private partnerships to accelerate AI advancements and maintain U.S.
dominance in the global AI race.
3. Streng then Intellectual Property (IP) Protections for AI Innovations
•Ensure strong patent protections for AI -driven innovations to encourage entrepreneurship
and investment.
•Address legal ambiguities in AI -generated intellectual property to protect inventors and
businesses.
•Establish a specialized AI patent review system to prevent overly broad or ambiguous AI -
related patents from stifling competition.
4. Develop AI Workforce & Education Initiatives
•Implement nationwide AI literacy programs to prepare the workforce for AI -driven industries.
•Encourage AI integration in business, law, and STEM curricula to create a pipeline of skilledAI professionals.
•Provide grants and funding for workforce retraining programs that help displaced workerstransition into AI -related jobs.
•Substantially fund community colleges to train staff and develop AI -focused curricula,
ensuring accessible education and workforce training for individuals who have lost jobs due


to AI- driven automation.  This investment will equip displaced w orkers with the skills 
necessary to transition into AI -specialized jobs and strengthen the U.S. workforce.  
5. Ensure AI is Used Responsibly & Ethically
•Support the development of ethical AI guidelines that protect consumer rights and prevent
discriminatory  practices.
•Promote AI transparency and accountability by requiring businesses to disclose AI decision-
making processes where applicable.
•Establish a legal framework for AI liability to determine responsibility for AI -driven decisions
in business, healthcare, and other sectors.
6. Secure AI Infrastructure & National Security Interests
•Invest in cybersecurity measures to protect AI systems from foreign adversaries and cyber
threats.
•Strengthen export controls on AI technologies that could be exploited by foreign competitors.
•Promote collaboration between government agencies and private sector leaders to ensure AIsecurity aligns with national interests.
7. Facilitate AI Adoption Across Industries
•Provide grants and incentives to encourage AI adoption in indus tries like manufacturing,
healthcare, and finance.
•Support small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) in integrating AI technology through
government -backed resources and training.
•Encourage responsible AI adoption in the legal and business sectors to impro ve efficiency
and economic competitiveness.
Conclusion  
AI is the future of economic growth, national security, and technological leadership. A 
well-crafted AI Action Plan must balance regulatory oversight with business -friendly 
policies to ensure the U.S. remains at the forefront of AI innovation. By fostering investment, strengthening IP protections, promoting AI workforce development —
including substantial funding for community colleges —and ensuring responsible AI use, 
the United States can solidify its position as the global leader in artificial intelligence.  
The private sector, academia, and policymakers must work together to create an AI framework that empowers businesses, strengthens national security, and maximizes economic opportunities. Now is the time to lead boldly in AI —our global leadership 
depends on it.  
Respecfully,
