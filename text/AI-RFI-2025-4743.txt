General Comment
* I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
* AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
* The prospects of AI are overtly sensationalized and praised, and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. All generative AI aim s to
do is pilfer from  already existing works, generating an inferior product, m aking hum anity feeble, incom petent, and robbing Am ericans of
jobs and the desire or passion to work.
