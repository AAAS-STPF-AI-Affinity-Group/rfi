General Comment
AI SUCKS!! It is actually starting to create convincing pictures for ads, books and anim ations. It also can write flawless 50 page essays
in m inutes. Except they aren’t flawless. AI doesn’t bother to check if the inform ation it got from  scanning the web is true or not. If
som eone m ade a joke post about George Washington saying he had 52 wives, and that was the first thing AI found when looking for facts
about George Washington for Tim m y’s college essay, it’s gonna put that in. Tim m y is screwed. Also, som e people who anim ate/draw for
their jobs are getting laid off by the hour because “AI can m ake it faster” or “AI is m ore reliable.” As a person who m akes art I can
confirm  that it sucks to see AI m aking better art than you can. The only question is, is it actually better….? 
No. That’s the whole reason I wrote this. You, as a person, can create, write, and im agine AS. A. PERSON. AI will never be able to do
that.
