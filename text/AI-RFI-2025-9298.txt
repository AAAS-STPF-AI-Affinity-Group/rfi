General Comment
This proposal would give AI com panies an outsized ability to steal peopleâ€™s data without com pensation and use it for their own profit. This
is not only m orally and ethically dubious, it represents a m assive invasion of privacy and copyright law. Tech elites should not be able to
steal and freely use work of artists, writers, engineers, or others who do not consent to their work being used. Especially when it is used
to generate a profit for private individuals. That is blatant corruption and any m ovem ent in this direction will be beaten down in the courts.
