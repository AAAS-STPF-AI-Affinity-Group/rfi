General Comment
This executive order and AI Action Plan will be detrim ental to any sort of intellectual property, be it art, m usic, literature, m ovies, or
gam es. If anything can be used in AI training sets without regard for ownership and copyright, then effectively nothing has copyright
protection. This is harm ful to not only individual artists and other creators, but entire industries.
