General Comment
If we as a society allow this to pass, we set a precedence as a com m unity that theft is a viable m ean to prosperity. More im portantly, this
breeds distrust into a society that already distrusts our country. We cannot sacrifice our m orality that we pride ourselves in representing
for the sake of technological developm ent. The m ark of a great nation is to achieve our goals because we defend the rights of our people,
not in exchange of them .
