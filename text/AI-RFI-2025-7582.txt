General Comment
AI is a m assive scam  perpetrated by con artists in Silicon Valley upon the world. They want us to believe they have a m iracle cure-all in
the form  of an intelligent m achine. What they actually have is an advanced predictive text like the technology that m akes suggestions every
tim e you type on your phone. There is no intelligence there, only very advanced association predictions. This is why AI constantly
“hallucinates” fictional content—because their entire purpose is to produce text that seem s plausible, not to produce truth. No m atter how
advance this behavior becom es, they rem ain a dum b m achine, not a panacea for all problem s. OpenAI wants perm ission to steal from
m illions of artists, writers, scientists, and private citizens to m ake their fraud m ore convincing—but it will change nothing. You cannot
perm it this m assive wide-scale plagiarism  as it will only further their scam , doing irreparable harm  for every system  and job we replace
with these dum b m achines that pretend to be sm art.
