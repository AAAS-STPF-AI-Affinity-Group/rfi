Subject: Proposal to Adopt CodeW alker for Visualizing Government W aste
Dear DOGE team ,
I love the work youand President Trump are doing to slash federal spending and save 
taxpayers’ money. I have a tool that will help you do this more efficiently —it’s called 
CodeWalker. CodeW alker was designed to visualize and manage the vast amounts of 
code .
Why CodeW alker?
CodeWalker isn't just another visualization tool; it's a revolutionary platform that 
redefines how we interact with and understand complex data sets:
Dynamic Visualization: The software supports both 2D and 3D visualizations, which 
can be parti cularly useful in presenting complex data in an accessible format to 
stakeholders, whether in meetings or public briefings. Imagine being able to walk 
through a 3D model of financial transactions, pinpointing wasteful spending in real -time.
Cryptocurrenc y Transaction Tracking : Given the unique challenges posed by 
cryptocurrencies, CodeWalker's ability to trace transactions, track crime funds, and map 
criminal associations ensures we can follow the money trail with unprecedented clarity. 
This is especially pertinent as we aim to uncover and address instances of waste in 
digital currency transactions by government entities.
Practical Application:
Visualizing Waste: We can use CodeWalker to create visual maps of where and how 
government funds are being mi sallocated or wasted. Dependency tracking and 
relationship mapping will allow us to see the connections between different funds, 
projects, or departments, highlighting inefficiencies.
Public Accountability: By providing clear, interactive visual data, Code Walker can 
help in making government spending more transparent to the public, fostering trust and 
accountability.
Educational Tool: For internal training, CodeWalker can serve as an educational 
platform where new analysts can learn to navigate complex fi scal data sets through its 
backward and forward navigation features.
Implementation and Support:


We are committed to ensuring a smooth transition to CodeWalker. Our team will provide 
comprehensive training, and we have access to ongoing support from CodeWalker's 
developers for any custom needs or updates specific to our use case.
In conclusion, adopting CodeWalker will not only enhance your capability to under stand 
and manage government waste but will also set a new standard in data visualization for 
public sector accountability. We believe this tool is exactly what ’s needed to bring 
transparency and efficiency to the forefront.
I would love the opportunity t o show you how CodeWalker can help you. Please let me 
know when we can schedule a demonstration!
