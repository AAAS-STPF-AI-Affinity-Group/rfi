General Comment
AI is already threatening to replace m y job as an artist and a creative in general, and this is only going to m ake that worse. This AI
garbage is theft on an unprecedented scale and this is going to straight up legalize it, it cannot be allowed to go though. For god's sake
please don't let this go through, do your job please, artists and writers are counting on you. I've already contem plated killing m yself
m ultiple tim es over getting replaced by this stuff, please don't let it happen, it's one of the only things I have left quite frankly
