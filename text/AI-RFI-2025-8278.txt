General Comment
Artificial Intelligence in the case of Generative AI cannot be considered Fair Use, and therefore cannot use copyrighted m aterials. The
reason for this is that the works generated using AI intend to be in direct com petition with the works they are deriving them selves from .
Thus Generative AI should not be allowed to train itself on copyrighted m aterials.
