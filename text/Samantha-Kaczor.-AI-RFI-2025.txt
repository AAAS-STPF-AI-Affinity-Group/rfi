Hello,
My name is Samantha Kaczor. I am an artist. I did not spend decades honing my skills and
craft so a corporation can steal my thousands of hours of work and use it as they see fit. Eachwork I create is a culmination of twenty years of careful practice and hours of labor. To havean artificial intelligence system take that and use it is a slap in the face. Do not let OpenAIfreely use works in their training model.
