Im ok with being a leader in modern technology but not at the expense of human sovereignty. The AI 
should be helpful to humans but not be given the ability to override human direction or esteem 
themselves better than humans. The AI should not be given the abilty to independent decision 
making that affects human lives and should have protocols and be programmed to maintain human 
life as sacred.
