General Comment
Hey, as a creative this will be absolutely horrible for m y industry and the industry of m y friends and peers.
It has been proven tim e and tim e again that AI sim ply cannot m im ic hum an art fully, no m atter how m uch you train it. 
It is unfair and unlawful for other people to be forced to have their art scraped by AI and then lose out on every future opportunity to
work because of that.
Also, AI is really not that groundbreaking or helpful. It's being used to m ake every aspect of norm al life m ore tedious, im personal, and less
hum an. There are so m any things to invest in that could actually m ove hum anity forward, WITHOUT burning up the planet too.
Do not pass this, under ANY circum stances.
