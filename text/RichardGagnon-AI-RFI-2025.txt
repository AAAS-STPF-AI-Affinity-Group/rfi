Before AI companies are freed from copyright infringement uses, they should be required to maintain logs
of the sources used in their AI creations. For AI to create anything, it must draw from the copyrightedinformation scraped to train it. The AI currently has no real intelligence. It is not trained in art or writing theway a human is. That's why AI can produce realistic images of people with six fingers. Even a small childknows there are five fingers even if drawn as five sticks. The AI is taking a copyrighted image(s) from itsdata base and creating something only marginally new with the work of real humans. The copyrighteddata the AI is drawing from can be documented to help determine if the AI product is original.
