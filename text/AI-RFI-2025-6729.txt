General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US.
AI steals from  m any people's livelihoods as an Am erican and profits off of theft.
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public.
AI should not be used for creative purposes. AI is som ething that should be used purely for scientific and m edical purposes, not for
creating m usic, art, or as actors. 
AI is a technology that is a passing trend used as is, when it com es to creativity. Once the trend passes, the m oney that will be m ade from
it will not recuperate the m oney spent, the resources spent, nor will it recover the relationships m ade with artists, m usicians, and actors in
the attem pt to replace them  with it.
