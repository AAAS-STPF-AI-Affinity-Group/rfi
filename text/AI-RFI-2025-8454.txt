Re: Nat ional Science Fo undation’s Request for Information on t he Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan
I am a web de veloper with a pass ion for both tec hnology and art.
Generative AI is a scam t hat has infringed on t he cop yright of everyone from- small artists to large media corporat ions. They should not be 
granted any cop yright exemptions. This technology has already been used to create illegal, obsce ne imagery such as c hild sexual abuse. It 
will only undermine artists’ ab ility to be ab le to make a living while draining money and reso urces at ta xpayers’ e xpense.
Thank you for the opport unity to co mment on these importa nt issues.
