RE: Response to Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial  
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,088 (Feb. 6, 2025) (Docket No. NSF -
2025- 02305)  
Dear Dr. Panchanathan,  
The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office (NCO), National Science Foundation (NSF), on behalf of the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), solicited input specifically from Tribal Nations on the 
Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan.
1  We applaud NSF and OSTP for 
proactively seeking the input of Tribal Nations and recognizing that the 574 federally recognized Tribal Nations can both benefit from AI and play a vital role in advancing America's leadership in this field.
Founded in 1944, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) is the oldest, largest, 
and most representative organization dedicated to advancing the interests of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) Tribal Nations and communities. NCAI established th e Institute 
for Environmental Sovereignty (IES) to, among other things, safeguard Indigenous cultural heritage and advance innovative Indigenous -led approaches to environmental protection.  
Along with other units of NCAI that address AI issues in Indian Country , IES investigates how 
critical technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance Tribal  environmental 
management, addressing both the opportunities and challenges related to sovereignty  and 
cultural relevance.
 The Center for Tribal Digital Sovereignty (the Center) is the nation’s firs t  
1 90 Fed. Reg. 9,088 (Feb. 6, 2025) (“OSTP and NITRD NCO seek input from the public, including from academia, industry 
groups, private sector organizations, state, local , and tribal governments , and any other interested parties, on priority actions  
that should be included in the Plan.”) (emphasis added).

center dedicated to helping Tribal governments navigate digital sovereignty, offering resources and expertise to 
assert Tribal rights in the digital age.2 rights in the digital age.3  The NCAI Technology Task Force plays a key role 
in shaping AI policies by advocating for solutions that make AI technologies accessible and beneficial to Tribal  
communities while upholding and respecting their sovereignty.  
NCAI ’s Tribal government members  established a clear position on Tribal digital sovereignty through multiple 
resolutions, including NC -24-0084 "Supporting Tribal Digital Sovereignty as an Exercise of Self -Determination," 
which builds upon previous resolutions PDX -11-0345, ANC- 22-0106, SAC -22-0167, and SAC- 22-0268. These 
resolutions collectively assert:  
1.Tribal Nations possess inherent sovereign rights to enforce their digital sovereignty standards on AI data
usage.
2.AI technologies must not circumvent Tribal Nation data collection protocols or violate Tribal sovereignty
principles.
3.All data collection, management, and ownership regarding Tribal communities must comply with standards
established by Tribal laws and policies, including safety, security, and resiliency requirements.
4.Tribal Nations maintain authority to:
●Determine parameters and scope of data collection
●Assert ultimate ownership over data collected from their citizens
●Require non -Tribal entities to comply with Tribal law, protocols, and digital standards

5.As sovereigns, Trib al Nations have rights to determine ownership, access, use, and management of data
derived from their citizens, including demographic, anthropological, archaeological, environmental, public
health, genomic, medical, and traditional knowledge data, as well as proxy data and data obtained throughthird
-party AI tools.
6.When a Trib al Nation  lacks specific data governance laws, non -Tribal entities must:
●Obtain formal, enforceable Tribal consent early in the research process
●Provide ongoing opportunities for Tribal input throughout data collection efforts
●Respect Tribal authority throughout the applicable data lifecycle
●Uphold Tribal rights to refuse/withdraw consent and participation (including data removal)
In response to NSF’s solicitation for input on the AI Action Plan, we identify several opportunities for federal policy 
on AI to leverage Tribal Nations’ unique contributions while fulfilling the U.S. government's trust responsibility to 
Tribal  Nations.   The unique political and legal relationship that Tribal Nations share with the United States is rooted 
in the inherent sovereignty of Tribal Nations, recognized in the U.S. Constitution, treaties, and  many federal  statutes , 
regulations, and policies .9  The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently recognized and upheld the distinct legal and 
political status of Tribal Nations and their citizens and communities.   This important and enduring  federal trust 
relationship and responsibility,  also based in federal Indian law,  treaties, statutes, and court decisions, forms the 
basis of the following recommendations in support of advancing U.S. interest in and dominance of AI and other 
emerging technologies so critical to our national security and economic prosperity.1  NCAI offers the following 
recommendations in response to NSF's request and stated commitment to respect the sovereignty and self -
governance of American Indian/Alaska Native Tribal Nations.1 
9 Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 553, n. 24 (1974) (BIA employment preference for qualified Indians “is political, rather 
than racial in nature”). Any misclassification of AI policies and programs as “DEI” would severely undermine the federal trust 
responsibility  and have a wide -ranging negative impact s both  on Tribal Nations  and those programs .

Overarching Recommendations:  
In alignment with Executive Order 14179’s goal of removing barriers to American leadership in AI, NCAI  offers 
recommendations that will ensure AI policies recognize and uphold Tribal Nations' digital sovereignty, self -
determination, and data governance rights.   The Center for Tribal Digital Sovereignty is poised  to serve as a vital 
resource for the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the National Science Foundation , should our 
goals align  in implementing these recommendations.  To further advance these goals, NCAI proposes the following 
nine actionable policy recommendations for the AI Action Plan:  
A.Recognize Tribal Digital Sovereignty to Protect Tribal Rights in AI Policy
"Digital Sovereignty" refers to Tribal Nations' inherent right to control their digital assets, data, and technological 
infra structure.   The amicus brief of NCAI and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in the Alario case 
(attached) provides an expert and comprehensive expression of Tribal Digital Sovereignty, highlighting how Montana's TikTok ban infringed upon Tribal sovereignty and jurisdiction.
10  This case emphasizes the importance 
of clear legal recognition of Tribal data governance rights.  As summarized on page 2 of these Comment s, NCAI 
has adopted formal resolutions  that both recognize Tribal sovereignty over data in digital spaces and protect data 
sovereignty against irresponsibly designed AI tools that bypass Tribal Nations' established data protocols.11 
The collection and use of data from Indian Country through administrative processes, such as federal grant 
applications, raises significant concerns. Routine data collection —like mapping and household demographics —can 
lead to intrusive surveillance of Tribal communities when processed by AI systems.   Federal agencies, as well as 
any associated parties such as grantees and contractors, must be mandated to obtain explicit Tribal consent for any data utilized in AI development.  Policies should absolutely prohibit the secondary use of administratively collected 
Tribal data for AI training without the prior informed and obtained consent from affected and involved Tribal 
Nations.  
Furthermore, Resolution #NC- 24-008
12 supports the recognition of this sovereignty, which would remove barriers 
such as legal complexities, data misuse concerns, and limited resources hindering Tribal participation in AI development.  Strengthening data sovereignty protections builds trust and enhances the AI ecosystem.  We see a 
powerful example in the European Union ’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR ), which fosters 
accountability and promotes a secure, transparent AI landscape. Policy actions include:

1. Establishing clear federal guidelines recognizing Tribal data governance rights  
2. Establishing clear, consent- driven processes for Tribal governments to manage how their data is used in AI 
development, ensuring robust protections against unauthorized use and upholding Tribal Nations' authority 
over their digital assets  
3. Providing legal clarity on intellectual property protections for Tribal data and knowledge13,14 
 
B. Address Limited Tribal Data Representation to Improve AI Systems  
 Each Tribal Nation possesses unique characteristics, with inherent dissimilarities between and among the 574 
federally recognized Tribal Nations. While AI systems learn from massive amounts of data, the contribution of data 
from Indian Country is markedly small, limiting the accuracy and effectiveness of AI applications.
15  An analogy 
would be extrapolating from a limited dataset on the seventeenth - and eighteenth -century Dutch Republic  to make 
broad assumptions that modern European culture, from Norway to Greece, is characterized by windmills, tulip fields, and klompen. 
The use of AI is fundamentally suspect when representing Native peoples, consistently misrepresenting Tribal 
Nations' rich cultural patrimony without proper context or consent.
16  Google Gemini's high- profile failures 
demonstrate how even well- meaning companies go catastrophically wrong without Tribal Nations' active 
involvement in AI development.17  These failures harm America's cultural heritage and lead to significant economic 
costs.  For example, project delays can result in millions of dollars in lost revenue and hinder technological 
advancements.  Additionally, consumer backlash —such as negative public reactions to companies that mishandle 
sensitive data —can damage a company’s reputation and lead to stock devaluation .  These effects extend to all 
Americans, causing market inefficiency, eroding trust in technology, and burdening taxpayers with the cost of remediation efforts.   Policy actions include: 
 
1. Supporting data collection initiatives that properly represent Tribal diversity18,19 
2. Establishing standards for detecting and mitigating AI misrepresentations of Tribal communities

3. Developing frameworks for ethically incorporating Tribal perspectives in AI training data20 
4. Creating oversight mechanisms to evaluate AI systems that purport to represent Native peoples  
5. Requiring Tribal experts to review AI applications to verify historical accuracy, proper context, and 
appropriate representation before deployment in systems affecting Tribal communities21 
 
C. Strengthen  Tribal Consent Processes for Efficient Data Utilization  
 
Uncertainty around proper Tribal data usage by researchers, companies, and agencies hinders innovation while 
risking unauthorized access to sensitive information.  Clear authorization processes would accelerate AI 
development while protecting Tribal rights. NCAI Resolution #SAC -22-02622 specifically addresses how emerging 
technologies like AI can "circumvent Tribal data collection protocols" without proper consent.   The Resolution 
highlights concern about automated systems extracting data from Tribal citizens without ensuring they have a clear 
understanding of future uses of that data —directly violating fundamental American principles of property rights, 
informed consent, and self -determination.  
There are valid concerns about federal agencies or private entities developing AI systems that appropriate data belonging to Tribal Nations.  This is an abomination and should be expressly prohibited.  These practices can 
constitute copyright infringement or unauthorized collection. Unauthorized harvesting of Tribal data —such as 
traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, and community -generated content— violates Tribal sovereignty and 
intellectual property rights.   NCAI wishes to inform the federal partners involved in AI that Tribal Nations would 
likely treat such actions like any other violative theft, and  would likely avail themselves of all governmental and 
legal means of protecting themselves, their communities, and citizens in such situations.   
Thus, the AI Action Plan should include strong provisions prohibiting the scraping, mining, or other non -consensual 
extraction of Tribal data for AI development, along with effective enforcement mechanisms that impose civil and criminal penalties for violations.   Policy actions include: 
 
1. Developing standardized, efficient consent protocols grounded in best practices for Indigenous Data Governance  
2. Establishing clear prohibitions against repurposing data collected from Tribal communities  intended for 
grant administration or determining program eligibility, for AI training or development without explicit, 
informed consent from relevant Tribal governments  
3. Developing secure data sharing frameworks that protect sensitive information while enabling innovation, such as the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) All of Us secure data enclave model (which NCAI Resolution #ABQ -19-061
23 identified as requiring Tribal oversight) and monitored computing

environments like those described in the AI Now Report that restrict data extraction while enabling 
collaborative research  
4. Establishing expedited review processes for AI projects with Tribal data components that respect tribe -
specific protocols while utilizing common frameworks developed by the Center for Tribal Digital 
Sovereignty to accelerate responsible innovation  
 
D. Enhancing and Prioritizing  Government -to-Government Consultation with Tribal 
Nations  
 
Slow- moving, inefficient, and often stonewalling federal bureaucracies create significant barriers for Tribal Nations 
to engage in meaningful consultation, leading to delays and poorly planned projects that often end in litigation. 
Enhancing and providing top prioritization of  these processes would accelerate AI deployment, respect Tribal 
sovereignty, and reduce costly legal disputes.   Policy actions include: 
 
1. Creating dedicated fast -track consultation channels for AI initiatives that build upon established 
consultation frameworks24 
2. Establishing clear timelines for Tribal input on AI policies consistent with government -to-government 
relationship principles  
3. Developing efficient dispute resolution mechanisms for AI -related concerns, inspired by models like the 
Native American Rights Fund’s (NARF) integration of traditional practices with legal frameworks and 
the GDPR , ensuring culturally relevant, sovereign solutions to technology conflicts25 
 
E. Overcome Barriers to AI Adoption by Investing in Strategic Infrastructure 
Development in Indian Country  
 
Investing in AI infrastructure in Indian Country offers a transformative opportunity to empower Tribal Nations 
while strengthening U.S. AI competitiveness.   With one in three Native Americans lacking reliable internet access 
and Tribal businesses serving as some of the largest employers in rural areas, AI infrastructure can bridge significant 
gaps in connectivity, job creation, and economic growth.26  However, it is critical to prioritize responsible siting of 
data centers and AI- related facilities, as these can have negative environmental impacts, including excessive water

and land use, and high energy consumption, which could place unnecessary strain on Tribal resources.27  Early 
Tribal input in planning is essential to address these concerns and prevent legal delays.  By integrating sustainable 
practices from the outset and aligning with Tribal values and long -term stewardship of natural resources, these 
projects can minimize negative impacts and ensure these resources are safeguarded.  
 
Like the many internet and technology -based economies in our natio n and worldwide , AI-driven businesses could 
be a “game changer” in the maze of geopolitical and socioeconomic challenges of Tribal economies.  Tribal 
governments are often hampered by limited taxing authority, reducing revenue that could be reinvested to support 
aspiring entrepreneurs and Tribal start -ups.  By fostering AI- driven industries, Tribal Nations can gain control over 
their own data and resources, creating jobs, stimulating local economies, and unlocking significant economic 
potential.   This approach can help establish a sustainable path to economic self -sufficiency, benefiting both Tribal 
Nations and the broader national AI ecosystem. Policy actions include:  
 
1. Allocating resources for high -speed connectivity in Tribal communities, addressing documented 
connectivity gaps28 
2. Creating public -private partnerships for AI computing infrastructure in underserved Tribal areas  
3. Establishing Tribal data centers that contribute to national AI capabilities while preserving Tribal control 
over data, with enhanced consent framework , respect for sovereignty, and public -private partnership 
support  
 
F. Implement Efficient Cultural Protection Mechanisms  
 
The widespread and comical technological cultural appropriation and stereotyping of American Indian and Alaska Native cultures, traditions, and knowledge is simply shameful .  Protecting Indigenous Knowledge (IK) enhances 
the integrity and distinctiveness of American AI innovation by integrating diverse cultural perspectives, ethical principles, and sustainable practices deeply rooted in Indigenous traditions.   This approach not only enriches AI 
development but also ensures that technologies are more holistic and inclusive, reflecting the strength of America’s 
diverse history and culture.  By weaving together Indigenous wisdom with cutting -edge technology, we promote 
both cultu ral preservation and a more robust, innovative AI ecosystem. Policy actions include:  
 
1. Developing guidelines for classifying sensitive cultural information based on research protocols, aligned 
with the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA)  to protect Indigenous knowledge and uphold 
values of freedom, cultural heritage, and religious rights in AI innovation  
2. Creating secure repositories for authorized cultural data that follow sovereignty principles  
3. Establishing protocols for cultural attribution in AI that uphold Indigenous knowledge ownership, ensure proper compensation, and treat IK as intellectual property, preventing exploitation and theft by the less scrupulous tech companies while encouraging t hose that follow these ethical principles

G. Support Strategic Tribal Workforce Development  
 
Expanding the AI -skilled workforce is critical to American competitiveness. Tribal communities represent a 
valuable talent resource, with Native leaders such as Mason Grimshaw and Michael Running Wolf already making 
strides in fields like computer science and artificial intelligence.   This demonstrates the immense potential for 
American AI dominance.29  Indian gaming operations have developed and platformed a skilled professional class 
with expertise in cybersecurity and IT infrastructure who possess valuable skills in network security, data protection, and regulatory compliance.
30  There is a significant opportunity to enhance these capabilities to address broader 
Tribal Digital Sovereignty issues, such as AI implementation and data governance.  Investing in upskilling this 
talent pool could strengthen Tribal Nations' digital sovereignty and contribute to technological advancement in the U.S. Policy actions include:  
1. Investing in targeted STEM education in Tribal communities, addressing documented technology gaps  
2. Creating apprenticeship programs connecting Tribal citizens with AI industries to build capacity  
3. Developing specialized training programs to expand the expertise of existing Indian gaming IT 
professionals into broader digital sovereignty applications  
4. Establishing pathways for Tribal AI entrepreneurs to access capital and markets based on successful models 
in Tribal technology development  
 
H. Develop Balanced Regulatory Approaches  
 Overly restrictive regulations on AI development risk hampering innovation.  A balanced approach would protect 
legitimate Tribal interests while enabling technological advancement.  Policy actions include: 
 
1. Creating regulatory zoning or “ sandboxes ” for AI projects led by Tribal Nations, utilizing Tribal data and 
addressing community needs  to foster innovation, support Tribal businesses with grants, stimulate 
economic growth, and increase federal funding for Tribal Nations and Tribal Colleges and Universities, 
ensuring high return of investment (ROI)  
2. Establishing clear safe harbors for responsible AI development that safeguards Tribal data sovereignty  
3. Developing proportional enforcement mechanisms that protect innovation while addressing documented 
AI risks  
 
I. Incorporate Tribal Security Considerations in National Defense  
 
Tribal lands and data represent strategic national assets, including resources like energy, critical minerals, water 
rights, biodiversity, and unique cultural knowledge.  Incorporating them into security frameworks strengthens 
America's overall AI resilience.  Policy actions include:

1.Establishing government -to-government partnerships that respect Tribal sovereignty while addressing
shared security concerns
2.Developing collaborative cybersecurity initiatives with Tribal governments31
3.Creating information -sharing protocols for threat detection and response consistent with Tribal data
governance strategies32
Conclusion: 
These approaches will help the federal government meet its trust responsibility while promoting technological 
advancement and economic competitiveness as outlined in Executive Order 14179.   The recommended policy 
actions aim to enhance America's global leadership in AI by removing barriers to Tribal Nation participation, expanding the nation's AI capabilities, and unlocking innovations that draw on the talents of a bright Native workforce and  Indigenous knowledge.  
We do not support unchecked AI development; rather, we insist that Tribal Nations must have meaningful influence in shaping and governing AI technologies. This is not about compromise, but about ensuring that any technological advancement fully respects and protects tribal sovereignty, cultural heritage, and data rights. Such protection fulfills 
the United States' non -negotiable obligations under federal trust responsibility and treaty commitments. By 
eliminating participation barriers, we enable Tribal Nat ions to engage with AI according to their values, advancing 
innovation while preserving their sovereign rights.  
NCAI, through its Center for Digital Sovereignty and Institute for Environmental Sovereignty, is committed and 
ready to work with the Trump Administration to develop an AI Action Plan that strengthens America's position as 
the global AI leader while ensuring that the 574 federally recognized Tribal Nations , and their institutions, 
communities, and citizens  can fully participate in and benefit from AI innovation.

INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE1 
Amicus curiae  the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead 
Reservation (“CSKT”) is a federally recognized tribe with approximately 8,000 
enrolled members, 5,500 of which live on the Flathead Reservation. The 
Reservation comprises over 1.2 million acres in the northwestern region of 
Montana. CSKT has an interest in protecting the economic security and health and 
well-being of its citizens and recognizes the importance of digital resources to 
achieving these objectives.  
Amicus curiae  the National Congress of American Indians (“NCAI”) is the 
oldest and largest national organization comprised of Tribal Nations and their citizens. Since 1944, NCAI has advised and educated Tribal Nations , state s, and 
the federal government on a range of issues, including self -government, treaty 
rights, and policies affecting Tribal Nations. NCAI works daily to strengthen the 
ability of Tribal Nations  to ensure the health and welfare of their c ommunities.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  
It is uncontested that Montana’ s TikTok  ban (“ Montana law” or “the Ban”) 
cannot  legally take effect  on Tribal lands in Montana. Indeed, in response to an 
inquiry from the District Court, both parties affirmed that the Ban is not 
enforceable on Tribal lands , as Tribal lands do not fall within the “territorial 
jurisdiction” of Montana  to which the law applies . Tr. of Oct. 12, 2023 Oral Arg. at 
19-22, 45 -47. Despite this acknowledgment , the record shows the Montana law
would likely be  enforced on Tribal lands  in practice , as TikTok users’  locations 
cannot be precisely tracked  through IP addresses. SER-177. Therefore, a user who 
is on T ribal lands , and beyond  the jurisdictional reach  of the State, may 
nonetheless appear to be outside Tribal lands and within the “territorial 
jurisdiction” of Montana . Tr. of Oct. 12, 2023 Oral Arg. at 21 -22. Because of this 
likelihood, TikTok ’s counsel suggested access to TikTok may  be affected  on 
Tribal lands . Id. This imposition of Montana law on Tribal  lands, even if 
inadvertent,  infringes on Tribal sovereignty . Amic i write  to provide context as to 
how the Ban infringes upon  Tribal sovereignty and  on Tribal governments’ interest 
in exercising digital sovereignty  on Tribal lands  without state interference .  
I.The Montana Ban Improperly Imposes Montana’s Civil Regulations
on Tribal Lands and Infringes on Tribal Sovereignty .
It is well established that Tribal Nations were “self -governing political 
communities” long before the establishment of the United States. Denezpi v. 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 9 of 25


United States, 596 U.S. 591, 598 (2022) (citing United States v. Wheeler , 435 U.S. 
313, 322 -23 (1978) ). The policy  that Tribal Nations are separate sovereigns “has 
remained.” Williams v. Lee , 358 U.S. 217, 219 (1959); see 25 U.S.C. § 5301 
(noting the Congressional policy of Tribal Nation “self -government”); Exec. Order 
No. 14, 112, 88 Fed. Reg. 86,02 1 (Dec. 11, 2023) (noting  the policy of protecting 
“Tribal sovereignty and self -determination.”); COHEN 'S HANDBOOK OF FEDERAL 
INDIAN LAW § 1.07 (Nell Jessup Newton ed., 2023).  
As sovereign governments, Tribal Nations have jurisdiction over the 
activities and conduct on “land belonging to the Tribe or held by the United States 
in trust for the Tribe.” Montana  v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 557 (1981) . This 
authority allows Tribal Nations “[t]o determine who may enter the reservation; to 
define the conditions upon which they may enter; to prescribe rules of conduct; 
[and] to expel those who enter the reservation without proper authority.” 
Swinomish  Indian Tribal Cmy. v. BNSF Ry. Co. , 951 F.3d 1142,  1153  (2020)  
(quoting Quechan Tribe of Indians v. Rowe , 531 F.2d 408, 411 (9th Cir. 1976)); see 
also Window Rock Unified Sch. Dist. v. Reeves, 861 F.3d 894, 899 (9th Cir. 2017), 
as amended (Aug. 3, 2017) (“The Supreme Court has long recognized that Indian tribes have sovereign powers, including the power to exclude non-tribal members 
from tribal land.”).  To avoid interference with these sovereign prerogatives, Tribal 
jurisdiction on Tribal lands is assumed to be the exclusion of states. Williams , 358 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 10 of 25


U.S. at 219 -20. Even on non-Indian fee land within a reservation, Tribal Nations 
retain jurisdiction to regulate. See e.g. , FMC Corp.  v. Shoshone -Bannock Tribes , 
942 F.3d 916, 931 (2019) ; Knighton v. Cedarville Rancheria of N. Paiute Indians , 
922 F.3d 892, 899-900 (9th Cir. 2019). Unless and “until Congress acts, the tribes 
retain” their historic sovereign authority. Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty. , 572 
U.S. 782, 788 (2014).  
Tribal Nations ’ exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of their inherent sovereignty  
is reinforced by federal preemption. This includes treaties  with the United States 
that reserve Tribal Nations’ exclusive jurisdiction within their lands. See, e.g. , 
Treaty with the Blackfeet , 1855, art. 4 , 11 Stat. 657 (1855)  
https://treaties.okstate.edu/treaties/treaty-with -the-blackfeet -1855-0736 ; Treaty 
with the Crow Indians, 1868, art. II , 15 Stat. 649 (186 8) 
https://indianlaw.mt.gov/_docs/crow/treaties/1868_treaty.pdf; Treaty of Hell Gate, 
1855 ( Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes), art. 2, 12 Stat. 975  (1855) 
https://www.washingtonhistory.org/wp -
content/uploads/2020/04/hellgateTreaty.pdf . The United States Supreme Court has 
consistently held such “right to exclude” language in Indian treaties vests Tribal 
Nations with civil jurisdiction over members and nonmembers alike and preempts 
exercise of jurisdiction by states. See Williams v. Lee , 358 U.S. 217 (1959); 
McClanahan v. State Tax Comm’n of Ariz. , 411 U.S. 164 (1973); Kennerly v. Dist. 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 11 of 25


Ct. of 9th  Jud. Dist. of Mont. , 400 U.S. 423 (1971); see also  Little Horn State Bank 
v. Stops , 170 Mont. 510 (1976).  
Likewise, the  plain language of the  Montana Enabling Act and the Montana 
Constitution recognize a lack of state jurisdiction over Tribal lands. The Montana 
Enabling Act conditioned entry into the Union upon Montana disclaiming “all right 
and title  . . . to all lands . . . owned or held by any Indian or Indian Tribes.” 
Enabling Act of 1889, 25 Stat. 676 at § 4. To leave no doubt, the Enabling Act 
further provided that Tribal lands would remain under the “absolute jurisdiction 
and control of the Congress of the United States.” Id. The Montana Constitution 
adopted and ratified these terms, including ,  
the agreement and declaration that all lands owned or held by any 
Indian or Indian tribes shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the congress of the United States, continue in full force and 
effect until revoked by the consent of the United States and the people 
of Montana.  
Mont. Const. art. I.  The Montana Supreme Court has also held that the federal 
government and Tribal Nations are the sovereigns that retain jurisdiction over 
Indian country , to the exclusion of states. Big Spring v. Conway , 360 Mont. 370 , 
380 (2011).  Thus, Montana generally has no civil regulatory authority over Tribal 
lands in Montana.  
While Montana may not intend for the Ban to be enforced on Tribal lands, 
the Ban’s enforcement design nevertheless is likely to impose  Montana’s civil 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 12 of 25


regulatory scheme on Tribal lands. Such an imposition exceeds Montana’s 
jurisdiction.  To illustrate , in her declaration, Karen Sprenger , Chief Operating 
Officer of LMG Security , a cybersecurity and information technology consulting 
firm, testified “[A] user in Sidney, Montana, for example, may be identified as 
being in North Dakota, or a user in West Yellowstone, Montana may be identified 
as being in Wyoming. Similarly, a user in Kellogg, Idaho may be identified as 
being in Montana. ” SER-182. The Montana Solicitor General testified the same 
circumstances would pertain to Tribal lands. SER-49. 
Besides the preemptive effect of  treaties and the Montana Enabling Act, 
state exercise of jurisdiction is contrary to the “longstanding policy of encouraging 
tribal self -government  . . . [which]  . . . operates ‘even in areas where state control 
has not been affirmatively pre-empted by federal statute.’” Big Spring , 360 Mont. 
370 at 380 (quoting Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante , 480 U.S. 9 , 14 (1987).  In cases 
where states are found to have jurisdiction in Indian country, courts conclude so 
because of unique circumstances in which they find there is no preemptive federal 
law, there is a lack of Tribal Nations’ and the federal government’s interest in 
encouraging tribal self -government , and the state has a significant interest in 
exercising its regulatory authority in a way that does not infringe upon Tribal self -
government. See White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker , 448 U.S. 136, 144-45 
(1980 ). These conditions are not met here. As described in detail below, Tribal 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 13 of 25


Nations have a significant interest in exercising digital sovereignty on their land s 
to protect the health and welfare of their people. In contrast, Montana has no 
significant interest in imposing its digital and data sovereignty policy preferences 
on Tribal lands.2 Moreover, there is no reason to let Montana’s policy preferences 
override  those  of T ribal Nations. Such  an imposition exceeds Montana’s civil 
regulatory authority and infringes on Tribal sovereignty . 
II. Tribal Nations Exercise Digital Sovereignty for the Health and 
Welfare of Their People.  
The Ban interferes with Tribal Nations’  significant  interest in crafting their 
own policy decisions in the digital and data realm  to protect the health and welfare 
of their people . The federal government has recognized Tribal digital sovereignty 
and closing the “digital divide ” as essential  for the health and welfare of Tribal 
Nations, c alling access to high- speed internet no longer a luxury, but a necessity.

Tribal digital sovereignty is an important and growing component of Tribal 
sovereignty and is critical to close the digital divide and achieve “digital equity” in 
Indian country. Tribal Nations are a necessary regulatory and governmental 
authority in the equitable development of digital infrastructure and economies on 
Tribal land. Tribal Nations exercise their authority to address the unique needs of 
their communities in an increasingly digital society. In 2019, the American Indian 
Policy Institute3 conducted a study surveying the extent of the digital divide in 
Indian country. Davi da Delmar, Indigenous Digital Sovereignty: From the Digital 
Divide to Digital Equity , NATIONAL DIGITAL INCLUSION ALLIANCE  (2023) 
[hereinafter Delmar], 
https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2023/07/19/indigenous -digital -sovereignty/ . 
The study found that 18% of reservation residents have no internet access at home, 
either wireless or land-based internet (cable, DSL, dial- up), and 33% rely on cell 
phone service for at -home internet. Id. A separate study conducted by the Center 
for Indian Country Development at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 
emphasized these inequities.  Anahid Bauer et al., The Tribal Digi tal Divide: Extent 
and Explanations  (2022),  https://www.minneapolisfed.org/-
/media/assets/papers/cicdwp/2021/cicd-wp-2021 -03.pdf . This study found that,

compared to non-T ribal areas, download speeds are approximately 75% slower in 
Tribal areas and “the lowest price for basic Internet service in Tribal areas is 11% 
higher.” Id. These inequities are exacerbated by the fact that Native Americans 
have the highest poverty rate among all demographics . Dedrick Asante -
Muhammad et al., Racial Wealth Snapshot: Native Americans , NCRC (2022), 
https://ncrc.org/racial -wealth -snapshot -native -americans/ . The lack of reliable and 
affordable internet access makes it challenging for Tribal members to fully engage 
in economic and social opportunities necessary to thrive in today’s society. The 
American Indian Policy Institute highlighted that each Tribal Nation experiences 
unique barriers to closing the digital divide and thus it is important for Tribal 
Nations to define their own solutions. Delmar , supra at 8. 
Tribal communities are often located in rural areas, where access to 
broadband and social media apps is vital. Many Tribal Nations have Facebook 
accounts, Instagram accounts, YouTube  accounts, or other social media accounts 
that provide critical information to Tribal communities. See, e.g. , CSKT Facebook 
page , 
https://www.facebook.com/share/8cg6MwvAK9mDKAM3/?mibextid=A7sQZp  
(last visited May 6, 2024) . Whether it is to update members about oncoming severe 
weather, provide information about missing and murdered relatives, preserve 
culture, or simply notify the community about an upcoming Tribal Council 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 16 of 25


meeting, access to these platforms is critical to the health and welfare of Tribal 
Nations. See e.g. , Sara Reardon, Social media helps Native Americans preserve 
cultural traditions during pandemic , CNN (Feb. 29, 2021, 3:25 PM EST), 
https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/08/health/coronavirus -native -americans -i nternet-
khn-wellness- partner/index.html . 
Tribal Nations already exercise authority in this area by building broadband 
infrastructure, providing crucial telehealth, telework, and telelearning opportunities to their members, and protecting private Tribal data.  Traci Morris, Indigenous 
Digital Sovereignty Defined, ASU
 AMERICAN INDIAN POLICY INSTITUTE , 
https://aipi.asu.edu/blog/2023/07/indigenous -digital -sovereignty -
defined#:~:text=Indigenous%20Digital%20Sovereignty%20is%20both,data%2C%
20infrastructure%2C%20and%20networks .  
Tribal Nations have the capability to tackle digital inequity and are the 
proper sovereigns to determine their policies for their communities. A perfect example is the Blackfeet Nation, which established its own corporation, Siyeh 
Communications, to address specific digital equity needs (such as effective and 
reliable broadband access ) for Tribal members and those within its service areas. 
Siyeh Communications’ goal is to manage and upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure to improve the quality of life and create economic opportunities for 
the residents and business within its service area. Siyeh Communications, History 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 17 of 25


of Siyeh Communications , https://www.siycom.com/about . The Blackfeet Nation 
Tribal Chairman Tim Davis described Siyeh Communications’ efforts as “a major 
step in the exercise of the Blackfeet Tribe’s sovereign rights.” Id. The Chairman 
further stated that, Siyeh Communications “gives the Tribe a level of control 
necessary to prioritize and develop modern telecommunications technology on the 
Blackfeet Reservation, especially during a pandemic.” Id. 
It is important to recognize that regulation in the digital realm is not a one 
size fits all. As Tribal Nations lead the effort to strengthen their digital governance, 
they can address the issues most critical to them and formulate policies that are 
best for their communities.  Indeed, across the United States, 49 Tribal Nations 
have enacted Tribal laws relating to Tribal data sovereignty, an important subset of 
digital sovereignty . Angela R. Riley, The Ascension of Indigenous Cultural 
Property Law , 121 Mich L. Rev. 75 (2022). Data is increasingly becoming digitally 
stored and used by third parties, which comes with risks especially understood by 
Tribal Nations who have experienced a long history of unauthorized storage and use of Tribal data and information. See, e.g. , Robyn L.  Sterling , Genetic Research 
among the Havasupai: A Cautionary Tale, AMA
 JOURNAL OF ETHICS  (2011), 
https://journalofethics.ama -assn.org/article/genetic -research -among -havasupai-
cautionary -tale/2011 -02, (Researchers at Arizona State University misappropriated 
blood samples of approximately 100 members of the Havasupai Tribe for research 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 18 of 25


which neither the Tribe nor the member- subjects had provided informed consent to 
conduct ). Responsive to this, Tribal Nations have passed their own regulations 
regarding the use and storage of their data. See, E.g., GRAND TRAVERSE BAND OF 
OTTAWA AND CHIPPEWA INDIANS , MICHIGAN - TRIBAL CODE, Title 12 
https://www.narf.org/nill/codes/grand_traverse/Title_12.pdf ; NAVA JO NATION 
CODE ANNOTATED , N.N.C. Title 13, Ch. 25, § 3252 , https://www.nnols.org/wp-
content/uploads/2022/05/13 -20.pdf  (setting “the conditions under which 
investigators, physicians, researchers and others may perform research activities on 
living human subjects within the territorial jurisdiction of the Navajo Nation.”); see 
also e.g ., CRIT  HUMAN AND CULTURAL RESEARCH  CODE § 1-101(2) , 
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https:/

code to protect citizens’ data, “including physical, real, cultural and intellectual 
property and communal property such as blood and tissue samples from the Tribe 
in large scale human subjects research.”).  
Thus , Tribal Nations, just as Montana, have their own serious concerns 
regarding the gather ing and use of Tribal data by a wide range of companies, 
government agencies, and other actors.  However, implementing these laws is a 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 19 of 25


costly and resource -intensive  endeavor . It requires immense investments in 
broadband infrastructure, network business models, and network technologies . 
Broadband Network Deployment Engineering, an Overview, NTIA 
BROADBAND USA , https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/sites/default/files/2022 -
03/Broadband%20Network%20Deployment%20Engineering%20PDF.pdf. So, for 
instance, while Tribal codes establishing  data privacy laws to protect Tribal 
citizens’  privacy are an important first step in exercising data sovereignty , the 
effective ness of their  implementation, among other data sovereignty laws, often 
depend s upon the collaborati on of states and the federal government . 
Implementing Tribal digital sovereignty overall is strengthened when states, 
the federal government, and Tribal Nations work collaboratively. Already,  we see 
direct and effective partnerships. For example, in California, the digital divide “is 
especially endemic on tribal lands” as “over a quarter of households” lack effective 
and reliable broadband service.  Ben Polsky et al., How California Is Bridging the 
Digital Divide on Tribal Land, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
PEACE , https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/08/28/how-california -is-bridging -
digital- divide -on-tribal -land-pub-90433 . Wildfires and other weather -related issues 
often “disturb the basic communications infrastructure needed to” provide 
emergency services and critical status updates to Tribal populations during 
weather -related disasters. Id. In response, the federal government and California 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 20 of 25


made federal and state funding available directly to Tribal Nations to assist in 
improving this infrastructure. Id. Further, California partnered directly with the 
Hoopa Valley Tribe to construct and bring the state -owned fiber infrastructure 
directly to the Tribe. Id. California acknowledged  that this state -Tribal partnership 
worked to strengthen “the [T]ribe’s self -determination and sovereignty goals of 
providing essential services to its nation.” Id. 
Montana, too, has seen efforts to build up Tribal digital sovereignty and 
address the digital divide.  The federal government, Tribal Nations, and Montana 
came together to discuss how recent federal funding could aid in addressing the 
state’s digital divide.  Envisioning an Equitable, Inclusive, Connected America , 
Montana , National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 
https://www.ntia.doc.gov/report/2024/office -internet-connectivity -and-growth -
2023 -annual -report/implementation -partnering -in-the-field-part -two/states-
territories/montana . Laws like  the Ban are counterproductive to such efforts. 
Because the Ban implicate s various forms of Tribal self -governance , it should be 
aligned with Tribal Nations’ goals so that it is not out of step with measures the 
federal government, states, and Tribal Nations are implementing to strengthen 
Tribal self -governance. Instead, state laws should be designed to support collective 
efforts to bring Tri bal Nations’ regulatory frameworks  in the digital realm to 
reality . State laws that would have the effect of regulating digital or data 
 Case: 24-34, 05/07/2024, DktEntry: 46.1, Page 21 of 25


sovereignty on Tribal lands or within Tribal jurisdictions —whether intentionally or 
inadvertently —have the potential to undermine, rather than help, in this effort.  
To avoid this, state lawmakers must design laws touching issues in the 
digital world carefully, keeping in mind how those laws, and the regulatory 
policies that will devolve from them, implicate Tribal Nations. This includes 
ensuring that state laws will not encroach upon Tribal Nation jurisdiction , 
inconsistent with federal policy of promoting Tribal self -governance . Bracker , 448 
U.S. at 144-45. State lawmakers must also consider the complex circumstances in 
which Tribal Nations operate —such as often being in rural areas and having 
limited visibility by the greater public —to determine if the design of a law may 
violate Tribal jurisdiction.  Montana’s failure to do so here resulted in a law  that 
cannot be implemented without  infringe ment  upon Tribal sovereignty. Not only is 
this precluded by federal and state law, but it is also contrary to the strong interests 
Tribal Nations , states, and the federal government have in strengthening Tribal 
digital sovereignty.  
CONCLUSION  
Tribal digital sovereignty is crucial for Tribal self -governance in today’s 
world. Because the Ban’s  enforcement design is likely to encroach upon the 
jurisdiction of Tribal Nation s in Montana , the Ban is incongruent with state and 
federal law and is contrary  to efforts to strengthen Tribal digital sovereignty .

Resolution #NC-24-008
TITLE: Supporting Tribal Digital Sovereignty as an Exercise of 
Self-Determination
WHEREAS, we, the members of the National Congress of American Indians of 
the United States, invoking the divine blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and 
purposes, in order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the inherent 
sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights secured under Indian treaties and 
agreements with the United States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are 
entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United States and the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten the public toward a 
better understanding of the Indian people, to preserve Indian cultural values, and 
otherwise promote the health, safety and welfare of the Indian people, do hereby 
establish and submit the following resolution; and
WHEREAS, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) was established 
in 1944 and is the oldest and largest national organization of American Indian and 
Alaska Native tribal governments; and
WHEREAS, the inherent sovereignty of Tribal Nations has been recognized and 
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court through its holdings in Worcester v. Georgia 358 
U.S. 217, William v. Lee 31 U.S. 515, and United States v. Wheeler 435 U.S. 313; 
and
WHEREAS, NCAI has passed resolutions PDX-11-034, ANC-22-010, and 
SAC-22-016 supporting the recognition of Tribal sovereignty over data in digital 
spaces to achieve digital equity and digital jurisdiction in Tribal communities and to 
advance self-determination and self-reliance; and
WHEREAS, Tribal Digital Sovereignty is the umbrella term that encompasses 
the exercise of sovereign authority over physical and virtual network infrastructure, 
and the intangible, virtual digital jurisdictional aspects of the acquisition, storage, 
transmission, access, and use of data including policy developments that impact a 
Tribal Nation's digital footprint in both real-world and virtual spaces; and1


National Congress of American Indians | 1516 P St NW, Washington, DC 20005 | (202)  | www.ncai.org
WHEREAS, Tribal Digital Sovereignty encompasses all aspects of a Tribal Nation’s digital plan 
and footprint, such as Tribal codes, managing data protection, digital equity, network infrastructure, 
development of funding sources, education, healthcare, public safety and law enforcement, economic 
and community development, and capacity building; and
WHEREAS, broadband and other modern communications technologies are the 21st century 
platform for tribal self-determination; and 
WHEREAS, the Native American Rights Fund has filed an amicus brief in March 2024, on 
behalf of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and NCAI,   in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit in Alario v. Knudsen, a case concerning the banning of TikTok by the state of Montana, 
which represents an unprecedented incursion on tribal sovereignty and as that amicus brief argues that 
Tribal Digital Sovereignty is crucial to Tribal self-governance, and state laws limiting access to websites 
encroaches on Tribal sovereignty; and
WHEREAS, Congress passed Public Law No. 118-49 in April 2024, which expands the 
definition of “electronic communications service providers” and is very likely to include Tribal entities 
that operate internet and data infrastructure on Tribal lands in warrantless surveillance under the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act, and represents an unprecedented incursion on tribal sovereignty , and on 
June 4, 2024, the expected markup legislative fix proposal was not introduced ; and 
WHEREAS, Congress and state legislatures are considering other measures to regulate virtual 
conduct with no consideration for their impacts on Tribal Digital Sovereignty; and
WHEREAS, Tribal Nations are the necessary regulatory and governmental authorities in their 
development of Tribal DigitalSovereignty and the economies resulting therefrom, and Tribal Nations are 
already exercising their authority to address the unique needs of their communities in an increasingly 
digital society; and 
WHEREAS, NCAI supports the exercise of Tribal Digital Sovereignty through its capacity to 
form subcommittees, pass resolutions, and support policy solutions addressing Tribal Digital 
Sovereignty issues.

National Congress of American Indians | 1516 P St NW, Washington, DC 20005 | (202)  | www.ncai.org
WHEREAS, on June 4, 2024, Arizona State University and NCAI launched a new Center for 
Tribal Digital Sovereignty that is expected to form a new coalition to advance Tribal Digital 
Sovereignty; and 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that NCAI calls upon Federal, State, and local 
governments to recognize Tribal Digital Sovereignty and its crucial role in modern Tribal 
self-governance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that NCAI calls upon Tribal, state, local, and federal 
legislators, regulators, and jurists, and the appropriate law enforcement to respect and enforce Tribal 
Digital Sovereignty; and 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the newly created Center for Tribal Digital Sovereignty  
and its work to create a new coalition be the vehicle for advocacy, analysis, scholarship, and resources 
needed to help Tribal Nations develop their digital environments and exercise their Tribal Digital 
Sovereignty ; and 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that NCAI calls for an immediate fix to P.L 118-49 because as 
the law is currently written it could force Tribal Nations to surveil their own citizens, which  is an affront 
to tribal sovereignty; and
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, that this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI until it is 
withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.

TITLE:  Support for Federal Communications Policy Reform to Strengthen 
American Indian and Alaska Native Self -Determination 
WHEREAS,  we, the members of the National Congress of American Ind ians 
of the United States, invoking the divine blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and 
purposes, in order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the inherent sovereign 
rights of our Indian nations, rights secured under Indian treaties and agree ments with 
the United States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are entitled under the 
laws and Constitution of the United States, to enlighten the public toward a better 
understanding of the Indian people, to preserve Indian cultural values, a nd otherwise 
promote the health, safety and welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and 
submit the following resolution; and  
WHEREAS, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) was 
established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest national  organization of American 
Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments ; and  
WHEREAS,  Native communities are the worst connected communities in the 
United States; and  
WHEREAS , the Federal government and the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) has a trust responsibility to support American Indian tribes and 
Alaska Native villages (AI/AN),  and recognize the unique status and needs of AI/AN ; 
and 
WHEREAS , the FCC is in the process of substantially changing regulatory 
rules for the Universal Service Fund a nd for Inter -Carrier Compensation Rules; and  
WHEREAS , the telecommunications industry has made numerous proposals 
to frame the transition of the Universal Service and Inter -Carrier Compensation 
programs to a new reformed program and to a new Connect Ameri ca Fund, without a 
single reference to or acknowledgement of  AI/AN and their  unique circumstances and 
needs; and  
WHEREAS , A I / A N , NCAI , and tribal organizations  have spoken to the 
Federal government and the FCC on vital policy imperatives on behalf of A I /AN, and 
NCAI must re -state the urgency of securing telecommunications parity with non -
Native communities ; and  
WHEREAS , the NCAI has previously recognized the importance of  tribal 
positions on Universal Service Reform at the 2011 NCAI Mid -Year Conference i n 
Milwaukee, WI through the passage of Resolution #MKE -11-005.  


NCAI 2 011 Annual  Resolution PDX -11-034 
 
Page 2 of 3 NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the NCAI hereby urges that in the 
reform of Universal Service and Inter -Carrier Compensation regulations, and  in the transition 
from Universal Service Fund  to the Connect America Fund that the FCC must honor and respect 
the sovereignty of AI/AN governments and not lose sight of the unique needs of our 
communities; and  
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that NCAI reaffirms Resolution s #MKE -11-004 and 
#MKE -11-005 passed  at the 2011 Mid -Year Conference in Milwaukee, WI, for the creation of a 
‘Native Nations Broadband Fund’ and positions on Universal Service reform that would benefit 
tribes; and  
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that to ensure the sovereignty of AI/AN , the FCC 
shou ld defer to AI/AN governments and allow them to decide which Eligible 
Telecommunications Carrier s (ETC s) can service their lands,  and enforce the principle that no 
ETCs should serve AI/AN lands without obtaining  permission  by the tribal government, 
communi ty, or Alaska Native village ; and  
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the FCC must : 1) support A I / A N  efforts to provide 
their own regulatory service s by removing regulatory barriers and targeting all available federal 
resources and support for tribal effort ; 2) extend a ‘Native Priority ’ to all  communications service 
sectors and provide regulatory support to ‘Native Nations ’ in the promotion of public interest;  3) 
provide support to connect key tribal public and anchor institutions to broadband service ; 4) 
protec t tribal  regulatory and cost based service through a tribal carve  out policy  to sustain current 
infrastructure and future tribal broadband regulatory services; 5)  adopt a Native Broadband 
Lifeline and Linkup program to help low -income tribal consumers who cannot afford broadband 
service to be connected —and benefit from the p romise of universal service; 6) ensure that 
funding for Native communities be allocated according to need, not basing support on the 
cheapest infrastructure proposed or the cheapest area s to serve in Native communities ; 7) take all 
necessary procedures to make spectrum available for tribal communities  to use for public interest 
services and to attain broadband service, applying extraordinary procedures and waiver of 
spectrum rules to prom ote public  interest; and  
 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, when planning the potential right of first refusal by 
price -cap carriers to recede from carrier -of-last-resort obligations in certain rural service areas, 
that the FCC must consult with tribal governments  on the development of procedures and policies  
and require commercial consultation on quality of service between ETC’s and tribes,  and give 
tribes  the first option to serve its own community , or elect an outside ETC to provide service on 
tribal lands ; and  
 
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED , that this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI until it is 
withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.

Resolution #SAC -22-016 
TITLE: Support for Tribes Exercising their Inherent Sovereign Authority Over the 
Activities and Data of their Businesses, Citizens, and Jurisdiction online; and 
Recognition of Tribal Data Sovereignty and Jurisdiction Online  
WHEREAS , we, the members of the National Congress of American Indians of the 
United States, invoking the divine blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the inherent sovereign rights of our 
Indian nations, rights secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United States and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten the public toward a better understanding of the Indian people, to preserve Indian cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, safety and welfare of t he Indian 
people, do hereby establish and submit the following resolution; and 
WHEREA S, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) was established 
in 1944 and is the oldest and largest national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native triba l governments; and  
WHEREAS , U.S. Courts and Federal law currently delineate the jurisdiction of 
Tribal Nations based on physical geography, namely whether lands and activities are on - or 
off-reservation; and  
WHEREAS , these physical distinctions frequently restrict the ability of Tribal 
Nations to compete in the physical marketplace and develop Tribal economies; and  
WHEREAS , the world is transitioning to an increasingly digital format, with 
ecommerce activities outpacing brick and mo rtar transactions for all sectors with 
predictions that digital transactions will account for nearly one -third of all economic 
transactions in the United States within the next five years; and  
WHEREAS , NCAI recognizes that the internet provides vital opportunities for 
remotely located and rurally -situated Tribal Nations to participate in the modern economy 
by creating the opportunity for customers to digitally access on- reservation Tribal services 
and jurisdiction, which serves to diversify and develop Tribal economies and support Tribal self-determination; and  
WHEREAS , NCAI also recognizes that the internet necessarily requires a 
recognition of Tribal data, including its development, uses, and regulation and that respect for Tribal data sovereignty and regulation must include data related to the Tribal Nation, as well as its businesses, citizens, and activities for research, cultural preservation, economic sustainability, and other uses; and  


WHEREAS , Tribal sovereignty and Tribal jurisdiction are being eroded in the digital marketplace 
as Federal agencies, states and private parties fail to recognize Tribal digital sovereignty, specific examples 
include: Tribal Nations utilizing the internet for economic and community development facing legal 
attack s by private plaintiffs and courts ignoring Tribal sovereignty and jurisdiction in online contracting, 
the failure of states and other sister sovereigns to recognize Tribal taxation authority for online transactions conducted by Tribal citizens from Tribal lands,
1 and the failure of Federal and state agencies to recognize 
Tribal data sovereignty in online and digital programs;2 and 
WHEREAS , simultaneous to this disregard of Tribal digital sovereignty by U.S. Courts, federal 
agencies, and states, the United States is aggressively encouraging the development of digital infrastructure 
on reservations and within Tribal communities through billions of dollars in support for Tribal broadband infrastructure development; and  
WHEREAS , Tribal jurisdiction and Tribal sovereignty apply to digital and online transactions and 
t
he collection and use of Tribal data and must be recognized  by Congress, federal agencies,  and states, a s 
well as  public and private institutions; and  
WHEREAS , N CAI has created a Technology Task Force to address issues in the fields of 
technology and communications in Indian Country; and  
WHEREAS , this resolution is consistent with NCAI’s previous efforts and policy to call on the 
federal government to recognize Tribal jurisdiction online and respect Tribal data sovereignty.3 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED , that the National Congress of American Indians 
(NCAI) fully supports the economic and community development opportunities for Tribal Nations provided by the internet  and broadband infrastructure recognizing that, especially, for rurally located tribes, 
the internet is an essential link for tribes to participate in the modern economy; and  
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , NC
AI supports Tribal Nations’ right to assert and protec t their 
Tribal digital jurisdiction and sovereign authority over the data related to their citizens, businesses, and activities online , and that the collection, use, and application is subject to Tribal laws and policies (e.g. 
Data Use Agreements) ; and 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , NCAI  c
alls upon the Administration , including the White House 
Council on Native American Affairs , and Federal agencies to engage in consultations and discussions with 
Tribal Nations  to ensure Tribal digital jurisdiction and data sovereignty, including Tribal Nations’  safety, 
security , and resiliency needs  and priorities,  are acknowledged  and addressed conclusively in Federal 
polici es and actions ; and  
1  See e.g., Arizona applying taxes to online purchases by Tribal citizens from Tribal lands but not 
remitting or reimbursing those taxes to Tribal Nations in opposition to Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Rsrv. , 447 U.S. 134 (1980). 
2 NCAI Resolution #ANC-22-010.  
3 NCAI Resolution #KAN -18-011,  NCAI Resolution #ANC-22-010. 


BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , NCAI assigns to the Technology Task Force a continuing 
obligation t o investigate, inform, guide , and generate strategic insight for subsequent advocacy and 
education, including with the U.S. Congress, public institutions, private corporations, businesses, and 
stakeholders; and 
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED , that this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI until it is 
withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.

Resolution #SAC -22-026 
 
TITLE: Preventing Evasion of Tribal Nation Data Sovereignty in the Health 
Research Sector by Means of Technological Modernization in an Unsettled 
Regulatory Frontier 
  
WHEREAS , we, the members  of the National  Congress of American  Indians of 
the United States, invoking the divine blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and 
purposes, in order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants  the inherent sovereign 
rights of our Indian nations, rights secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are entitled under the laws and Constitution  of the United  States  and the United  Nations Declaration  on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples,  to enlighten the public toward  a better  understanding of 
the Indian  people, to preserve Indian cultural  values,  and otherwise  promote  the health, 
safety  and welfare  of the Indian people, do hereby  establish  and submit the following 
resolution; and 
 
WHEREAS , the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) was 
es
tablished in 1944 and is the oldest and largest national organization of American 
Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments; and 
 
WHEREAS , “data sovereignty” in the context of Tribal Nations and for the 
purposes of this resolution refers to “the right of [each Tribal Nation] to govern the collection, ownership, and application of its own data. It derives from tribes' inherent right to govern their peoples, lands, and resources.”, as defined by the Native Nations Institute;
1 and  
 WHEREAS,  in Reso lution SAC -22-016, Support for Tribes Exercising their 
Inherent Sovereign Authority Over the Activities and Data of their Businesses, Citizens, and Jurisdiction online; and Recognition of Tribal Data Sovereignty and Jurisdiction Online , NCAI formally recog nizes that the prerogatives of Tribal Nations include, 
overseeing data collection, data management, and other practices to safeguard their data; and 
 WHEREAS, the proliferation of data collection by machines and artificial 
intelligence tools warrants assur ance to Tribal Nations that such technologies will not 
circumvent their own data collection protocols and shall not violate principles of tribal sovereignty; and 
 WHEREAS, to the extent Federal agencies  rely on data collected from tribal 
communities to fulfill Federal  treaty and trust obligations, Tribal Nations have authority 
to determine the parameters and scope of such data collections , to invoke ultimate 
ownership over the data collected on their citizens , and to require non- Tribal entities to 
comply with Tribal law and Tribal protocols and digital standards for  data collection 
and storage; a
  1https://nni.arizona.edu/programs -projects/policy -analysis -research/indigenous -data-
sovereignty- and-governance ; see also NCAI Resolution ANC -22-010. 


WHEREAS , as self -governing nations, Tribes can determine ownership, access, use, and 
management of certain data derived from their citizens, including but not limited to: demographic 
data, anthropological data, archaeological data, environmental data, public health data, genomic data, medical data, traditional knowledge, proxy data and data obtained using third- party artificial 
intelligence tools; and  
WHEREAS , there i
s a demonstrated propensity of non- Tribal entities, such as private 
corporations, Federal research institutions,  and university research institutions  to extract data from 
Tribal citizens and potentially divide the Tribal interest in protection of its citizens by automating Informed Consent with blockchain and other ledge technologies, without ensuring a clear mutual 
understanding about how that data will be used and disseminated in the future, which can lead to the 
data being exploited for commercially -driven purposes over objectives to advance science; and 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED , tha
t the National Congress of American Indians
(NCAI) calls upon the Department of Health and Human Services , the Department of Defense, and other 
Federal agencies that regularly collect data in Tribal communities to ensure that each age ncy adheres to 
standards that recognize Tribal sovereignty as it relates to  ethical data collection procedures and 
ownership; and  
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , tha t out of respect for Tribal sovereignty, all decisions 
involving the collection, management, and ownership of data taken from Tribal communities must adhere to standards, including those ensuring safety, security, and resiliency needs, set forth by Tribal 
laws and policies; and 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , 
if a Tribe lacks a data governance law, the default research 
practice by non- Tribal entities must require formal and enforceable Tribal consent early in the 
research process and opportunities for Tribal input shall continue throughout the duration of dat a 
collection efforts and the applicable data -life; and  
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that NCAI recognizes that Tribes  also benefit from  drafting 
their own Data Use Agreements and creating their own Tribal Institutional Review Boards to limit or 
amend the scope under which researchers may use data  collected as part of a given project and, 
furthermore, all researchers must be required to enter into a Data Use Agreement prior to c ommencing 
research projects in Tribal communities or on Tribal citizens; a nd
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that NCAI recognizes and supports the role of Tribal 
Epidemiology Centers  in the collection and handling of health data and any other core functions 
estab lished under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act ; and  
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED , that this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI until it is 
withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.

Resolution #ANC-14-015 
TITLE: Calling on Congress to Establish Formal Recognition of Tribal 
Sovereignty and Tribal Consultation in the Communications Act 
WHEREAS,  we, the members of the National Congress of American Indians 
of the United States, invoking the divine blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and 
purposes, in order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the inherent sovereign 
rights of our Indian nations, rights secured under Indian treaties a nd agreements with 
the United States, and all other rights and be nefits to which we are entitled under the 
laws and Constitution of the United States, to enlighten the public toward a better 
understanding of the In dian people, to preserve Indian  cultural values, and otherwise 
promote the health, safety and welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and 
submit the following resolution; and 
WHEREAS, the National Congress of Am erican Indians (NCAI) was 
established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest national organization of American 
Indian and Alaska Native  tribal governments; and 
WHEREAS, on December 3, 2013, the House of Representative’s Energy and 
Commerce Committee announced a multi-year plan for the Committee to “examine 
and update the Communicat ions Act to reflect the Internet era;” and 
WHEREAS, by the Communications Act of 1934, Congress first established 
the universal access goal for communications by charging the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with ensuring that “all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race,  color, religion, national origin, or 
sex” have access to “rapid, efficient, Na tion-wide, and world-wide wire and radio 
communications service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges;” and    
WHEREAS,  the Communications Act of 1934 did not acknowledge tribal 
governments, tribal sovereignty, or the fede ral trust relationship between the FCC and 
tribal governments, and in updating the Communications Act in 1996, Congress again 
did not acknowledge tribes; and 
WHEREAS, the FCC has recognized that access to basic phone service on 
tribal lands lags other areas of America, and the percentage of Americans in rural 
tribal communities without access to fixe d broadband is 8 times higher than the 
national average; and  
WHEREAS, the FCC has expressed deep conc ern for the lack of access to 
telecommunications services on tribal la nds and has sought comment on how to 
promote access to wireline and wireless services, and radio and TV broadcasting services to preserve tribal cultures an d support self-governance, economic opportunity, 
health, education, public sa fety, and welfare; and   


NCAI 2014 Mid Year Resolution ANC-14-015 
Page 2 of 2WHEREAS, in 2010 the FCC formally established the Office of Native Affairs and Policy 
(ONAP) to promote consultation with tribal nations  and native communities as they exercise their 
sovereignty and self-determination, which has resu lted in very positive, tangible benefits; and  
WHEREAS, despite these earnest efforts by the FCC, formal recognition of tribes through 
statutory obligation is the only means to ensuring lasting tribal engagement and consultation to 
address telecommunications issues in Indian Country. 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that NCAI does hereby  urge Congress to 
address past oversights and include in any Communications Ac t update and formal 
acknowledgement of tribal  governments, tribal sovereignty, and the federal trust relationship 
between the FCC and tribal governments; and 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,  that in the event of a Communications Act update, 
Congress must address vital issues to eliminate barriers to tribal  access and participation in the 
Digital Age, such as increasing access to spectrum licenses, preser vation of tribal components of 
the Lifeline and Link Up programs, modernization of the E-rate program to support tribal schools 
and libraries, creation of a Tribal Broadband Fund that provides ta rgeted Universal Service funding 
for broadband deployment and techni cal training as referenced in  the National Broadband Plan, and 
addresses issues regarding Intercar rier Compensation, rate floor, and net neutrality mechanisms that 
have long supported tribal  eligible telecommuni cations carriers; and 
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, that this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI until it is 
withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.

The National Congress of American Indians 
Resolution #ABQ- 19-061 
TITLE: Calling Upon the National Institutes of Health to Consult with Tribal 
Nations and Establish Policies  and Guidance for Tribal Oversight of 
Data on Tribal Citizens Enrolled in the All of Us  Research Program 
WHEREAS,  we, the members of the National Congress of American Indians 
of the United States, invoking the divine blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and 
purposes, in order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the inherent sovereign 
rights of our Indian nations, rights secured under Indian treaties and agreements with 
the United States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are entitled under the 
laws and Constitution of the United States and the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten the public toward a better understanding of 
the Indian people, to preserve Indian cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, 
safety and welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and submit the following 
resolution; and  
WHEREAS, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) was 
established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest national organization of American 
Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments; and 
WHEREAS, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, is the nation’s medical research agency, 
and researchers funded by NIH have made important discoveries that have the 
potential to improve health and reduce health disparities; and 
 
WHEREAS, American  Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have significant 
health disparities that the findings of research could help address, but are often 
overlooked and not represented in research studies; and 
 
WHEREAS,  tribal nations have inherent sovereign rights to govern research 
that occurs with their citizens and on their lands, and are concerned that past negative 
experiences with research may continue to impact their nations; and 
WHEREAS, in some cases, tribal nations have established tribal research 
code s, laws, and research oversight processes to govern research to ensure it benefits 
their nations and reduces risks of harm to their communities; and 
WHEREAS, the NIH established the All of Us  Research Program to recruit 
one million or more people in the United States to improve health through precision 
medicine, which involves the collection of data and biospecimens from individuals to 
understand differences in lifestyle, environment, and biology, including analysis of 
genetic data; and  


NCAI 2019 Annual Resolution ABQ-1 9-061
Page 2  of 3 WHEREAS,  at the request of tribal nations, the NIH initiated a tribal consultation on the 
All of Us  Research Program on May 24, 2019,  requesting input on how to “develop meaningful, 
culturally appropriate collaborations with AI/AN populations” and how to identify “priorities and 
opportunities around the inclusion of AI/AN populations in the research program while also 
implementing the appropriate protections to comply with tribal research oversight and laws;” and 
WHEREAS , the NIH does not have a tribal consultation policy but follows the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services Tribal Consultation Policy, updated in 2010, and  held 
consultation and listening sessions with tribal nations in various locations during the summer of 
2019; and 
WHEREAS,  NIH in its May 24, 2019 letter initiating tribal consultation “welcomed written 
testimony” by August 31, 2019, and then issued a Request for Information (RFI) on September 3, 
2019,  to solicit “additional input to the All of Us Research Program 2019 Tribal Consultation” that 
allows input from the public “for information and planning purposes” which is not a mechanism 
that is used in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service Tribal Consultation Policy and 
does not represent a government- to-government form of consultation; and 
WHEREAS , the NIH Tribal Advisory Committee recently approved a motion to extend the 
tribal consultation by two months to allow for more input and discussion with tribal nations, and 
also requested to review the recommendations of the All of Us  Research Program Tribal 
Collaboration Working Group, which is not a part of the tribal consultation process; and 
WHEREAS,  both NCAI and the United South Eastern Tribes sent letters to the NIH 
Director and the All of Us Research Program in September 2019 requesting an extension to the 
timeline of the tribal consultation and more information and clearer timelines on how the NIH plans 
to respond to the tribal consultation. 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,  that the National Congress of American 
Indians (NCAI) calls on the NIH to continue the All of Us  Research Program tribal consultation to 
allow for more meaningful discussions and input; and 
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,  that NCAI calls on NIH to work closely with the NIH 
Tribal Advisory Committee to assess consultation input to date and immediately develop clear 
processes and guidelines that ask individual sovereign tribal nations to provide prior consent before 
collecting data and specimens from their tribal members, and provide tribal nations oversight of any 
data or biospecimens that are associated with or identified to be from a citizen of their tribal nation; 
and 
BE IT FURTHER  RESOLVED,  that all data collected on AI/AN individuals and data 
identified to be associated with specific tribal nations must be restricted from any research use until 
tribal oversight processes and guidelines are adopted by the NIH All of Us  Research Program; and

The National Congress of American Indians 
Resolution #DEN-18-012 
TITLE: Support for Tribal Nations’ Access to Cyber Security Services and 
Funding 
WHEREAS,  we, the members of the National Congress of American Indians 
of the United States, invoking the divine blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and 
purposes, in order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the inherent sovereign 
rights of our Indian nations, rights secured under Indian treaties and agreements with 
the United States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are entitled under the 
laws and Constitution of the United States and the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten the public toward a better understanding of 
the Indian people, to preserve Indian cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, 
safety and welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and submit the following 
resolution; and  
WHEREAS, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) was 
established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest national organization of American 
Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments; and 
WHEREAS, since 2003, approximately 98  percent of Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) grant funding has gone to state and local governments ; and  
WHEREAS, almost every year over $1 billion dollars has been appropriated 
for DHS grants yet Tribal Nations are only directly eligible for $10 mill ion dollars  of 
non-emergency DHS grants through the Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program; 
and 
WHEREAS, Tribal Nations have been encouraged to see the increase in the 
Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program to $10 million  dollars  but recognize that the 
funds are  not adequate to help all 573 federally recognized tribes  build and sustain 
their home land security capabilities ; and  
 
WHEREAS,  the Department of Homeland Security funded Multi-State 
Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC),  which services for detecting 
and identifying cyber security threats offers free Albert senor services to States but 
requires  Tribal Nations to pay for the sensors; and 
WHEREAS, Tribal Nations maintain the  sensitive data of tribal and non -tribal 
citizens, medic al records, employment records, membership rolls, and critical 
infrastructure information ; and  
WHEREAS, Tribal Nations are constant targets of cyber security attacks and 
threats; and  


NCAI 2018  Annual Resolution DEN-1 8-012 
Page 2  of 2 WHEREAS,  Tribal Nations cyber security preparedness and maturity continues to fall well 
short of state and local governments as measured by the National Cyber Security Review; and 
WHEREAS,  equitable treatment between Tribal Nations’ cyber security needs and state 
cyber security needs would increase the ability of Tribal Nations to protect tribal and non-tribal 
citizen’s data they are tasked with safeguarding. 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,  that the National Congress of American 
Indians (NCAI) calls upon the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Congress to 
fulfill their trust responsibility to Tribal Nations by substantially increasing funding for the Tribal 
Homeland Security Grant Program and direct MS-ISAC to provide free Albert sensors to each 
Tribal Nation as they do to states; and 
BE IT FURTHER  RESOLVED , that this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI until it is 
withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.
