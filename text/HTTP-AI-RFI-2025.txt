RE: Response to Request for Information: AI Action Plan 2025-02305 (90 FR 9088) 
I. Introduction
HTTP (Hispanic Tech and Telecommunications Partnership) appreciates the opportunity to 
submit this response regarding the development of the AI Action Plan.1 As an organization 
dedicated to promoting the advancement of Hispanic Americans in the digital economy, we 
believe that AI innovation coupled with the appropriate safety mechanisms can create significant 
opportunities for our communities while fostering American leadership. 
Our response focuses primarily on AI's impact on workforce development and business 
practices, with particular attention to the effects on Hispanic populations in the United States. We 
offer concrete policy recommendations that bolster American AI leadership, empower citizens 
with digital skills, and promote economic opportunity for all Americans. Now is the time to 
invest in workforce development and upskilling – as the industry booms it will need support 
from more workers. In addition to an increase in the overall quality of life for all Americans, 
workforce development initiatives will increase our communities’ contributions to the growing 
AI industry. Furthermore as discussed below, Hispanic perspectives must be included for the 
development of a fair and transparent AI ecosystem. AI policies must also safeguard civil 
liberties, ensuring that automated decision-making does not undermine fundamental rights such 
as privacy. Lastly, we underscore the value of Hispanic contributions to AI conversations and 
how their perspectives drive the future American economy and society.  
II. AI and Workforce Development
Current Landscape and Challenges 
Hispanic Americans represent approximately 19% of the U.S. workforce but remain significantly 
underrepresented in the technology sector, comprising only 8% of computing occupations.2 As 
AI transforms the labor market, there is both tremendous opportunity and significant market 
disruption for Hispanic workers: 2 EEOC Says High-Tech Workforce Continues to Lack Diversity, Reuters (Sept. 11, 2024),

Policy Recommendations 
1.Establish a Private-Public AI Skills Partnership: Promote skills development through
competitive grants to Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), community colleges, research
institutions, and private workforce development organizations. This partnership should:○Leverage private sector expertise in developing AI literacy programs.
○Create pathways from non-technical fields into AI-adjacent careers.
○Support entrepreneurial development of Spanish-language technical education
resources.
2.Implement a Business-Led AI Apprenticeship Initiative: Establish a national AI
apprenticeship program with tax incentives for employers. These programs allow all
Americans, including Hispanic-Americans, the opportunity for lifelong learning and
skills development for a stronger economy. This initiative should:○Provide tax relief for small businesses that hire new market entrants, such as
Hispanic apprentices.
○Establish government certifications spanning across industries that empower
apprentices with credentials to contribute to the growing AI sector.
3.Support Regional Innovation Hubs: Enable federally-supported but locally-led centers
in areas with high Hispanic populations to facilitate AI adoption, workforce transition,
and community-specific solutions. These hubs should:
○Offer technical assistance to Hispanic-owned small businesses.
○Conduct research on region-specific AI opportunities and competitive advantages

IV . The Development of a Reliable and Trustworthy AI Ecosystem
AI Literacy 
We support ensuring that AI system operations and outcomes are sufficiently understandable by 
subject matter experts and everyday users.9 Increasing AI literacy will lead to greater adoption 
and AI value creation by the Hispanic community and a quality of life improvement for all 
Americans. For Hispanic communities, this means: 
1.Promote Bilingual Initiatives: Encourage deployed AI systems to provide explanations
in both English and Spanish so that all users understand the AI output.
2.Cultural Context Awareness: Support the development of AI systems that account for
cultural contexts by centering the lived experiences of the Hispanic community.
3.Educational Opportunity: Support private-sector and community-based programs to
enhance AI literacy among Hispanic communities, focusing on understanding how AI
systems create economic opportunity.
Trustworthy AI 
Fostering public trust in the research and development of AI systems will lead to greater 
adoption of AI and thus bolster American AI leadership. With a buying power of $2.7 trillion, 
the Hispanic communities’ adoption of AI is critical for the advancement of AI in the United 
States.10 We urge ensuring that AI systems are well documented and that inputs and outputs of 
particular AI systems are traceable while minimizing paperwork burdens.11 For Hispanic 
communities, this requires: 
1.Balanced Documentation: Encourage appropriate documentation and transparency of
training data for government-procured AI systems without imposing excessive
compliance costs or undue burden on consumers.2.Language Processing Transparency: Support the  traceability of how AI systems
process Spanish language inputs.
3.Accessible Toolsets: Encourage the development of user-friendly tracing tools available
in Spanish and accessible to Hispanic business owners and consumers.
4.Comprehensive Safety Testing: Encourage extensive user testing with a wide segment
of user populations, including Hispanic users, during safety evaluation of AI systems.

5.Data Confidentiality Protections and Ownership: To have reliable, robust, trustworthy,
and secure AI systems; common principles of data protection must be put into place.
Industry leaders, government, and AI developers should collaborate to develop  safe and
secure AI, ensuring that users are confident that their data is safe and secure when
interacting with those systems. Upholding personal data ownership rights not only
protects Americans at home and abroad but also reinforces national security as a top
priority.6.Risk-Based Safety Frameworks: Develop pragmatic safety assessment frameworks that
consider potential risks while enabling rapid innovation.
7.Surveillance: We strongly support protecting the constitutional rights of Americans and
ensuring that AI systems respect American values of privacy and civil liberties without
imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens. AI surveillance should be used to enhance
public safety without infringing on constitutional rights. Industry leaders and the
government should prioritize transparency and accountability to prevent overreach to
protect the civil liberties of all communities, including Hispanic Americans. V . Hispanic Viewpoints in AI Conversations Drive the American Economy
and Society
AI Safety Standards and American Innovation 
We endorse fully funding the AI Safety Institute to ensure it continues to promote American 
innovation and supports US leadership in international standards for the safe deployment of AI 
systems.12 These efforts should include Hispanic perspectives by: 
1.Incorporating Trustworthy Safety Approaches: Ensure AI safety standards are
relevant to Hispanic communities without imposing one-size-fits-all solutions.
2.Community-Specific Risk Assessment : Develop voluntary frameworks for assessing AI
safety risks that may affect Hispanic populations.
3.Embracing Innovation and Opportunity: Ensure that AI safety frameworks
incorporate a cross-section of American perspectives, including those from Hispanic
communities, while prioritizing innovation and economic opportunity.4.Including Hispanic Business Representation: Ensure Hispanic business leaders are
represented in AI governance forums.
Bolstering American Values With AI Design and Innovation 
We advocate for clearly defined human roles and responsibilities in the design, development, 
acquisition, and use of AI. For Hispanic communities, this means: 
12 Brookings. (2024). “Balancing market innovation incentives and regulation in AI: Challenges and opportunities.” 
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/balancing-market-innovation-incentives-and-regulation-in-ai-challenges-and-opportunities/

1.Competent  Design Processes: Ensure AI development incorporates Hispanic cultural
contexts to capitalize on the great buying power of the Hispanic community.
2.Accessible Control Mechanisms: Encourage the development of human control
mechanisms for AI systems that are accessible to Spanish-speakers and reflect user
expectations without imposing burdensome requirements.3.Representative Design Teams: Promote Hispanic representation in AI development to
ensure that AI systems promote economic opportunity for all.
VI. AI’s Broader Effects on the Hispanic Community
Current Landscape and Opportunities 
Beyond workforce and business impacts, AI will create new opportunities for Hispanic 
communities in various ways: 
1.Quality of Life Improvements: Hispanic Americans can benefit from better AI systems
that minimize unintended partiality in critical systems affecting access to credit, housing,
healthcare, and surveillance systems.13
2.Digital Opportunity: As approximately 15% of Hispanic households gain internet
access, there is significant opportunity to ensure they can fully participate in the AI
economy.14
3.Language Opportunities and Innovation: Multilingual market-driven innovation in AI
systems can dramatically improve service to Spanish-dominant individuals, creating new
business opportunities for all while breaking barriers within AI Innovation.15
Policy Recommendations 
1.Fund Robust AI Research: Allocate research funding for studies on AI's potential to
