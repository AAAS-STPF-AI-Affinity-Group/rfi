General Comment
Any use of AI should be very careful to not infringe upon the rights of the creators. The com m on LLMs do not satisfy requirem ents that
content created by them  or other gen AI is not inherently plagiaristic. 
The prom ises m ade by AI com panies are often overblown and done for investor m oney.
