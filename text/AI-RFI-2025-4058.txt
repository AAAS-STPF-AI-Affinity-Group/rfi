General Comment
As a owner of a com pany in arts and entertainm ent, AI com panies, such as OpenAI should be given no legal exem ption to existing
copyright laws. 
They should not be granted the ability to steal data from  m illions of people across the world. They should only be allowed to use data that
they have purchased the rights to train their m odels on. 
Creation of such an exem ption erodes the strength of existing copyright laws intended to protect works created by individuals, sm all
business owners, and larger organizations.
