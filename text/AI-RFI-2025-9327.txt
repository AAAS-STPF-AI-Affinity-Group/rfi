General Comment
I believe that the ways in which generative AI has been used publicly and privately have negatively im pacted the public's trust in what is
real and especially im pacts the work and ability to live off of art. Art is a necessary function in society, and genAI seeks to strip the rights
away from  the creators that so m any people look to. I am  fully opposed to granting protections from  copyright laws to these com panies.
