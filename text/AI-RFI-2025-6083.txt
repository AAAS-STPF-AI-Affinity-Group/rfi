General Comment
As a creative person and resident of the US, I believe AI item s becom ing copywritable is a danger to all creative fields. AI can essentially
only be trained using works created by people, m eaning it can only be used to exploit existing work. Given that there are no real
protections financially for artists, there are no ways to prevent this from  creating financial ruin for artistic people.
