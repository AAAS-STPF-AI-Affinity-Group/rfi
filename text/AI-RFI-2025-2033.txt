General Comment
Going forward with this AI nonsense is going to open the floodgates of lawsuits, tear apart ethics, but above all else its sucking the soul
out of hum anity as a whole. Why on earth do we need to continuously ham m er this into Big Techs heads that not only do we not WANT
AI for its lackluster tech and abilities, but to slap people in the face by unlocking the ability to have them  train on works m ade by hum ans?
They want all the benefits of hum anity with none of the work, the dedication, the soul- they're soulsucking leeches and nothing else. 
You're not opening a can of worm s, you're opening som ething far worse, for no reward.
