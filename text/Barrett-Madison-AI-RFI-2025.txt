This is abhorrent; if an AI model can not be created without violating established copyright
laws or infringing on the unique creations of independent content creators than it does notdeserve to be created. This is akin to theft being not only excused but sanctioned because themeans of that theft might prove useful to future thieves to improve their skills at thievery. Thisis also a massive waste of resources - allowing a failure of a technical product and itsburdensome development process to be foisted on the government. Allowing this to continueis unethical and inefficient, values I hoped the current administration would have more interestin holding.The reported and hypothetical potential of AI has blinded individuals to the obvious scams thedevelopers of such products are currently exposing our government to. This is garbage andneeds to be discarded readily before the rights of millions of Americans are sacrificed for theprofit of charlatans and con men in the AI industry, notably OPEN AI.
