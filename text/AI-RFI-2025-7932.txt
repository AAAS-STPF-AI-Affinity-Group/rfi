General Comment
AI is garbage and should not be allowed in any way, shape or form  to steal from  copyrighted and other protected works. Allowing AI to
do this is tantam ount to theft - it is unethical and unwanted. AI serves zero purpose, and all it does is pirate from  actual creative hum ans to
enrich the least creative people on the planet.
