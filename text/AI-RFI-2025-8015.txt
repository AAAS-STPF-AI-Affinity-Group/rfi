General Comment
I believe that allowing AI com panies to harvest the intellectual property of Am erican artists and scientists goes against the core Am erican
dream  of people being able to m ake it in Am erica by plying their own trade and starting their own business. Writers, m usicians, visual
artists, actors and m ore all put m assive am ounts of work into creating their art, and they deserve protections from  corporations stealing
their hard work. Artists should be able to m ake a living by creating new and beautiful works of art without having to worry about
som ebody who has never picked up a brush, an instrum ent or m icrophone stealing their work. 
Additionally, AI consum es a huge am ount of power and water, two resources that will be in increasingly short supply as the population
grows and as the changing clim ate increases the frequency of natural disasters dam aging critical infrastructure. 
The increasing prevalence of AI deepfakes poses serious risks to our political system , m assively increasing the effectiveness of fake news,
as well as m aking it easier to create. This risk is both foreign and dom estic, it strikes at the core us ideal of free and fair elections.
