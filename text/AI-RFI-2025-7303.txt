General Comment
AI has no business being supported by US law unless US law would like to openly condone theft. So m any artists have already had their
livelihoods dam aged by these hucksters pretending AI is anything other than a m achine that is m ade to plagerize anything it is fed.
This is not even accounting for the dam age it is doing to the environm ent in an already dangerous tim e in clim ate change.
Even if you don't care about that, if you have children or grandchildren, this is som ething that will effect them  if it isn't already. Please do
not support AI rights. It's ridiculous that the argum ent has gotten this far already and a truly dark tim e for US legislation if you let this pass.
