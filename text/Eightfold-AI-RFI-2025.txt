Subject: Response to Request for Information on the Development of an Arti ﬁcial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
“This document is approved for public dissemination. The document contains no

Dear White House AI Policy Leaders, 
Eightfold AI appreciates the opportunity to provide input on the AI Action Plan as directed 
by Executive Order 14179, "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence." As a leader in AI-driv en talent  solutions, we strongly advocate for integrating 
workforce intelligence into the national AI strategy. America's ability to maintain AI 
dominance depends not only on technological advancements but also on a skilled 
workforce prepared for the future. 
In the short tenure of the new administration, they have made their objectives clear: 
1.Skills-Based Hiring and Talent Management
On March 4, President Trump addressed Congress, stating “We believe that you should be 
hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. You should be 
hired based on merit.” This is further highlighted by Executive Order 14170: Reforming the 
Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service and Executive Order 
14173: Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.  
2.American Supremacy in AI
On February 11, Vice President JD Vance delivered remarks at the AI Action Summit in 
Paris, France stating 4 objectives:  
●To ensure that American AI technology is the  gold standard globally;
●To avoid excessive AI regulations;
●To remove ideological bias from AI
●To chart a pro-worker growth path for AI
We believe Eightfold AI is the enabler that will help America achieve these objectives. For 
the past decade, Eightfold has leveraged AI to enable some of the largest enterprise and

● The annual review has been completed and is currently undergoing evaluation by 
the FedRAMP Program Management O ﬃce (PMO). 
● Eightfold is seeking support from the Air Force and Army for related certi ﬁcations. 
 
Impact Level 4 (IL4): 
● Eightfold has achieved a DOD-compliant environment aligned with IL4 through 
sponsorship from the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). 
● Obtaining an IL4 Authorization to Operate (ATO) from DIU and the Defense 
Information Systems Agency (DISA), which includes necessary documentation 
and assessments.   
Current Challenges in the US Federal Workforce 
 The U.S. federal government employs millions, yet lacks a uni ﬁed, real-time view of its  
workforce’s skills. This gap hinders strategic planning, limits adaptability, leads to 
governmental ineﬃciency, and risks ceding competitive gr ound to nations and industries 
that leverage AI-driven talent insights. Eightfold AI proposes a transformative solution: 
deploy our proprietary, deep-learning AI - purpose-built for talent intelligence - to create a 
dynamic, comprehensive skills inventory of the entire federal workforce.   
Federal agencies operate in silos, with no centralized, up-to-date understanding of 
employee skills - both explicit (e.g. listed certiﬁcations) and inferred (e.g.  capabilities  
derived from experience). As global industries evolve rapidly, driven by technology and 
shifting demands, the government must know what skills it has, what it needs, and how 
those skills trend across regions, functions, job families, and agencies. Without this, 
workforce planning remains reactive, not proactive.   
According to Executive Order 14170, within 120 days, the Federal Government shall 
develop a Federal Hiring Plan that promotes merit-based hiring, regardless of race, sex, or 
religion, decrease government-wide time to hire to under 80 days, provide a better 
applicant experience, and integrate modern solutions to meet these needs. 
 
Our Solution 
 Eightfold’s solution addresses exactly the needs spelled out in Executive Order 14170. By 
leveraging AI, Eightfold’s solution is the only solution in the market that delivers 
merit-based talent outcomes. In fact, our AI-driven Match Scores have been validated to 
be positively correlated with performance and tenure. Additionally, Eightfold offers 
candidate masking of race, gender, or religion, ensuring talent is hired and promoted by 
merit alone. Eightfold’s solutions have decreased time-to-hire across our best-in-class 
customers by 20% and increased hiring eﬃciency by 92%. Our candidate  experience is 
unparalleled, as demonstrated by visitor-to-applicant conversion rates 4x industry 
averages for our Personalized Career Site product, with all outcomes achieved only by 
leveraging Responsible AI.

Eightfold’s AI platform can leverage OPM’s USA Sta ﬃng to deliver a single, dynamic skills  
inventory that updates in real-time. By analyzing both structured data (e.g. resumes, job 
titles) and unstructured data (e.g. project reports, training histories), our AI uncovers not 
just stated skills but also inferred competencies. This enables agencies to:  
 
● Monitor supply and demand: track existing skills against emerging needs, by 
agency and region  
● Anticipate trends: compare federal skill trajectories to global industry benchmarks 
for full situational awareness while enhancing mission readiness  
● Optimize resources: identify gaps, redeploy talent internally, and prioritize upskilling 
- all without costly external hiring  
● Illustrate not only where employees are deployed but where they are needed most  
 
For example, an agency could instantly see how many employees in the Midwest have 
cybersecurity-adjacent skills, infer untapped potential from related experience, and adjust 
training pipelines as threats evolve - all in weeks, not years.  
 
Case Study: GigEagle at the Department of Defense  
 
The Department of Defense (DoD) offers a practical example of this approach through its 
GigEagle initiative (GigEagle.mil), powered by Eightfold’s AI technology. GigEagle captures the commercial skills that Reservists and National Guard members develop in their 
civilian jobs - such as data science or logistics optimization - and maps them to speciﬁc 
DoD projects. Instead  of recalling these part-time personnel for routine tasks like painting 
fences (a holdover from active-duty assignments), GigEagle deploys them to high-impact 
roles, like building real-time deployment dashboards or solving AI-driven challenges. This 
shift maximizes talent utility and mission outcomes. While the White House RFI’s scope 
extends beyond DoD-speciﬁc needs to the broader  Government workforce, GigEagle 
demonstrates how AI can unlock hidden skills, align them with pressing demands, and 
keep pace with change - principles directly applicable government-wide.  
 
Why Eightfold AI? 
 Unlike generic skills-matching tools, our proprietary deep-learning engine was designed 
speciﬁcally for talent intelligence.  It excels at processing complex, messy data - common 
in government systems - while continuously learning to re ﬁne its insights. This isn’t a 
static snapshot;  it’s a living system that adapts as needs shift. Our proven success with 
large enterprises and the DoD (via GigEagle) underscores our scalability and precision, 
positioning us to serve the federal workforce comprehensively.  
 
Impact on National Competitiveness:  
 
A skills-smart government can pivot faster, innovate smarter, and lead globally. By 
equipping agencies with real-time talent visibility, Eightfold AI empowers the U.S. to stay

The Critical Role of AI in Workforce and Economic Competitiveness 
 ● Developing Skills for Global Competitiveness 
 
○ The ability to effectively mobilize and upskill workforces has been a key factor 
in determining global leadership. In today's landscape, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) 
has become the new fr ontier  in the great power competition. For America, the 
capacity to integrate AI into workforce development will be pivotal in 
maintaining its leadership on the world stage. The eﬃciency and innovation 
with which the U.S. can harness AI to upskill  its workforce will directly impact 
its geopolitical and economic standing, shaping the nation's future role in this 
high-stakes global race.  
 
○ It's crucial to have a skilled workforce ready for today and tomorrow. Eightfold 
AI’s Talent Intelligence Platform (TIP) has helped Federal agencies by creating 
a skills-based inventory of the entire workforce, mapping current and future 
skills to open roles. It ensures alignment between employee skills and job 
requirements and between workforce strategies and agency goals while 
staying ahead of industry trends and disruptions to ensure readiness for 
evolving demands in AI.  
○ By focusing on future-proof skills and an AI-ready workforce, the platform 
helps maintain the competitiveness of American workers amidst 
advancements in technology.  
○ Eightfold AI’s platform utilizes a combination of enterprise talent data and 
public market data to predict labor market trends accurately. It highlights 
potential skill gaps and provides actionable insights to address these 
deﬁciencies through proactiv e reskilling efforts. This approach not only 
ensures the workforce can meet the demands of national security but also 
supports broader economic goals by maintaining a highly skilled and adaptable 
labor force.

●Merit-Based Hiring for National Growth
○Merit-based hiring involves selecting candidates based on their skills,
quali ﬁcations, and potential rather than relying  on traditional proxies such as
degrees or educational pedigree. President Trump espoused this approach as
a key principle in workforce strategies to ensure that hiring decisions are fair
and unbiased. By focusing on merit, the strategy aims to attract and retain the
most capable individuals, thus fostering an eﬃcient and competent workforce .
○Eightfold AI's Talent Intelligence Platform uses advanced AI algorithms to
match candidates to job roles based on an extensive analysis of their skills ,
experience , and potential. The platform has demonstrated a strong positive
correlation between the match scores it generates and actual employee
performance. This indicates that the technology can objectively and accurately
assess a candidate's suitability for a role, moving beyond traditional
educational credentials. As a result, this technology helps in making
merit-based hiring decisions that are unbiased and inclusive.

Please refer to the blog below for details on Skills Based 
Hiring: https://eightfold.ai/blog/importance-hiring-for-skills/.
○Eightfold AI's platform is designed to evaluate candidates primarily on their skill
sets and competencies. By doing so, it mitigates the biases that may arise
from over-reliance on educational backgrounds or previous job titles. This
approach widens the scope of opportunity for individuals from diverse
backgrounds and supports the creation of a more inclusive workforce.
Eightfold's Match Score uses skills-based metrics to evaluate candidate-job ﬁt,
employing machine learning techniques to pr edict  matches based on job
requirements. The platform has been validated to correlate with Match Score
and Retention. As the only ones in the industry to show a correlation between
Match Score and performance , we can be conﬁdent our AI match scores
enable merit-based opportunities.
●Ensuring Compliance with Federal Anti-Discrimination Law:
○Resulting from the executive orders, the Federal Government is seeking to
ensure that employers comply with anti-discrimination law. Eightfold’s AI
platform, by focusing on skills and merit-based qualiﬁcations, facilitates
companies and the US government to ensur e compliance with federal
anti-discrimination. In fact, as mentioned above, the platform, under UGSP ,
helps ensure any decisions made in hiring come down to qualiﬁcations and
skills - and nothing else.
