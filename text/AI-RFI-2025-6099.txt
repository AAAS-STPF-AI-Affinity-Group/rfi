General Comment
I believe the scraping of copyrighted m aterial for the use of generative ai training is antithetical to the entire point of the copyright system . It
aim s to protect authors and artists, but allowing generative AI, which by its very nature can only ever be derivative and copy, to train off
of copyrighted m aterial would m ean an end to those protections. 
In addition, it is outright theft on a m assive scale. corporations and independent artists would be responsible for the bulk of the work in
training, but receive no credit, no kickback, and in fact would only be hurt by this. 
There are argum ents to be m ade on the efficacy and use of generative AI, but as the m ethods of generation currently stand, there is no
way to allow training on copyrighted m aterial without fully dism antling the copyright system  in its entirety.
