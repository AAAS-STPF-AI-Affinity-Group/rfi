General Comment
The US governm ent does not and should never have the right to freely steal from  its people for any purpose. This is the death of the
concept of ownership for nothing. “AI” is not intelligent and it can never becom e intelligent because it can only ever tell you what it thinks
you want to hear. Open AI is a cancer on the entire world and m ust not be given these abhorrent perm issions under any circum stances,
and anyone suggesting they should is a crook and a grifter
