General Comment
I think AI is a cultural dead end for Am erica and the death of innovation.
com panies being able to strip m ine the creativity of the Am erican people and then sell it back to Am ericans all while destroying the
livelihood of the people it stole from  is detestable. The people pushing to give these com panies free reign are m otivated by nothing others
that short sighted greed.
