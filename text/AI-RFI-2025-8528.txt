General Comment
Generative AI is plagiarism  tech. Itâ€™s anti-hum an, and exactly the wrong type of thing we should be autom ating through program s. AI
should do dishes and spot cancer cells, and people should m ake art and stories. Not only is generative AI plagiarism , it is also inefficient
and horrible for the environm ent. Furtherm ore, people who create art and writing and stories have intellectual property rights which should
not be violated by skim m ing and AI training. STOP MAKING EVERYTHING AI; A LOT OF US HATE IT.
