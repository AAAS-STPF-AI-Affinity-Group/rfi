General Comment
This is a terrible idea in every way im aginable. This will not help anyone. This will not protect anyone. This will com pletely destroy the
livelihoods of every Am erican who uses the internet. The only groups who would benefit are thieves and con artists who just want to steal
other people's work. An Am erica that em braces AI is not an Am erica with any kind of future.
