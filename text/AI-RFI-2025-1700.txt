General Comment
GenAi com panies know where all the court cases are headed, and how badly itâ€™s going to go for them .
Their only resort? Entirely destroy legal system s that are in our constitution in order to get away with their theft of copyrighted works.
No joke IF they get this, the US will likely face irreparable harm  as pivotal industries that rely on copyright protections crash.
