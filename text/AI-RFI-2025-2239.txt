General Comment
AI has no place in the future of Am erica. It creates weakness in a already weak society. Am erica was great when hard work m eant
som ething. Relying on com puters to replace hardworking Am ericans will only further the decline of an increasingly lazy people. Only to be
exported outside of our country for foreign nations to profit. AI should not be allowed to access the work of copyright m aterial.
