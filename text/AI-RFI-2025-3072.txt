General Comment
This current order would not only destroy any form  of copyright protection of US m edia under those laws but would also allow foreign
bodies easier access to said m edia due to the m ore lenient push for AI training m aking the whole push for this law useless. All this would
do is give these m ajor tech corporations that m ajority of the Am erican people do not like m ore unneeded power. To put it short, with the
growth of com panies like OpenAI, all I'm  seeing is a 90s Microsoft 2.0 and a law like this would for sure cause significant dam age on
m any industries and all the content with interact with daily.
