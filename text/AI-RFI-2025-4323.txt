General Comment
Way to drop this on a Saturday. People who know it's universally. Nobody wants AI garbage to replace hum an-m ade things. This is
absopute overreach. If you want art m ade, if you want anything, you should pay to get people with the skills they developed to do it.
When your plum bing breaks, starts shooting water all over your floor, who do you call? Som eone with the skills. When your boiler
breaks, when your AC acts up, ehej your car breaks down? Som ebody who knows what they're doing and the reasons behind it.
This sam e concept applies with m usic. It applies with art. It applies with m ixing audio, m aking m ovies.
AI does not have an understanding or any m otives behind any scene. It has no soul and it's not worth the energy it takes for creative
outlets like it. People build up these skills and learn for a reason. They'll m ake som ething red to signify som ething, whereas AI would not
know. It has no thought.
Letting artificial intelligence do any of these things underm ines artistic integrity. It underm ines creativity. But m ost im portant of all, it
underm ines what being a hum an is all about.
I'm  writing this to say enough is enough. Anyone with integrity knows AI is not the right way to go and it should be treated as an aid to
creation, but not as the sculptor. Or artist.
