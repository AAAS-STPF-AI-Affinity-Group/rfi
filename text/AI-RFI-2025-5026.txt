General Comment
No, Open AI should not be able to freely access copyrighted work, due to defying the very point of a copyright. Copyrights serve as a
safeguard to ensure their m aterial is protected from  other businesses, and forces m edia to expand in new directions. If Open AI wants to
use training data, they MUST use open source data or m ake their own data to rely off of. Open AI cannot have or gain the right to access
and/or violate copyrighted data.
