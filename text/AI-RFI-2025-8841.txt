General Comment
Under no circum stances should AI be utilized in this capacity. It is at best an experim ent which in no way can replace workers. Of
particular note is copyright infringem ent as well as gross inaccuracies presented as fact. Once again billionaires are attem pting to burrow
their way, tick-like, further into governm ent. Unacceptable.
