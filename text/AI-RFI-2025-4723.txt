General Comment
AI should not be exem pt from  the sam e rules all of us have to follow. If they are allowed to be above the law, hum ankind suffers. In the
m idst of an oncom ing recession, even m ore people will be out of jobs because their em ployers will replace them  with AI. Millions will be
cheated out of fair pay for their work, what kind of free m arket prevents the m oney from  flowing? Don't let AI com panies steal from  the
people just so they can attem pt to keep a failing business venture afloat. No one likes generative AI, it's just inventing ways to do tasks
wrong that worked fine before without it.
