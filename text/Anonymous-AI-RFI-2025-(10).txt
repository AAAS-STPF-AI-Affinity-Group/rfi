AI, as it exists today, is not used in an ethical way, and functions on the stolen work of millions 
of artists and writers. The data centers required to operate these AI algorithms also drain 
immense amounts of both energy and water, which are precious resources meant for use by people. I do not recommend investing heavily in something that is destroying the livelihoods of artists and writers and using our resources.
