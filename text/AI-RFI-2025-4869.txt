General Comment
I do NOT believe that generative AI has a place in the future of Am erica. This directly and negatively im pacts the lives of the individuals
their databases train off of, allowing generative AI to continue on in our country would be at a disservice for what the "Am erican Dream "
stands for. Do not allow this technology to steal and steal from  the citizens of this country.
