Dear Mr . D’Souza:  
Liquidax  appreciates the opportunity to submit  the following comments in response  to the request  
for information  (RFI) published by the Ne tworking and Information Technology Research and 
Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office (NCO), National Science Foundation on behalf 
of the Office  of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in the Federal Register on February 6, 2025, 
requesting input from interested parties on priority actions that should be included in the Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Action Plan.  
Introduction to Liquidax  


Founde d in 2014, Liquidax is a leading intellectual property (IP) advisor, investor and management 
firm supporting all types of intellectual property rights including copyrights, patents, trademarks, 
trade secrets and others.  Our partners and clients consist of large, medium and small cap 
corporations globally, as well as, startups, venture investors, courts and other stakeholders seeking 
to protect and build systems designed to maximize the value of their IP assets, protect their 
investments and enable new industries with fairness. 
Led by a team of business executives, technologists, researchers and legal experts with decades of 
experience; Liquidax has worked across  numerous industry sectors including technology, media, 
energy, financial  services , publishing, healthcare, manufacturing and software.  
Building AI Tools that Empower Creators  
We are currently working with leading content creators to build the capability for copyright owners 
to reclaim the approval and management process of their copyrighted works that are being ingested 
to train large language models to ultimately be monetized by a small number of dominant AI 
companies.  The growth and innovative advancements being driven by U.S. AI companies has been 
staggering and has obviously become a major driver for the U.S. economy. In just over a decade, the 
generative AI market has surp assed $25 billion in the U.S. and the data center GPU market has 
surpassed $125 billion.1  The potential for additional growth and creative output presented by AI is 
tremendous and we agree with the objective of the Trump Administration to “enhance America’s AI 
dominance.”  But amid  all this growth  and market excitement something fundamental has been lost. 
The value of these generative AI platforms is not built entirely on their computing power, elegant 
user interfaces or sophisticated modeling technologies.  At the most basic level, they are built on the 
data that is ingested and used to train them.  They have accessed and harnessed this  data without 
permission and almost exclusively without compensation to the American authors, artists, journalists, 
musicians and other creators  to whom it belongs.  A national AI Action Plan which does not address 
1 https://iot -analytics.com/leading -generative- ai-companies/  


this glaring concern (which is the subject of 16 current lawsuits2) is incomplete and will result in 
less innovation and competition for the numerous disruptors like Liquidax attempting to develop 
market -based solutions to empower U.S. creators and copyright owners.  
For instance,  in the  music industry alone, there are a number of AI technology companies which 
strive to do things as diverse as identifying songs for sync licenses, determining musical provenance 
and driving fan engagement.  To date, however, there are few, if any, comprehensive efforts  dedicated 
purely to building an efficient and effective rights -owner platform  with processes and methods to 
gain consent for the ingestion of composition and/or master copyright ed content, provide creators 
control of their assets and establish a compensation mechanism for derivative works created by AI. The development of this platform is achievable despite claims to the contrary by large AI companies . 
It is possible  and the technology is in the initial d evelopment phases now. 
The Liquidax team is collaborating with existing media and technology companies along with AI 
experts to continue to build out our intellectual property assets and portfolio required to build an 
effective platform focused on the needs of the music industry.  We are working closely with industry 
leaders , legal experts, artists and others  to construct the framework that respects creators , protects 
their IP and compensates them for their work.  Simultaneously, Liquidax and our partners are ensuring the growth of AI  empowers them and ensures new market and revenue opportunities. 
We realize the success of efforts from entities like Liquidax will require a change in perspective and 
legal
 posture from many companies in the AI industry.  It is clear to us that the entirety of the  AI and 
technology sector is committed to a business model built on the belief that the unfettered ingestion of the corpus of the world’s creative works is simply “fair use” and they can freely build multi -
billion businesses on top of these works that they do not own and did not ask permission for.   
However, American AI companies and researchers are best positioned to license American -made IP
 
– the highest quality and most dominant source of IP in the world. In other words, licensing content
is not only a matter of fairness or protection of the American econo my: It is exactly h ow America
can ensure AI developed h ere can ensure superiority . In short: High quality training data leads to
high quality AI outputs ; better AI models result in long -term market strength  and adoption.

and -class -actions/  


The AI Action Plan could super- charge American AI development  by reiterating the importance of 
strong copyright protection, the need for AI data training transparency and support for the 
development of market-based content licensing mechanisms.   
Respect for Creators Can be Balanced with AI Innovation  
In seeking public comment on the highest priority policy actions that should be in the new AI Action 
Plan, the Office of Science and Technology policy rightly recognizes that intellectual property is a 
significant and relevant topic.   
The U.S. has long led the world in the development of IP and it drives an overwhelming majority of 
our economic activity and GDP.   The vast trove of creative content that is protected by U.S. 
copyright law  is also the most fundamental building block of any generative AI platform.  The fastest 
chipset, the most sophisticated AI models or the most elegant user interface is meaningless unless they are built and trained on the best datasets.  To date, this has occurred largely by dominant AI companies simply ingesting all the data they can access without permission and, almost exclusively, 
without compensation to the creators and copyright owners of that data.   
When the Administration speaks about the relevance of IP in the formation of the AI Action Plan, 
this must be the primary issue it confronts.  
The United States has long been a leader in technological innovation, and AI will be  no exception. 
To maintain this leadership and foster economic growth, it is essential that U.S. law supports the 
responsible development and deployment of AI. However, this must be balanced with a commitment 
to transparency regarding the use of copyrighted material in training large language models (LLMs) 
and a market -based framework that ensures fair compensation for creators.  
These objectives are not mutually exclusive.  The Trump Administration’s AI Action Plan will 
unleash a wave of additional innovation that will lead to market -based data training 
transparency and content licensing solutions IF it adheres to several core policy and legal tenets : 
 
 


1. P romoting AI Innovation While Ensuring Transparency
AI has the potential to drive significant economic and societal benefits, from improving
productivity to enhancing access to knowledge. However, for AI to grow sustainably, there
must be transparency regarding the data used in training these models —particu larly when
that data includes copyrighted material. The U.S. should establish clear statutory
requirements for the disclosure of training data sources .  This will help ensure that AI
development respects intellectual property rights while fostering trust i n AI systems.
2.Support a Market -Based Licensing Framework
A market -based approach to licensing copyrighted content for AI training is essential to
protecting the rights of creators while allowing AI development to proceed responsibly.Creators —whether authors, musicians, artists, or other rights holders —deserve t o be
compensated when their works are used to train AI. Establishing clear creation and licensingframeworks  for copyrights of recordings and/or text along with copyright derivatives  will
encourage investment in creative industries while providing AI developers with a lawful andstructured way to access necessary training data.
3. U.S. Cop yright Law Already Protects Creators
Existing U.S. copyright law provides a robust framework to protect creators fromunauthorized use of their works. U.S. law should not support AI platforms’ claim of "fair
use" as a blanket justification for training models on copyrighted materials withoutpermission  or compensation. Fair use was never intended to permit mass ingestion of
copyrighted works for commercial AI training, particularly when such use could dramaticallyimpact important industries by others using AI as a substitute tool to create co ntent
undermining the market s for original creative content.
The Market Will Develop Effective Solutions f or Creators and AI Developers  
Beyond setting out a clear policy and legal framework that prioritizes transparency and market -based 
creation, protection, management and licensing solutions for the millions of American content 
creators, the Administration’s AI Action Plan should empower smaller technology companies to 
also enter the market and develop new tools and solutions. 


By pr omoting a market-based approach to licensing copyrighted content for AI training, the Trump 
Administration will further incentivize numerous new entrants and attract significant new 
investment.  In addition to the work being done by companies like Liquidax, there are dozens of 
other disruptive companies working on solutions ranging from licensing datasets to monitoring AI 
output for infringement and building effective watermarking solutions.   This innovation will lead to better more efficient solution s for America’s IP owners  which will only build the confidence and 
value of generative AI platforms  when they work together with companies like Liquidax and its 
partners.  
Conclusion  
The U.S. should continue to promote AI growth but must do so in a way that upholds intellectual 
property rights, including, and in this case specifically, copyrights of all types. Ensuring 
transparency in AI training data, supporting a  creation, management and  licensing framework, and 
rejecting broad fair use claims will help maintain a nd ensure a balanced approach that benefits both 
AI innovation and the creative economy without putting companies and artists out of business . By 
reinforcing these principles, the U.S. can lead the way in AI development while respecting and 
protecting the rights of content creators.
