Good morning I’m Christophe Petit, the director of the Ethical AI Training Organizati on. I 
believe that the issue of ethical AI training will be one of the most profound issues we will face 
in the very near future. Ethical AI is the civil rights movement of our time. I wanted to share 
with you a bill I drafted called the "AI Training Transparency Act." It’s a mock up that is just 
meant to be symbolic in nature, a nd I know there’s probably some overlap with bills that are 
already in the works. It is my hope that some of the ideas make their way into existing proposals 
or that it inspires you in your quest to form common sense AI guidelines. I have attached the pdf 
of the bill to this comment. The bill simply s eeks to accomplish the following: - Mandate 
comprehensive record- keeping of data used to train AI systems. - Oblige AI companies to 
disclose their training data upon public request. - Establish a standardized framework for  AI 
training transparency. BILL OUTLINE TITLE: AI Training Transparenc y Act Sponsored by:
