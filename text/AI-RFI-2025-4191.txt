General Comment
Generative AI is not needed in today's world. It's only function is to take away from  artists and lower people's ability to think for
them selves. If it can't learn without access to everyone's data, copyright protected art and writing, it does not need to exist. It's energy and
water consum ption is also needlessly enorm ous. Save our planet, save our artists, save our writers, save our students. Shut down Gen AI
