General Comment
I would like a law that prevents AI com panies from  infringing on current copyright laws. There are people who are doing everything in
their power to destroy these m odels and it will get worse the longer this goes unaddressed. Plus was there a NASA study that found that
putting lim its in place can actually spur creative solutions? If that's the case then regulating the AI space m ight focus it into som ething even
m ore useful and productive than it already is. Considering how the Chinese AI com panies m anaged to innovate under the restrictions
placed on them  by the US, it looks like regulation is the way to go.
