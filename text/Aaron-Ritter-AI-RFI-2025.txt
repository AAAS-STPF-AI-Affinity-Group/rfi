An AI Action  Plan for the United States sh ould be adaptive and 
continuously update d to ensure sustained leadership in AI. When 
consi dering the essenti al elements required to foster innovation to 
advance national leade rship in A I, one must consider  not one, but 
multiple key components . The basic framework of these comp onen ts 
should alig n with ethical  and responsible AI development, 
strengthening  national security, promoting economic growth, and 
fostering innovation within the AI ecos ystem.  These components should 
include:  
Resear ch and Development : 
-Leveraging part nerships between Universities and I ndustry will
reduce co st and create  a competitive  playing field  for the
development of responsible AI develop ment . This collaboration
will also reduce the burden on national lab programs , minimizing
the necessity  for grant funded resea rch and development .


Page | 2 -Centers of excellence shou ld be stablished in innovation critical
sectors such  as health care, defen se, and education . These centers
of excellence would allow for fiscally responsible oversight
without stifling  innovation .
-Consideration should  be made for investment in next generation
computing to enhan ce AI capabilities ac ross these critical secto rs
and centers of excellence.
Workforce Devel opment and Education : 
-The aforementioned centers of excellence provide a n environment
where public and private partnerships thrive. Arti ficial I ntelligen ce
certification programs and ongoing certification through these
partne rships  may generate apprenticeships  and learning
opportuniti es at a large scale.
-Introducing AI into STEM education at the K -12 level should be a
priority in education . Preparing young minds for the advanced AI
certification through advanced AI certification programs  pathways.
-Additional basic AI literacy  training and education  should be
provided at all levels  of education , universities , and workforce .
Ethics Safety and G overnance:  
-A National Artificial Intelligence Regulatory Framework should be
adopted in order to promote fair, accountable, and transparent
systems. The National Artificial  Intel ligence Initiative has
developed  the “Trustworthy Framewo rk” that address  6 key
com ponents of AI governance and safety.
-The regulatory framework should als o ensure th at human values
are considered in AI in order to minimize risk. This would reinforce
public tr ust by reducing discrimination  through unintended bias  or
mode degradation .


Page | 3 National S ecurity and Defense : 
-Utilizing AI to defend against adversarial threats  with autonomous
systems while ma intai ning huma n oversight.
-Cybersecurity , threat detection , and  mitigation capabilities  that
are AI powered and have human oversight wou ld enhance
national security and reduce the burden on enforcement  agencies.
Artificial I ntelligence for Economic Growth and Globa l Competi tiveness : 
-Provide support for international AI cooperation by utilizing
centers of excellence and credentialing to engage in AI global
standard  setting.
-Setting the standard  globally through innovative collaboration
between universities and industry  creates a fiscally responsible
standard that maintains leadership dominance.
Artific ial Intelligence Publi c Sector I nnovation:  
-Investments in AI driven public se rvice s and health care
improvements improves and increases e fficiency and reduces cost.
-Research into AI driven solutions for energy  conservation and
disaster res ponse are examples of sustaina ble AI generated return
on investment.
Artificial I ntell igence Policy and Public Trust:  
-Transparency and explainability in all models used
-Public en gagement through academic and indu stry collaboration
to promote education  and beneficial AI use  cases.
-AI Bill of Rights: I mplement a framework protecti ng indi vidual
rights in AI interactions.


Page | 4 Action s to be taken to Achie ve National A rtificial I ntelligence Leadership 
Objectives  and Implement a National AI Action Plan : 
1.Research and Devel opment I nvestment  Actions :
-Expand National AI Research I nstitutes  by funding at least 10 new
AI resea rch hu bs in colla boration with leading universities and
private sec tor partners.
-Increasing NSF and DARPA AI R&D budge ts by allo cating additional
funds to NSF, DARPA, and DOE for fundamental AI research.
-Offer $500M in innovation prizes through AI Grand Challenges for
brea kthroughs in quant um AI , Health care AI , and autonomous
systems.
-Estimated Budge t: $20 -25B over 5 years
2.Workfor ce Development and Education  Actions:
-Integrate AI curriculum  into K -12 education al programs  school s
and universities through government  grants .
-Establish apprenticeships thr ough centers of excell ence and public
private partnerships.
-Create AI workforce retaining grants to provide a $5000 grant fo r
worker transition to AI -related  roles.
-Estimated Budget : $10B over 5 years
3.Establish a  National AI Safety and Ethics Office responsible for AI
governance and risk assessment .
-Mandate AI impact assessment  and return on investment prior to
implementing high impact AI s ystems.


Page | 5 -Develop a regulatory AI Sandbox within government  to allow
companies to test AI applications under regulatory oversight prior
to full scale deployment.
-Budget $5B over 5 years
4.AI National Security and Defense:
Actions:
-Fund AI drive n cybersecurity initiatives and  AI powered detection
of cyber defense
-Enhance military intelligence applicati ons through autonomous
threat analysis with human oversight .
-Launch AI for National De fense Initiative: Establish a secure AI
driven clo ud infras tructure for defense -related AI  infra structure.
-Estimated Budget : $25B over 5 years
5.AI economic growth and global competitive ness  development
Action:
-Tax incentives for AI start u ps.
-Expand AI adoption grants to encourage integration and AI feature
development.
-Develop an expo rt strategy to promote U.S. AI products and
servi ces globally and att ract foreign investment.
-Estimated Budget : $15B over 5 years
6.AI and Public Se ctor Innovation Action:
-Deploy AI in federal agencies  for fraud detection and benefits
processing


Page | 6 -Develop National AI data sharing framework for A I researchers
that is secure and ethical
-Launch AI powered energy modeling projects
-Estimated Budget : $10B over 5 years
7.AI Policy and Public Trust Action:
-Enact AI transparency laws and systems that disclose when AI is
used
-Develop public AI literacy campai gn
-Create a  National Ombudsman Offi ce for AI related complaints
and ensure accountability
-Estimated Budget: $5B over 5 year s
Total  Estimated  Budget : $90 -100B Over 5 years  
This budget aligns with the investments made by current  AI leaders 
(China and EU) and ensures that the US re mains at the foref ront of AI 
leadership. Funding resources may include:  
-Federal Investment Fund
-Publ ic-Private Partne rships
-Reallocation of existing R&D budgets
-AI Specific Taxation (H igh Revenue AI business
These concrete actions , pai red with sustained government commitment 
and private sector collaboration , will position the U. S. as the worl d 
leader in AI innovation.
