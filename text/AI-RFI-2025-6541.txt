General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican and profits off of theft as AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. I refuse to consent to having anything especially photos and art being used for
any AI tools. AI is unethical and harm ful to everyone as m any Am ericans agree that AI holds no value or place in the US or anywhere in
the world and should not be encouraged as it is harm ful to our society. AI is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs,
with false prom ises to fool the public and huge legal problem s by enabling them . There is a lot of huge data security concerns regarding AI
as AI won't protect your inform ation and will m ake it easier for anyone to hack into and snag your personal data and inform ation. AI is
also harm ful to the environm ent as the proliferating data centres that house AI servers produce electronic waste, are large consum ers of
water, which is becom ing scarce in m any places, rely on critical m inerals and rare elem ents, which are often m ined unsustainably, use
m assive am ounts of electricity, and spurs the em ission of planet-warm ing greenhouse gases.
