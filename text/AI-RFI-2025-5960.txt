General Comment
At present AI produces bilge on the basis of m ass IP theft, it can produce that bilge in vast quantities at high volum e and is incapable of
being reviewed for veracity, hallucinations etc. as rapidly as it is capable of being produced.
The NSF in producing an action plan for AI m ust not act with com plete disregard for copyrights and patents or intellectual property law. I
find it ludicrous that the NSF wants to establish theft as policy, especially in light of Sam  Altm an's frequent public declarations that Open
AI is unprofitable without m assive IP theft, it sounds like his product isn't econom ically com petitive and shouldn't receive a governm ent
agency contract or sanction. The notion that National Security, Econom ic com petitiveness, let alone hum an flourishing can only happen
when Open AI is allowed to corrupt data and (continue) to steal the intellectual property of others is idiotic. Open AI's com m ercial uses
are com ically unreliable, and should not be allowed unfettered access to the intellectual property they have not paid for, let alone
governm ent system s.
