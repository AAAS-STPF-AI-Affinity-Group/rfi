General Comment
Generative AI does not hold a place in the future of the US, and is a speculative m arket sim ilar to cryptocurrency and NFTs. It only has
false prom ises to fool the public and would lead to m any legal problem s if they are enabled. Generative AI also steals from  the livelihoods
of Am ericans and profits off of theft. It is overhyped, and fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. Ai is just a speculative bubble waiting
to pop like Nortel. NVIDIA's $600B m arket cap drop was NOT an accident.
