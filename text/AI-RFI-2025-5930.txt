General Comment
All I can say is I am  wholly against this plan. This is personally a huge step backwards for Am erica as a whole. I was fine at first if it was
related to m edical needs and the like, but now its com pletely taking over alm ost everything. Two things I am  especially against is the use of
AI in art and calling it real art and using AI to replicate voices. This is not only taking away opportunities for artists and voice actors, in
addition now if they don't com ply or stand against AI, com panies can now just say "we don't need you then" and replace them . Or in
som e cases, replace them  with no prior contact. Yes this act of replacing individuals to non com pliance has been a thing since before AI.
It is just now that doing so because they wanted to protect their rights and took a stand against som ething harm ful is m orally wrong. I
honestly hope that thus plan is stopped in its tracks!
