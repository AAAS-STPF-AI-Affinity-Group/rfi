General Comment
Allowing AI to “learn” from  copyrighted m aterial without com pensating the original creators is the m ost anti-capitalistic sentim ent I can
think of. It’s ridiculous and I don’t understand why it’s even being entertained. Then there is the enorm ous am ount of water these
com puting system s use, putting a trem endous strain on one of our m ost vital natural resources. The race for this technology should not
take precedence over Am erican citizens livelihoods and the health of the planet.
