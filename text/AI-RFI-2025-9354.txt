General Comment
It doesn't m atter if you're the first with AI technology, did you learn nothing from  DeepSeek? If you put it out there, it'll just get stolen
again and again and again, opening up security risks for the Am erican people because you believe that the regurgitating word m achine is
telling you the truth. AI is lying to you, the people behind AI are lying to you and you're going to end up investing m oney in technology that
doesn't exist and won't work.
This plan is a WASTE.
