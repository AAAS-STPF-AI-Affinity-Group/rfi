General Comment
I strongly oppose the protection and expansion of AI. The use of AI steals the livelihoods of Am erican citizens when com panies believe
they can cut corners by using this highly volatile tool. AI is trained on the intellectual property of others and often outputs results that are
low-quality and often inaccurate.
When we let AI use becom e com m on, we signal that we as a nation condone and are com fortable with low-quality, second-hand results
that stom p over our own citizens. Please consider opposing AI for the sake of us all.
