General Comment
Allowing LLMs and other AI businesses to steal the work of others without com pensation infringes on copyright practices and is highly
unethical. As an artist and writer, I deserve to have what I create be protected, and so does every other hum an being. AI should not be
allowed to steal what it has not labored to m ake.
