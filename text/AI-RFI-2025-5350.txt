General Comment
I believe that for the betterm ent of Am erican society and global society that the use of AI should be contained to develop itself via its
owner’s legally owned property and no one else’s. AI is not poised to im prove society at large, rather it is a cheap facsim ile of the hum an
touch in the world to try to m axim ize shareholder profits at the expense of the livelihoods of all citizens (the people who actually m ake the
training data). At best it is a silly tool that a lot of investors were bam boozled into spending far too m uch m oney on developing, at worst it
is a way to fire the entire working class into irrelevance and that later option would prove detrim ental to stability, life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness, underm ining the ability of the average Am erican to survive and underm ining the foundation of our country and
econom ic system . AI should not be allowed to hurt the Am erican citizenry and I fear the im plications of letting it loose on us all will be
devastating in the long run.
Thank you for your tim e.
