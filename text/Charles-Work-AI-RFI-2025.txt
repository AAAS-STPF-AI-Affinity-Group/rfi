I am writing in opposition to the AI action plan.   As I see it, this plan would use MY work and
my data, without any compensation to me, without my permission, to train AI models.   We
would have no knowledge of what   our personal data,   any writings or images we've created,
or even photos of ourselves and our loved ones would be used for.   These could be using my
writing to create scams to cheat seniors of their pension checks.   They could use my artwork,
and photos of me and my family, to create raciast or explicit images (even child exploitative
material!) without my knowledge.   They could use what I've created to create deepfakes,
hoaxes   and misinformation   and interfere with our elections.
I do not consent to any of this.   I don't want my work, my art, or my family's photos and data
used without my consent or knowledge, but I can't do anything about it, unless you allPLEASE stop this plan at once.
  Otherwise, are you able to provide me one iota of reassurance
that these large language models aren't stealing from me in order to hurt people?
