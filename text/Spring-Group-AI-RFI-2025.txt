 2. Executive Summary
 In the past few years, the rise of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) has become a powerful force 
 that cannot be underestimated. The varied uses and purposes of AI technology have 
 pervaded everyday life, from its usage in the classroom to national security concerns. 
 Furthermore, as AI brings many beneﬁts to society, it also brings about conversations 
 regarding its ethical use. Many wonder how AI can be implemented in a way that will not 
 only offer technological innovation and forward-thinking into society but also be used 
 safely to minimize its potential threats. 
 Artiﬁcial intelligence and its progress is a topic of importance to the SPRING Group. As 
 an organization composed of students who are young adults, we will be the next 
 generation that has to interact with various AI technologies as it is further integrated 
 into our greater society. Therefore, we are especially concerned about the methods in 
 which AI will be implemented, for these decisions made by the federal government will 
 impact our own daily lives as AI continues to gain traction. 
 As part of our continued goal to highlight youth viewpoints on issues of concern to 
 them, SPRING seeks to bring the unique perspectives of students into national policies 
 such as artiﬁcial intelligence. This brief starts with an analysis of the status quo 
 concerning AI technologies and their relationships in the ﬁeld of education, then 
 provides curriculum-based policy recommendations and external policy 
 recommendations to further the development of AI in a safe yet engaging manner.

 3. Introduction
 AI has greatly changed education in the United States. With abilities spanning from the 
 creation of lesson plans to the generation of a fully ﬂeshed essay in a matter of 
 minutes, its implementation has caused lots of discussion regarding student utilization, 
 the role of teachers, and how it promotes equity in learning. 
 According to a global survey by the Digital Education Council, 86 percent of students 
 reported using artiﬁcial intelligence in their studies.  1  As a result, concerns have been 
 raised over academic integrity and the overall net beneﬁt of utilizing artiﬁcial 
 intelligence in the classroom. While assigned work is meant to bring out critical thinking 
 and direct application of the topics learned, AI tools have the power to completely 
 mitigate this intention by providing instant answers and even removing the need for 
 student effort. It is imperative that students can use AI in a way that beneﬁts their 
 knowledge while still being mindful of the guidelines in place and meeting the cor e 
 objectives. 
 AI has also signiﬁcantly impacted teachers. Instead of seeing the technology as a 
 replacement, AI can be made for support that enhances their methods in the classroom. 
 The tool can increase eﬃciency, ensure that all standards are being met, and overcome 
 any challenges along the way. 
 The educational divide in the United States is necessary to consider. The divide 
 unfortunately affects millions, as certain groups face disparities in their access to 
 education. Factors include socioeconomic status, family background, location, ethnicity, 
 and gender. AI has features that can address or supplement some of these issues, such 
 as assisting learning for students in institutions with lower faculty counts.

 4. Status Quo Analysis
 4.1 Pros of AI Use in Education 
 One of the most important ways AI is used in education is in personalized learning 
 systems, which use adaptable algorithms to change the lessons based on each 
 student's level of skill, preferred learning style, and speed. The systems keep an eye on 
 how students interact with each other, their behavior, and their performance so that they 
 can change parts of the curriculum immediately, without needing time to adjust. This 
 way, each student gets individualized teaching instead of a standard, one-size-ﬁts-all 
 approach. By giving each student personalized material to help them learn, adaptive 
 learning technologies can boost retention by up to 30%  2  . 
 Intelligent teaching systems (ITS) are another important step forward in education that 
 is being driven by AI. These methods work like one-on-one lessons because they give 
 immediate and detailed feedback, break down harder ideas, and ﬁnd trouble spots in 
 real time. For instance, Carnegie Learning's AI-powered tutor, MATHia, has shown 
 measurable improvements in math skills, with the average student showing a 16 
 percentile point improvement compared to traditional classroom teaching  3  . 
 AI-powered tutors give students instant feedback on how they can improve, so they can 
 change their strategies right away. A study that compared students using AI-assisted 
 learning tools to a control group found that the students in the experimental group who 
 used the AI-assisted tool did better on writing projects than the students in the control 
 group  4  . 
 Aside from teaching, AI has also been used to handle administrative tasks, which gives 
 teachers more time to focus on their teaching duties. AI-driven grading systems, like the 
 ones in Gradescope, use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to 
 look over student work. This makes grades more uniform and faster  5  . Using these 
 automated systems can cut down on grading time by a large amount, giving teachers 
 more time to work on developing lessons and teaching students  6  .

 7 
 One of the best things about AI-powered learning tools is that they can get students 
 more interested in learning. Studies show that students are more motivated and 
 involved in class when the tools they are using are tailored to their speciﬁc cognitive 
 needs  7  . By making sure that instructional content stays relevant and easy to ﬁnd, AI 
 stops students from losing interest, which can happen when the pace of the teacher 
 doesn't meet the level of understanding of the students. 
 Programs like Estonia's national AI reading program show how AI-driven lessons can 
 help close the achievement gap  8  . Working with leading U.S. tech companies, the 
 program wants to add AI-driven classes to high school to give kids more advanced 
 digital skills that will help them get jobs in tech-based economies. This model shows 
 how AI can change education by getting rid of barriers like distance and money that 
 make it hard to provide eﬃcient teaching. 
 4.2 Cons of AI Use in Education 
 The integration of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in educational institutions presents 
 numerous advantages, although it has also engendered certain issues that require 
 thorough examination. Issues include academic dishonesty, the erosion of critical 
 thinking abilities, and the perpetuation of biases throughout generations. They provide 
 signiﬁcant hazards to the educational sector. 
 The incidence of students engaging in academic dishonesty on projects has escalated 
 due to the utilization of AI technologies such as ChatGPT, which can generate text that 
 resembles human writing. Sixty-three percent of educators reported having to 
 reprimand pupils for utilizing generative AI to cheat during the 2023–24 academic 
 year  9  10  . This represented a substantial rise compared to the prior year. AI technologies 
 enhance the learning experience; yet, they have also elicited concerns regarding 
 academic integrity and the genuine comprehension of students who utilize them  11  . 
 The use of AI-generated content may impede critical thinking and proﬁcient writing 
 skills. Students may rely on AI tools for idea generation and content creation, thus 
 diminishing their critical thinking skills and originality. Educators are concerned that

 8 
 such reliance may result in a generation of kids deﬁcient in essential cognitive 
 abilities  12  . 
 The ease with which students can complete assignments without a compr ehensive 
 comprehension of the subject renders AI a valuable tool for academic dishonesty. The 
 educational process is obstructed, preventing teachers from accurately assessing each 
 student's true capabilities. Schools can safeguard academic integrity by implementing 
 honor codes and utilizing AI detection techniques to identify content generated by 
 artiﬁcial intelligence  13  . 
 Establishing AI-operated assessment tools has proven to be challenging. These 
 methodologies may overlook the nuances of individual expression and creativity, 
 perhaps resulting in inaccurate assessments of student work. AI systems have been 
 demonstrated to perpetuate biases inherent in their training data. This renders learning 
 inequitable for certain pupils and may place them at a disadvantage  14  . 
 Frequently, AI assessment systems perpetuate biases due to the presence of inherent 
 biases in the training data  15  . This may result in inequitable assessments and exacerbate 
 disparities  16  . To address this issue, developers must ensure that AI systems are trained 
 on diverse and representative datasets  17  . Moreover, maintaining the currency of AI 
 algorithms and scrutinizing for bias can enhance the accuracy and equity of ratings. 
 AI has the potential to revolutionize education, but it also presents signiﬁcant 
 challenges, such as facilitating cheating, undermining critical thinking, and 
 disseminating biased information. Policymakers must address these issues. The 
 education sector can leverage AI while mitigating its drawbacks, provided effective 
 regulations are established. This will ensure that technology enhances learning rather 
 than detracting from it.

 5. Curriculum-based Policy Recommendations
 Given the rapidly evolving nature of artiﬁcial intelligence from a social and political 
 perspective, it is essential to develop policies from an educational standpoint that 
 ensure proper usage of artiﬁcial intelligence. In a Pew Research study, the usage of AI 
 for schoolwork has gone from 13% in 2023 to roughly 26% as of 2025. To advance 
 education quality and promote high-quality learning structures that are reﬂective of a 
 diverse range of educational environments, reforms from an educational standpoint 
 must be addressed regarding AI usage for both teachers and students. 
 5.1 Mandatory AI Education Training for Teachers 
 Introducing a mandate on artiﬁcial intelligence literacy training for educators is an 
 effective means of handling the increasing rate of AI mishandling from an educational 
 standpoint. Though artiﬁcial intelligence is an effective form of streamlining 
 administrative tasks and everyday operations, teachers must learn the ethicality of 
 artiﬁcial intelligence and understand the potential implications and biases within its 
 structure. In a survey of 205 educators by Teach Plus, a nonproﬁt organization, 92% 
 stated that artiﬁcial intelligence has the potential to be helpful to their teaching 
 methods, but only half knew how to use it effectively and eﬃciently. Introducing a policy 
 that comprehensively educates teachers on how to utilize AI effectively and eﬃciently 
 without sacriﬁcing the quality of their work will signiﬁcantly enhance the learning 
 experience of students and the management of time for learning fr om a teacher's 
 perspective. On top of a required AI brieﬁng upon employment at an educational 
 institution, training will be mandated to occur once every two academic school years, 
 but recommended once every academic school year, to remain cognisant to the rapidly 
 evolving nature of AI. This training will include 3 comprehensive subsections to be 
 administered to educators and reviewed thoroughly. 
 The ﬁrst part of the training would encompass the basic structural nature of artiﬁcial 
 intelligence, reviewing how it works from an algorithmic standpoint, and its potential 
 uses in a daily learning environment, like scheduling tasks, planning the organizational 
 structure of daily learning, developing creative approaches to learning activities, and 
 displaying methods to engage with students to optimize wellbeing and educational 
 success. 
 The second part of the training will cover the key administrative issues with AI. These 
 include but are not limited to: 
 ● AI hallucinations, which is when AI chatbots conjure up untrue information.


 10 
 ●  AI alignment, which is when AI does not perform what it is instructed to do in a 
 highly subtle manner. 
 ●  AI runaway, which is when the AI chatbot develops answers that stray from the 
 request of the user. 
 ●  AI discrimination, which is when AI provides information that is discriminatory 
 due to statistical bias and discriminatory skews in online research. 
 ●  AI “lock-in” problem, which is when AI narrows the context of the user’s prompt 
 and neglects the broader picture of the situation/circumstance/prompt that the 
 user provides. 
 These issues remain imperative for educators to learn before overutilization AI in ways 
 that directly harm the well-being and educational attainment of their students. 
 The third and last unit will be educating teachers on how to identify AI mishandling 
 within students while making an appropriate response to it. On top of providing teachers 
 with methods to promote the ethical usage of AI within the classroom, teachers will 
 learn how to identify the usage of AI within a student’s work. Some examples of 
 detection include comparing the style of homework submitted by a student to previous 
 assignments, with the AI version having higher levels of vocabulary, an overly formal 
 tone with a lack of creativity, and a lack of personal information to attribute a piece of 
 writing to a speciﬁc writer. However, more than simply identifying AI, this unit will 
 educate teachers on how to appropriately respond and teach students not to utilize AI. 
 When caught using AI, teachers will approach the situation holistically, meeting with the 
 student to identify areas of concern and developing a comprehensive plan to ensure the 
 student's success in the future. After more than one disciplinary infraction related to AI 
 usage, a higher level of disciplinary action will occur. 
 5.2 Mandatory AI Literacy Workshops for Students 
 However, it is further essential for students to be educated on the ethical usage of AI 
 that beneﬁts their education while enhancing their knowledge of using AI. Exposing 
 students to technological innovations from a young age will increase a student’s career 
 development and ability to succeed. To ensure AI is as beneﬁcial as possible to a 
 student, a comprehensive AI literacy workshop will occur once a year with an emphasis 
 on optimizing a student’s time, learning, and socioemotional development. Though 
 similar to the teacher’s AI teaching curriculum, the workshops for students will be heard 
 to the receiving end of the education with 4 overviews of AI and ways to be used from a 
 student perspective. 


 11 
 Though the potential uses of AI are growing rapidly, students will be taken through an 
 overview of AI and how it works, then how it can be used from a student perspective. 
 Examples include developing comprehensive homework scheduling structures, 
 providing unit or curriculum explanations, developing study methods that are catered to 
 the user, and more.

 6. Other Policy Recommendations
 This section focuses on recommendations outside of altering the school curriculum. 
 Due to concerns about AI’s security and use of data, this section mainly tackles 
 recommendations regarding AI privacy and data protection, AI ethics, and partnerships 
 with schools. 
 6.1 Student Privacy and Data Protection 
 6.1.1 AI Transparency 
 AI trust is essential for its use in schools and education. Speciﬁcally, AI tools should be 
 able to provide clear, understandable explanations for their decisions, predictions, and 
 recommendations to whoever uses them, which in this case would be students. 
 Furthermore, AI models should be fully transparent so that teachers, students, and 
 parents can understand how AI impacts education. This sort of transparency is 
 necessary to create trust between AI and its use in school and further education and to 
 ensure that students are not only going to be able to learn from AI, but they won’t be 
 able to solely rely on it.  18  This means mandating transparency reports on how certain 
 models function and the data used to train them to ensure that the model and the 
 output information are unbiased and can complement learning rather than replace it. 
 6.1.2 AI Privacy and Data Protection for Students 
 Data protection is one of the most dangerous parts of AI use, with data potentially being 
 used to create internal biases. Thus, a framework should be created and designed to 
 protect against student data collection, storage, and use by AI systems. This should 
 include policies limiting the amount of data being collected, a clear opt-in and opt-out 
 mechanism about data collection, and encryption standards to protect student data 
 from misuse or cyberattacks. Any sort of regulation should also follow the Family 
 Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which acts as the current student privacy 
 regulation.  19
 6.1.3 AI Certiﬁcation and Testing 
 All AI education tools should meet certain safety, reliability, and transparency standards 
 before being deployed in schools to ensure that it is ready to be used at a student level. 
 This can be similar to FDA approval but more focused on AI safety within education use. 
 19  U.S. Department of Education, n.d.  18  Lawton, 2024 


 13 
 These AI systems should be aligned with educational goals and testing for tr ansparency 
 is crucial to maintain privacy laws and frameworks both in parallel with frameworks in 
 this paper as well as outside acts. An easy way to determine if AI matches certain 
 standards would be to create a certiﬁcation program that performs independent 
 veriﬁcation on AI tools before they are used within schools. Certiﬁcation programs can 
 provide an approval if they match high safety, reliability, and transparency standards 
 that protect students and others who use the AI. 
 6.2 AI Ethics 
 6.2.1 Bias Audits 
 AI use has always been highlighted with critiques about the ethics of AI and how it 
 manages biases. Due to the way AI is trained on past data, it can often mirror certain 
 stereotypes and biases that are found in the data and perpetuate or even amplify them 
 during use, which is detrimental when used in school.  20  Thus, all AI educational tools 
 should have independent audits performed on them to detect and mitigate biases in 
 algorithms, particularly those that could disproportionately affect marginalized 
 students. Through methods like ethics checklists and frameworks, independent 
 auditors can focus on different dimensions of ethical AI, such as fairness, explainability, 
 and safety, and evaluate the AI through those means before they are used in the 
 educational system. 
 6.2.2 Safety Compliance 
 Most, if not all, educational technology tools follow stricter guidelines than tools offered 
 to the broader public, mainly because the people who use educational tools are mostly 
 young students and children who are easily inﬂuenced. Regulations like FERPA and 
 COPPA, as well as other state laws, are required for tools used in the educational 
 sphere.  21  Educational AI tools should follow in these footsteps and be required to 
 adhere to those guidelines and even more that speciﬁcally tailor to AI. This also 
 includes clear penalties for companies that violate any of those r egulations while 
 simultaneously encouraging the development of AI tools speciﬁcally for education. 
 6.2.3 Accessibility Enhancements 
 A wide range of students often need AI in their learning, whether they simply need some 
 help with tutoring services or whether they are under special education and need tools 
 21  Mann et. al., 2024  20  Greene-Santos, 2024 


 14 
 to help in their unique learning needs, often requiring specialized educational 
 programs.  22  Currently, technologies like assistive technology in speech-to-text tools are 
 already used to help with special education and can be further augmented with AI. AI in 
 classrooms should include assistive technologies that enhance accessibility for 
 students with various conditions, such as text-to-speech and vice-versa tools, adaptive 
 learning tools, and specialized AI tutor tools. However, these AI tools must meet 
 standards under the Americans with Disability Act to be used in schools for such use. 
 6.3 School Partnerships 
 6.3.1 AI Partnership for Schools 
 AI use is commonly documented by the federal government regarding different use 
 cases from student aid to create public policy analysis. With this high oversight by the 
 government regarding different uses of AI, the government should create a 
 federal-private partnership regarding AI use in education to create a connection 
 between the government, tech companies, and schools to develop safe and effective AI 
 tools. This partnership should include strict compliance standards for AI systems and 
 models while ensuring accessibility for underfunded schools. Federal funding for 
 underfunded schools to access such AI tools can also be involved and be a part of 
 these partnerships while driving innovation and maintaining high standards from AI so 
 that students can use those models safely. 
 6.3.2 Teacher AI Training 
 AI should be understood and utilized by students but teachers as well. Teachers will 
 need proper training to fully understand and utilize AI to complement their teaching so 
 that they can ensure students can properly learn using AI without having it do all of the 
 work and take away from the learning. Thus, there should be a federal program 
 dedicated to funding and creating specialized AI literacy and training programs for 
 teachers to ensure they understand AI risks, limitations, and potential. This training 
 should also help teachers integrate AI responsibly into their classrooms. Teachers must 
 be able to learn AI to use it and teach it effectively and safely.

 7. Conclusion
 Artiﬁcial intelligence is one of the most revolutionary technologies in recent memory, 
 and it is more prevalent than ever before in American history. As a youth-centered policy 
 research team, the SPRING Group aimed to investigate the current state of AI 
 technology in the classroom, as well as potential policy goals the White House could 
 implement to ensure a safer, more eﬃcient, and equitable future for American students. 
 Artiﬁcial intelligence has already transformed the United States educational workplace, 
 from improving instructional delivery in the form of artiﬁcial tutors, streaming 
 administrative eﬃciency in the form of AI grading systems, and even personalizing 
 individual student assistance with personalized, adaptive learning systems. These 
 systems increase student engagement and optimize instructor eﬃciency, leading to an 
 overall positive learning environment. This isn’t just a theory; countries around the world 
 are churning out initiatives to expand AI literacy and integrate AI-driven curricula, and 
 they’re showcasing positive results. 
 At the same time, AI perpetuates many negative impacts, as well, such as a rise in 
 academic dishonesty, the erosion of critical thinking skills, and the exacerbation of 
 hidden biases against marginalized students. 
 However, policies can be implemented to strike a balance between the potentially 
 life-changing beneﬁts and the system-transforming negatives artiﬁcial intelligence can 
 have in the classroom. AI is already being used in the classroom by both students and 
 teachers, so the integration of mandatory AI education training for both constituencies 
 will help foster a healthy technological environment. Beyond the classroom, privacy and 
 ethical policies must be rigorously implemented. AI models used in education must 
 meet rigorous standards for transparency and security to avoid biases and ensure that 
 student data remains safe. AI models must pass stringent security and safety 
 standards and remain accessible to all students, regardless of special educational 
 needs. Finally, governments must partner with schools to ensure the equitable and safe 
 distribution of AI resources. 
 The SPRING Group remains vehemently committed to the fostering of a safe, reliable 
 artiﬁcial intelligence national framework to usher in the next generation of American 
 leadership in AI. We believe AI leadership begins with our youngest generation, and 
 creating safe and innovative policies today ensures that America will stand out on the 
 international stage of artiﬁcial intelligence development.
