General Comment
Allowing AI, which has questionable abilities in regard to accurate representation, use m ore than what is legally purchased for that reason
is not a viable choice.
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US for m any reasons. It takes m oney from  creators, underm ines copyright law and
can be used m aliciously.
Those tooting AI do so purely for their own benefit. It is overhyped, annoying and essentially theft.
