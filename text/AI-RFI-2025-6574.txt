General Comment
I do not believe OpenAI should be able to scrape the internet or use the intellectual property of others without licensing agreem ents. If
their m odels require intellectual labor and property of others, they can pay for it like any other com pany. 
Com panies like OpenAI are unnecessary for the future of the United States. Most of their m odels are full of errors and have proved
em barrassing when used in the legal profession (m y field). At any rate, OpenAI should not be given special privileges above other for-
profit com panies which, despite protestations or a veneer of research, is what they are.
