General Comment
As a sm all business owner, I strongly believe in the potential of AI, but I also believe in fairness and respect for intellectual property. My
business is built on original content, and we work hard to produce high-quality recipes, photography, writing, and editorial work.
I em ploy twelve full-tim e team  m em bers, including chefs, photographers, writers, a financial m anager, a business m anager, editorial
m anager, and a social m edia m anager. Together, we create original, high-value content that fuels the internet’s food and lifestyle space.
Like m any independent publishers, m y business depends on our content rem aining ours—not being taken without consent or
com pensation.
I have two key concerns:
AI training m ust respect copyright law. Large com panies like Google and OpenAI should not be allowed to scrape, use, or repurpose our
work without explicit perm ission and fair com pensation. Just as the m usic industry evolved to protect artists and ensure proper licensing,
the sam e protections m ust extend to ALL publishers, not just the largest m edia corporations.
Tech giants m ust not profit from  stolen content. No com pany should be allowed to ingest independent creators' content, censor output,
control the narrative, or profit off of our work without perm ission. Any entity engaging in this behavior should face strict legal
consequences.
We are at a pivotal m om ent in AI developm ent. The choices m ade now will determ ine whether independent creators can survive or
whether tech m onopolies will exploit sm all businesses out of existence. AI cannot exist without content. And without fair com pensation for
content creators, the system  collapses.
I urge you to take action to ensure transparency, fair licensing, and strong legal protections for sm all businesses like m ine. It’s tim e to
m ake AI developm ent sustainable for everyone, not just a handful of corporations.
Thank you for your tim e and consideration.
Sincerely,
Katerina
