General Comment
I strongly believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has no significant benefit to the future of Am erica. 
The unchecked advancem ent and usage of AI seeks only to alienate and threaten hum an creators in a variety of fields, and to further
com m odify the products of professions to which m any Am ericans have dedicated their lives. The usage of AI generated m edia (im ages,
video, voice-overs, etc.) in lieu of m edia created by hum ans creates a deceitful and cheap im pression of the individuals or businesses
which use them , causing m ore harm  to one's reputation than reduced costs can justify.
I, and the vocal m ajority of other Am erican creators, feel strongly that ensuring the rapid developm ent of AI is far from  a crucial concern
for Am erica, and should not be treated as such.
