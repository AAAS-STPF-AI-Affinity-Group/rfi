General Comment
AI is a plague that is contributing to the fall of m odern society. AI art should not be protected. AI creations should be rem oved from
public view and not a single person should legally be allowed to m ake m oney off of anything generated via m achine learning. If action isn't
taken now to intensely regulate AI, so m any jobs will be lost and so m any lives will be ruined. Artists will no longer exist. We are spiraling
towards oblivion.
