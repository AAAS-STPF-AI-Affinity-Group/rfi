General Comment
AI in its current form  is nothing m ore than stolen works from  various form s of m edia, online, print, im ages, artwork, etc. rem oving ethical
guardrails creates a dangerous precedent and opens the door for nefarious foreign actors or enem y governm ents to create m isinform ation. 
Doing so would result in confused voters at the local level, also contribute to a m ass "Dum bing down" of childhood test scores, early data
is already showing kids in K-12 schools..both public and private...have an over reliance on Gem ini, ChatGPT, am ong others, I worry that
this would create a snowball effect 5, 10, 20 years from  now when m any of these students will be in the workforce and becom e
taxpayers.
