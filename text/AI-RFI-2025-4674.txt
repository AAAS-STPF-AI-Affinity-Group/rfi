General Comment
Art is such a huge industry in the United States (and internationally, too). Trying to replace it with m achines has already cost m any
Am erican artists their jobs, and will continue to do so unless AI is reigned in.
Also, the less hum an art that is created, the m ore future AI m odels will have to derive from  previous AI m odels, creating a never-ending
loop. This will be a dead end for art, which is a travesty.
