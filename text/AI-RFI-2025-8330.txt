General Comment
AI as it exists today is nothing m ore than a plagiarism  m achine. It is not "trained" on other people's work so m uch as it outright steals other
people's work and then rem ixes it into som ething that is soulless and m ediocre. Musk and Altm an don't want to com pensate the owners of
copyrighted works that they use for their AI m odels, they want to outright steal it, and not even give copyright owners the option to opt
out. This is theft, pure and sim ple, and if their business m odel depends on theft, then they have a terrible business m odel. Furtherm ore, it is
clear just how com pletely unreliable AI is; all you have to do is search anything online using AI and you will see answers that are just plain
wrong. As a person working in IT, I can say that the only acceptable use of AI is when it is using data from  a controlled, validated data
set that is thoroughly vetted and tested to ensure it is producing the correct results. This is not what Musk, Altm an, Zuckerberg, Google,
et al are doing - they are stealing content to stick into a m assive data lake that is not vetted or validated in any way, and they are not
properly fine-tuning the results. AI, particularly OpenAI, is theft. It's not usable and it's not safe, and it is the exact opposite of intelligent.
Stop trying to replace living, breathing, THINKING hum an beings with m achines. The tech is just not there yet.
