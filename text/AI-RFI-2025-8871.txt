General Comment
As a constituent, do NOT let OpenAI use copyrighted m aterial to train their AI, as it is STEALING! I don't think AI has a place in the
future of the U.S.A. It steals jobs, it steals m aterial, and it consum es so m uch energy to not successful results for the effort. Again, it steals
from  the livelihood of Am ericans and profits off theft instead of providing ingenuity.
Please stop OpenAI from  running ram pant and m aking things worse. If you allow them  to do what they please, there's no reversing what
dam age will be done.
