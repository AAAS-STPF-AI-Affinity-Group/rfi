Response to Request for Information (RFI) on the De velopment of an 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan 
Thank you for the opportunity to c omment on the Administration’s eff orts to ensure 
America’s global leadership in artificial intelligence. We commend the White House Office of 
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) for seeking public input on the Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) Action Plan, which seeks to foster innovation, promote human flourishing, and maintain 
U.S. competitiveness in AI.  
Below, w e outline a set of re commendations focused on strengthening the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS)—particularly the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)—to maximize AI’s benefits, address associated risks, and support the Administration’s 
vision for American AI leadership. We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with OSTP on 
ensuring that AI improves the health and wellbeing of all Americans, and we would be 
delighted to discuss our proposals with you further.

Recommendations 
AI stands poised to not only revolutionize healthc are but also transform every aspect of HHS, 
offering unmatched opportunities to enhance patient outcomes, streamline administrative 
functions, bolster safety surveillance, and drive biomedical innovation. To realize these 
1 


 
advantages, a robust foundation that includes workforce development, data readiness, 
regulatory refinement, and staff engagement must be in place. At present, much of the federal 
workforce lacks specialized AI expertise, creating adoption delays that may hinder progress and 
compromise America’s global AI leadership. This moment represents a critical opportunity for 
the Administration to affirm its commitment to advancing AI capabilities by providing 
strategic resources, leadership, and clear operational guidance under its AI Action Plan. 
 
Recommendation 1: Establish an AI Corps within HHS to accelerate the integration 
of AI across its agencies 
 
To unlock AI’s full potential within HHS, an AI Corps should be created to provide 
specialized expertise across the Department’s ten agencies. HHS is uniquely positioned for this 
investment, as it delivers critical healthcare services to millions of Americans and manages 
extensive healthcare data, oversees drug and device development, and addresses areas like 
healthcare fraud. Modeled after the Department of Homeland Security’s AI Corps, this 
program would recruit top-tier professionals in AI, machine learning, data science, and data 
engineering, who would bring the specialized knowledge necessary to integrate AI tools safely 
and effectively, optimize processes, and drive innovation within each agency. While current 
initiatives like the HHS AI Council and AI Community of Practice provide strategic guidance, 
they lack the capacity for hands-on, agency-level implementation. By embedding dedicated AI 
practitioners in each agency, HHS would move beyond high-level planning toward meaningful 
AI adoption, thereby fulfilling the intent of both the Executive Order and the proposed AI 
Action Plan.  
 
This policy recommendation was developed as part of the Federation of American Scientists 
(FAS)’s Day One Project (full memo available here). 
 
Recommendation 2: Strengthen the FDA ’s Regulatory Capacity through AI 
The pharmaceutical industry commonly cites review delays and limited interactions with the 
FDA as significant bottlenecks in drug approval processes. Although user fees can help fund 2 


 
additional staff, a more lasting and impactful solution lies in improving existing reviewers’ 
efficiency through AI. Proper integration of AI could expedite reviews, reduce costs, and yield 
faster patient access to innovative therapies. The following recommendations detail 
complementary steps to facilitate AI’s integration into FDA operations while preserving high 
regulatory standards. 
 
The following policy recommendations were developed for the Clinical Trials Abundance project,  
a partnership between the Institute for Progress (IFP) & Renaissance  Philanthropy, and 
presented at a policy workshop on October 7th, 2024 (full memo available here). 
Recommendation 2.a: The FDA Should Prioritize Data Readiness for AI 
Integration 
To prepare for seamless AI integration, the FDA must prioritize organizing its internal data 
systems with robust access and permission hierarchies. This will ensure that sensitive regulatory 
data is properly structured, accessible, and secure for future AI training and utilization. AI 
tools, particularly those designed for regulatory tasks, depend on clean, well-organized data to 
perform effectively. By categorizing and tagging datasets with clear access controls, the FDA can 
ensure that AI models are fine-tuned for specific regulatory needs while maintaining the 
highest standards of data security and privacy. This will also guarantee the confidentiality that 
sponsors expect from the FDA.  
Recommendation 2.b: The FDA should Conduct an FDA Reviewer Benchmark 
T est 
A formal benchmark test, led by the FDA’s Office of Digital Transformation and the Center of 
Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (CERSI), should evaluate how AI-assisted 
reviews compare to those conducted by human reviewers. This test could apply AI tools to past 
submissions that have already received approval, thereby helping the FDA understand how AI 
may influence review quality and speed. Publicizing the results would promote trust, 
demonstrate the FDA’s commitment to scientific rigor, and offer a clear indication of whether 
AI meets the agency’s standards for accuracy and thoroughness. 3 


 
Recommendation 2.c: The FDA should publish a report on AI procurement 
guidelines 
The FDA should publish and share with Congress a report on AI procurement practices, 
specifying whether advanced AI tools such as large language models are accessible for FDA 
reviewers. Congress may mandate such a report, but even in the absence of such a mandate, the 
FDA should conduct such an assessment and publish its findings in a report. This report 
would reveal any existing gaps and propose practical reforms to streamline AI procurement. By 
addressing issues that impede the acquisition of cutting-edge technologies, the FDA can equip 
its reviewers with the tools necessary to make regulatory processes more timely and robust. 
Recommendation 2.d: The FDA should Foster AI Adoption through T argeted 
Reviewer Engagement 
The FDA should proactively engage its reviewers in structured AI workshops and training 
sessions to familiarize them with emerging and available AI technologies. These sessions would 
help reviewers better utilize AI tools in regulatory processes and strengthen collaboration 
between AI experts and regulatory staff, ensuring that new tools are developed with direct 
input from reviewers. By building staff confidence in the capabilities of AI, these workshops 
would lay the groundwork for broader, more effective AI integration throughout the agency. 
Initially, external experts could lead these efforts, ensuring timely exposure to best practices. If 
established, the AI Corps could take on this role, deepening collaboration and accelerating AI 
integration across the agency.
