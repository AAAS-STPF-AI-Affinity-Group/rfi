General Comment
AI steals from  m y livelihood as an artist and is INHERENTLY a form  of plagiarism  as it only generates what it has been taught. 
Generative AI does not think, it is a series of statistically likely outcom es from  a given set or subset of data. 
This is not generating anything that has not existed before. 
If you allow AI to be able to be trained on copy written m aterial, you are m aking a m ockery of copyright law over the past century.
