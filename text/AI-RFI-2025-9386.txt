General Comment
AI, to begin with, takes stark advantage of a lack of regulatory action on the part of the artist to protect their work to train their data and
put out low effort clones of existing IP. 
To allow this plan to m ove forward is to cosign the naked theft of original properties and endanger the livelihoods of hundreds of
thousands of Am ericans, at ridiculous energy consum ption that has all but crippled com m unities unfortunate enough to be host to a data
center, all to satisfy the interests of corporations that do not wish to fairly com pensate their talent and are willing to worsen the quality of
life and art for and destroy the financial livelihoods of the Am erican people so long as their fiscal quota is m et. 
It is m y deepest hope that conscience finds those with the power to kill this plan do so expeditiously.
