General Comment
The destruction of legal structures for som ething as feckless and valueless as generative AI is the kind of decision that is in clear disregard
of every piece of available inform ation on the m atter.
Generative AI has seen consistent failure after failure on the m arket. Rewriting intellectual theft law to carve out a niche for this tech is an
act of brazen apathy for every person and entity that isn't actively bankrolling cam paigns. Not to m ention that the US has already lost its
"AI dom inance" given that other countries have produced sim ilar technology at a fraction of the cost. This is a blatant waste of tim e and
m oney for a governm ent that seem s to value "efficiency" although seem ingly only in nam e.
