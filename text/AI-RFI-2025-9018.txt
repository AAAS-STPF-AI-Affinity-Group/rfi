General Comment
Speaking as som eone deeply invested in the developm ent of technology, rem oving regulations set in place for Artificial Intelligence
technology is a horrible decision for the future of this country. AI com panies and their technology routinely steal the intellectual property of
Am erican artists, writers, and other creatives to train their m odels. Rem oving these "guardrails" would allow these organizations to
continue to infringe on people's copyrights without consequence. AI technology is also capable of creating deep fakes and generated
im agery that is increasingly indistinguishable from  real life, and allowing this technology to develop freely would m ake way for m ore and
m ore irresponsible uses, such as the spread of m isinform ation and disinform ation. In recent history, tech com panies routinely go all-in on
products or system s that do not benefit the general public and often serve as a waste of funding and resources. Cryptocurrency, NFTs,
and now AI. But this new "technology" is not just a waste of resources and taxpayer m oney, but a plight for the free-thinking people of
Am erica.
