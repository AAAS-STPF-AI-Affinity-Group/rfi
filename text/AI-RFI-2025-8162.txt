General Comment
It is, to put it m ildly, chilling to think that best work of hum an m inds could be devalued into an undifferentiated m ass of content for no
reason other than to allow energy-gulping m egacom puters to average it, plagiarize it, present the "content" as their own, and (here's the
point, of course) m onetize it.
Beyond all the distractions about the AI race writ large and AI's possible applications in other, unrelated fields-- when it com es to art (that
is, when it com es to question of "copyright"), the issue we're faced with is a sim ple one: it's a m atter of whether you value the work of the
hum an m ind as som ething singular and sacred or whether you assign it value only by its m ass, "books by the foot"-style, considering it
m ere grist to a feed to an indifferent m ill that will spit it out like so m uch chum . 
I am  proud m em ber of Team  Hum an and and passionately against anything that allows AI to consum e the work of hum an artists without
their explicit consent. I suspect hundreds of m illions of other people would be against it too, if they knew it about it-- and will be, when
they do.
