General Comment
Please keep the current copyright structure intact. I am  an artist who m akes a living selling the paintings I m ake. If copyright protections
are rem oved, corporations with far m ore resources can steal m y work and sell it instead. (Yes, AI training and scraping counts as
stealing.) How will that be fair? I have the skills. I do the work. I deserve to m ake the incom e from  m y labor and intellectual property, not
som e random  third party.
