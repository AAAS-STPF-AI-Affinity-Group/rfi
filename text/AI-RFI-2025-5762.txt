General Comment
I personally do not think that AI should have a place in the future for content such as voice acting, digital art, video m aking, etc. Too m any
tim es where I see art on google and it turns out to be just AI generated. I am  also not a huge fan of seeing m ovies and shows that I love
use AI just to cut around corners. I don't want to go into the m ovies and the first thing I see at the beginning of the m ovie is an AI
generated im age. To m e, that tells m e that whoever m ade the m ovie doesn't care how its m ade, all they want is m oney and that ruins m y
m ovie experience. Yes, you probably have seen the m ultiple "hype" around AI regarding people online or even com panies using it such as
Marvel/Disney. Though this just m akes a m ore worse product that was just m ade in a rush and wanted a quick buck.
