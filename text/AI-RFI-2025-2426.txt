General Comment
This m ust not pass, as it will lead nefarious and untrustworthy actors being able to legally steal US copyrighted m aterial from  im portant
rightsholders. Many of these US copyrighted m aterials are used to protect national security. Pivotal historical endeavors in Hollywood will
be violated as a result of this if it passes, and the value of them  will drop like a rock as the profitability of rereleasing them  or revisiting
them  vanishes. Millions of corporations across Am erica will be devasted and lose the ability to obtain profit. It will also lead to the US
being a weaker power in AI, as US m odels will be less capable of generating new original designs and content due to pollution from
copywritten m aterial that would be usable by the generated result. If this passes, it will lead to the US corporations and citizens being
harm ed m ore than helped.
