General Comment
Regarding Published Docum ent: 2025-02305 (90 FR 9088)
I am  Shocked, appalled, and livid that the United States would consider rem oving copyright protections for enabling the use of AI. This
does not give the United States any advantage. This does not give the United States any opportunities. All it would do is to com pletely
underm ine the jobs and careers of people working in the United States who rely on copyright to both be recognized and com pensated for
the works they produce. This will de-incentivize anyone from  entering those fields. And the great Am erican exports of culture, of m usic
and m ovies and television will cease to be. Because no one will be willing to create works that could be im m ediately "recreated" with
artificial intelligence with no com pensation to the original creator. What would result would be no less than the death of the Am erican
entertainm ent industry in all its shapes and form s. I urge that this m easure not be taken to preserve our country's cultural heritage and
dom inance.
Good day to you.
