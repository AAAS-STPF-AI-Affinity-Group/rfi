General Comment
Generative AI program s are built and “trained” on theft of copyright protected works. In all cases, these program s do little m ore than steal
art and the likenesses of hum ans, m ash them  together, and spit out som e poorly executed slop. In healthcare cases, 66% of diagnoses
were incorrect or m issed crucial inform ation. For scientific research, there has been a great use of AI and m achine learning to develop
vaccines and cures to diseases, but this adm inistration seem s hellbent on destroying any and all progress towards the actual betterm ent of
hum anity in favor of wealth concentration for only the extrem ely rich. In short, i think very few uses of AI technology are even legal, let
alone im portant to foster, and the ones that are, that could actually help our species, are the kinds of things this disgusting, fascist regim e
rejects outright because it could be good. End this absurd chase for generative AI dom inance. This technology is being rejected by the
m asses. Apple is losing m oney because of it. OpenAI is under threat of bankruptcy due to their reliance on theft. This is a losing fad.
