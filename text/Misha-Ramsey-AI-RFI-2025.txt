I realize that I'm past the deadline for submission but I only found out about this call for
information today.
In short, I do not want OpenAI or any other artificial intelligence company to have access to
any of my communications or data. I don't want it in my life. I'm tired of seeing people,companies, and even the American government flog this thing like it's the second coming or areplacement for human intelligence when it's really nothing more than pattern recognitionsoftware.
I want the previous administration's laws and regulations regarding AI to stay in place. Thank
you.
