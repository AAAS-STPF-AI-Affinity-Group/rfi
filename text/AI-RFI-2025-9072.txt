General Comment
I am  a working graphic designer and illustrator, generative AI is increasingly harm ing m y client base, the trust audiences have in artists and
decreasing the perceived value of the work I create.
All AI tools are built on stolen work and AI has already trained on m y copyrighted work which I have NOT granted it perm ission to use.
Those of us in the creative field have no recourse against these com panies who are scraping the entire internet while also showing blatant
disregard for copyright, professional integrity or a single care for how they are destroying whole industries. 
AI m ust be barred from  using copyrighted m aterial, full stop.
