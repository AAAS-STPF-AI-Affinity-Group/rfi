General Comment
As an artist and a writer, I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States. 
No one can deny that AI steals from  the livelihoods of Am ericans and profits off of theft
AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. Consum ers have rejected AI at every turn and yet com panies have
forced the technology into every product im aginable. 
Consum ers do not want this. It is bloatware at best, but from  m y experience, it is so m uch worse.
The only people that want AI are the people who intend to use it to exploit others.
