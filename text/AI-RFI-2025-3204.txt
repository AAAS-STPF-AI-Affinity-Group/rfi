General Comment
Generative AI currently is theft of artists and photographers. Most of which are sm all and donâ€™t have the m illions to defend them selves like
m ega corporations like Google, X, and OpenAI. The artists and photographers that were trained on should have a say in how their
artwork is used. If that is ignored then copyright is nothing m ore than a way for m ega corporations to protect them selves while ruining the
lives of the average Am erican artists. Artists that spent years developing their skills. Please help m ake laws that protect the lives of the
average person that does not have m illions to protect them selves. They rely on the governm ent to m ake ethical choices. 
Thank you.
