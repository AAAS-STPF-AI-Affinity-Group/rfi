General Comment
I hate AI. I don't want it in Am erica. It does not hold a place in the future of the USA. It steals from  m y LIVELIHOOD as an
AMERICAN and profits off of THEFT. Stealing an AMERICAN'S WORK to create SLOP, FILTH, that actively PULLS DOWN at
the Am erican standard of all that is 'good'. It is overhyped and is fleecing the Am erican public. It is a speculative m arket that costs far
m ore than it is worth it to produce filth that doesn't even work the m ajority of the tim e. It is full of false prom ises to fool the public-
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES INCLUDED- and there are Huge problem s by enabling them . No one will respect any so-called 'Art'
com ing out of the US if we allow this regurgitation of Filth to becom e a so-called 'Product'.
