General Comment
I strongly oppose the codification of AI training as fair use. It breaks every litm us test of the fair use standard: it is not transform ative since
AI-created work is ineligible for copyright in of itself; it uses com m ercial, fictional works; it utilizes the entire copyrighted work for the use
of training, it is an explicitly com m ercial use with an im m ense potential for m arket distortion.
AI is a system  designed to take the work of artists, writers, and creatives--the very people that copyright law was created to protect--and
to directly com pete against them . Already, AI-generated slop has threatened countless websites, and Gem ini has turned Google from
m any websites' biggest source of revenue via increased web traffic into its biggest com petitor.
Som e m ay express concern about "losing" the AI "race" to China, but the reality is that these AI tools are far, far m ore lim ited than what
we have been prom ised. Most of their use cases are inferior duplicates of what we already pay hum ans to do, and these AI m odels are far
m ore expensive than a com parable hum an--for reference, see OpenAI charging $20,000 per *m onth* for its new "PhD-level" AI, when
m ost freshm an PhD researchers m ake half that.
Large language m odels are a dead end. They are a cheap trick pushed by charlatans and do not deserve any special protections, and the
world will be better off once they are gone.
