General Comment
I am  strictly against this request for the Biden Adm inistration's restrictions on the AI industry to be lifted. Not only does this undo a great
step towards properly regulating Generative AI, it also rem oves the ability for Artists and other copyright holders to sue OpenAI and any
other Generative AI com pany who takes advantage of this of copyright infringem ent, creating a terrible precedent for artistic works in the
future. If this goes into effect, art as a whole in Am erica will be gutted in favor for Generated Slop which uses stolen works to fuel its own
'creativity'.
In short, we need restrictions on these Generative AI com panies and m odels before they go out of hand and kill hum an expression
outright.
