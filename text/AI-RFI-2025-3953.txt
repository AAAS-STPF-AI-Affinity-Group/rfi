General Comment
AI should not be allowed to train indiscrim inately on copyrighted or sensitive m aterial. Allowing such an act will encourage com panies to
replace people with com puters and further contribute to a brain drain of Am erican creatives, engineers, and other digital workers to other
countries. This will reduce Am erican profit and potential.
AI com panies need to be responsible for the data that they train on and should not be shielded from  legal or financial consequences if they
harm  another's livelihood, leak personal data, or otherwise cause harm  to the Am erican public.
The end result does not justify the m eans here.
