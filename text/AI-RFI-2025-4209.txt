General Comment
AI has been alm ost nothing but a scourge on the m odern internet. It's som ething the vast m ajority of people never asked for, but it's
corportations that push this garbage into every application im aginable, whether it is useful or not. It m akes it harder to find the things you
are looking for without AI slop taking up space. In addition, generative AI m odels are a very real threat to any sort of creative types, not
only to their ability to m ake a living, but also the dilution of artwork into a generic, hom oginized slop, with no room  for vision, intent, style,
etc. There's valid uses for AI out there, sure, but it needs m ore regulation, not less, if we want a m ore positive society. It's not about being
the leading power in every econom ic aspect. There's just m ore to a worthwhile existance than that.
