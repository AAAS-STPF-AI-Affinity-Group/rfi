General Comment
Hello,
I believe AI will only cause m ore issues with the struggles of the creative fields. There are already attacks causing them  to live with lower
and lower wages. If AI isn't stopped or heavy regulated it will cause distrust of all institutions. There will be porn of every one that has a
taken a picture and posted it online. We have seen m any cases that have caused suicides of individuals, som e of the are children.
