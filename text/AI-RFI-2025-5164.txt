General Comment
I am  very against this. AI is a threat to public security and continually gives false inform ation as fact. I would not give consent for any
com pany to access m y work for AI. Reliance on AI has been shown to be a detrim ent to childrenâ€™s ability to use reason and problem
solving skills. This will not help build a better future for them .
