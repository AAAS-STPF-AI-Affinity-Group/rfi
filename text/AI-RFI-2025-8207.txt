General Comment
As a creator, having sole control of m y copyright is the only way to ensure that only I can m ake m oney from  m y creations. I do not
consent to waive m y rights, and I do not consent to the US taking those rights from  m e for m y work. If OpenAI (or any other AI
com pany) cannot m ake m oney without taking other people's intellectual property, it should find another business m odel. Making theft legal
for them  is the opposite of the Am erican Dream .
