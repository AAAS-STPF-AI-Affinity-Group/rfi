General Comment
I am  a public school English teacher, m y husband, a Presbyterian pastor, m y adult children, actors and voice over actors. All of us have
struggles with AI in different ways. My children , and m y son-in-law, also a Voice-over actor have enorm ous concerns about illegal use of
their skill sets and physicality by AI. It can dram attically negatively im pact their control of their voices and their physical selves, and
therefore their ability to earn a living with sam e.
