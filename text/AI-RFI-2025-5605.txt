General Comment
I'm  a freelance artist. My sole incom e is from  m y creativity. I'm  fortunate that I have clients who are willing to buy m y work. But if I have
any aspirations to higher endeavors, that's now nearly im possible because of the num ber of creatives who have been severed from  their
jobs due to the proliferation of generative AI.
So m any of m y acquaintances, people who have never had any trouble getting work based on their bodies of work, have been
unem ployed for m onths or years because the com panies pushing for wholesale thievery have replaced them  with m achines that do nothing
but regurgitate garbage, fed by hum an ideas.
You cannot let these people continue to gut the heart and soul of our culture. They will take everything that is good and unique about the
things that artists create, and they will grind it into unrecognizable ham burger. Rotting, hom ogenized, and braindead. And an entire class of
people will have any sense of stability they have taken away.
You already hate the hom eless, so why are you trying so hard to m ake m ore?
