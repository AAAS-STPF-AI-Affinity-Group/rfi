General Comment
Allowing AI com panies to scrape copyrighted inform ation will have devastating econom ic consequences on artists, as well as the barbers,
landscapers, electricians, plum bers, and other laborers financially supported by those artists. I'm  also concerned for the property taxes
and incom e taxes paid by those artists... those taxes fund schools, firefighters, road m aintenance, etc.
There will be a ripple effect if AI com panies are allowed to rip off artists without com pensating them .
