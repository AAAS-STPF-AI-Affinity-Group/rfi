Overview  
Raptive, a company dedicated to empowering over 5,200 of the largest and most influential 
independent content creators in the United States, wishes to bring to your attention an urgent 
matter that presents both a challenge and an opportunity for OSTP. The rapid advancement of 
generative AI technology poses significant risks to over 100,000 independent content creators —
small business owners who embody the entrepreneurial spirit of our nation.  
These creators rely on open access to digital audiences for their  livelihoods, and the shift toward 
AI-driven content delivery threatens to disrupt their revenue streams, dilute intellectual property 
rights, and undermine the open web. In our response, we detail the challenges faced by these 
vital contributors to Americ a’s digital economy and present targeted policy recommendations to 
ensure that AI innovation continues to flourish without compromising the interests of small 
business owners and independent voices.  
This is a pivotal moment to address these challenges and ensure that independent content 
creators—who play a vital role in the digital economy —are not left behind. Thoughtful policy 
action can help protect small businesses, promote fair competition, and en sure that technological 
innovation continues to flourish without undermining the livelihoods of hardworking Americans.  
The Opportunity for the Office of Science and Technology Policy  


2 OSTP is uniquely positioned to champion the cause of independent content creators. By standing 
up against monopolistic practices and ensuring fair competition, you can reinforce America's 
leadership in innovation while safeguarding the rights of small busi ness owners.  
Key Concerns and Benefits to the OSTP  
1. Protecting Small Businesses from Tech Monopolies  
○ Issue Explanation:  Tech giants like Google are leveraging AI to consolidate 
control over content distribution. Their AI Overviews transform search results 
into comprehensive answers that keep users within their ecosystem, bypassing 
independent creators' websites.  
○ Impact on Creators:  This practice undermines the revenue streams of small 
business owners who rely on website traffic, threatening their livelihoods.  
○ Benefit to the OSTP:  By addressing these monopolistic practices, OSTP can 
protect small businesses, demonstrating your unwavering commitment to fair 
competition and the free market —principles that resonate deeply with the 
American people.  
 


3 Google already controls an overwhelming amount of online search. With no realistic 
alternatives, excluding yourself from Google’s search index, AI training, or AI overviews is a 
death sentence for small independent content creators who rely on Google searc h for about half 
of the traffic that is sent to their site.  
2.Ensuring Ethical Use of AI in Search Engines
○Issue Explanation:  AI-generated summaries in search results provide
information without directing users to the original content sources, diminishing
creators' control over their work and potentially misrepresenting it.
○Impact on Creators:  Reduced traffic and engagement undermine their ability to
monetize content and maintain their businesses.
○Benefit to the OSTP:  Addressing this concern showcases your dedication to
ethical technology use and supports the rights of content creators, reinforcing
America's moral leadership on the global stage.


4  
Traditional Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) simply provided a list of links to choose from, 
directing valuable traffic to the open web.  


5  
Google’s AI Overviews provides attribution, but largely summarizes webpage content, diverting 
valuable traffic away from the websites whose content they are utilizing. Other AI tools like 
ChatGPT only provide attribution if they search the web, which they don’t always do in order to 
provide an answer.  
3. Preventing the Decline of the Open Web  
○ Issue Explanation:  The shift towards AI Overviews and the reduction of support 
for open web technologies threaten the open internet, a cornerstone of free speech 
and innovation.  
○ Impact on Creators:  Independent creators face increased challenges in 
distribution and monetization, jeopardizing their contributions to our digital 
landscape.  
○ Benefit to the OSTP:  By promoting a free and open internet, the OSTP can 
uphold the values of free speech and competition, ensuring that America's digital 
economy remains vibrant and powerful.  


6  
New AI powered search engine features will lead to a degradation of traffic to web pages as 
LLMs become better at providing answers directly on the search page.  
4. Upholding Intellectual Property and Revenue Protections  
○ Issue Explanation:  Without proper safeguards, creators' intellectual property can 
be used by AI tools without consent or compensation, undermining their rights.  
○ Impact on Creators:  This exploitation threatens the economic models that 
support creativity and entrepreneurship.  
○ Benefit to the OSTP:  Protecting intellectual property rights aligns with your 
commitment to the rule of law and supports the economic interests of small 
businesses across the nation.  
 


7 Creators across the country rely on revenue from their site as their sole source or a supplement 
for their income. To date Raptive creators have generated billions of dollars in revenue.  
The OSTP is Perfectly Positioned to Address this Issue  
The OSTP’s steadfast support for small businesses and track record of challenging unfair 
practices uniquely position it to tackle this problem effectively. OSTP’s leadership can ensure 
that American innovation thrives while safeguarding the rights and live lihoods of independent 
creators. By taking decisive action, you reinforce America's commitment to fairness, 
competition, and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives our nation forward.
