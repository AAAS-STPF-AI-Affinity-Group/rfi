To whom it may concern,  
And if concerns everyone. If AI is allowed to continue unchecked, and copyright laws are
allowed to disappear, they world is going to become so very dull. The servers it takes to usegenerative AI are extremely damaging to the environment. Any creative endeavor will alsoeither and die, since very few true creative will be willing to continue sharing their work andideas with the world. All AI will end up looking and sounding exactly the same, as they'regoing to end up training on the same limited materials over and over again.
 
AI needs limitations. Please consider the future for your children.
