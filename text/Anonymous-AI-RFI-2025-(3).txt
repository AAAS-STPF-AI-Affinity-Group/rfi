In my view the U.S. should build massive AI data centers for AI companies, These can be owned 
by the U.S. Government and leased to AI companies for a fee. This way the U.S. can recoup 
some or possible all of its cost. (potentially profiting from this and p utting this money into a 
National sovereign wealth fund for the U.S.) AI Companies can help design these data centers to 
fit their needs in coordination with the Federal Government this would mean AI companies could 
spend less capital on building Data Cent ers and Power stations in the short term and focus and 
developing the actual AI. This would not only help the U.S. remain in the lead but would likely 
attract foreign investment into AI as well in the U.S. depending on the size of the investment for 
example 1-2 trillion over four years, it would be highly unlikely for China to catch up. 
controlling the servers would also make it easier for the U.S. to shut down rouge AI agents. my 
opinion is that the power stations powering the data centers should not be ab le to be controlled 
by an AI. It, would be better to shut down a rouge AI by going after the power center not the data 
servers. A few reasons for this is that, 1. its easier to go after the power stations instead of a data 
center is that the power station is smaller. 2.going after the power station instead of the data 
center is cheaper for rebuilding. 3. going after the power station means the data in the data 
servers is preserved and the government can go through the data to see what went wrong to 
prevent it from happening again.
