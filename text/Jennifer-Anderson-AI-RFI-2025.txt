The issue of A.I. is inherently linked to our system of intellectual property laws, which have 
been in dire need of a rehaul for decades, particularly since the passage of the Sonny Bono 
Copyright Act in 1998. Intellectual property laws that are too restri ctive interfere with the 
creative process and freedom of speech. Professor Lawrence Lessig (also an attorney and one -
time presidential candidate) has been working on this issue for at least two decades. It is 
impossible to build a proper, workable policy o n Artificial Intelligence without addressing 
Intellectual Property laws. I highly recommend that you contact him, or at the very least do some 
reading on this. I am happy to point you towards resources if you'd like.
