General Comment
Innovation at the cost of people is always going to be a net negative. Do not go forward with this plan. The only people who will benefit
are the people who do not care about m aking lives better. Quality of work will be worse. AI is already easy to fool and exorbitantly
expensive. Pushing it into m ore situations, m ore places, will not help anyone in the short term  or the long term .
Again, do not go forward with this plan.
