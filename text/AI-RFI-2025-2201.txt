General Comment
We do not want AI to run our governm ent. It is a fine technology and like all useful tech it will grow and evolve in spite of efforts to
regulate it. However, that does not m ean we should sim ply rem ove all roadblocks and checkpoints. We are a nation n for the people, by
the people. Nowhere there does it say that we should offload decision-m aking, m anual review, and listening directly to the people onto
unfinished language m odels and generative AI.
This solution is lazy, m alicious, and undeserved by the Am erican people. Our leaders should be asham ed but they've already proven
incapable of that.
