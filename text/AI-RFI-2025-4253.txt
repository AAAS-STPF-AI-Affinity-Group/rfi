General Comment
I am  a disabled artist and draw with a pen in m y m outh. Allowing AI to take m y hard work - the thing I m ake m y living with - and use it to
churn out stuff sim ilar to m ine without any com pensation is theft. You are asking to legally steal the fruits of m y labor. This is exactly WHY
we have copyright and IP law. Do not do this.
