General Comment
Com panies need to be held liable for any harm  their AI does. Generative AI also needs to be thoroughly regulated, it shouldn't be trained
on any stolen content, I worry that there'll be bad actors that use video/im age generation to spread harm ful m isinform ation (especially for
political reasons), and advertisem ents m ade using AI m ight falsely represent the products/services (I've already seen AI generated ads for
AI chat m obile apps suggesting you can date underage copyrighted characters). I don't want AI everywhere, I really don't want to see AI
used for anything creative, I have no power to stop that, but if it's going to happen, at least put som e effort into regulating it. Ideally we'd
also get m ore data protection, cause we barely even have any of that as a country, but that'd be against com panies like X's best interests,
so I have no faith that'd happen, despite it probably having bipartisan support, especially am ongst working class conservatives.
