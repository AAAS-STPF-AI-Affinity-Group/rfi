As a small business owner, I love AI. It has the potential to help us automate much of our 
work flow and is integral to keeping America competitive in global marketing. Our business is 
publishing. We employ 22 hardworking Americans and produce hundreds of original works per month. These articles are not written with AI, but we use the technology to help us copy-edit and brainstorm. It is fantastic and amazing in so many ways. We want America to promote and develop AI and firmly support efforts to make us a world leader. We have only two asks: 1) That copyright law is built into the process and respected. Napster almost killed the music industry. The courts correctly ruled that stealing music was forbidden. Then, technologies were developed to measure music st reaming, and an entire new industry was born. Things didn't go back to the 
"old ways," but they morphed into something different - and as a result, the music industry exists today. We ask for the same licensing system for AI LLMs using our content - and this must include ALL publishers and not just big media companies. 2) That the power and might of the United States is used to protect our intellectual property rights worldwide. Big tech companies or foreign governments should not ingest our content, censor output, control the narrative, and profit from our work. Any company or country shown to engage in anything other than transparent, free, and compensated use of content should be subject to the harshest penalties. To steal from U.S. citizens and rights -holders should be an act of war. We are at a critical juncture 
with a fascinating and powerful new technology. Now is the time to make the right choices to both keep America a leader in AI development and sustain content creation in a long- term 
manner. After all, without content, AI stagnates and fails. Plus, it is just the right thing to do. Thank you for your consideration.
