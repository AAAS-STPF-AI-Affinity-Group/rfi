General Comment
AI is overhyped to an extrem e and big tech com panies are trying to m ake good on a faulty investm ent with a product that does not benefit
the Am erican public. It relies on theft of copyright and intellectual property to train its system s, and spits out content that at best serves the
sam e purpose as Google, and at worst can be wildly factually incorrect. Additionally, beyond the theft of content to build the system s, AI
actively takes jobs from  Am erican workers, in both creative and non-creative fields. Investm ent in AI will bankrupt the Am erican public
intellectually, econom ically, and ethically. AI should not be endorsed or bolstered by US laws and lawm akers.
