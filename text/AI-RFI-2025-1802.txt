General Comment
What is being sold as "artificial intelligence" is nothing but a shell gam e. It's a prediction software solution looking for a problem
retroactively. The way it has been used is to lie, cheat, steal, and m anufacture garbage. The only way it can exist is by taking copy written
m aterial to train on. This m eans it's also a ethically terrible. Its output is illogical at best and dangerous at worst.
As a teacher, I see students trying to use it to cheat every day. Because of the technology's shortcom ings, I usually catch them . However,
the dam age is done. The students stop thinking and let the m achine think for them .
I've seen entirely invented journal articles that reference hallucinated concepts. Then I've seen researchers cite that entirely false
inform ation like it was real. This has the possibility to cripple our scientific com m unity through the sheer volum e of m ade up slop.
Lastly, beyond the social and ethical issues, our nation's power infrastructure can't handle the dem and Silicon Valley is dem anding. That
infrastructure can't handle our nation's growing needs now from  years of neglect as is. 
For all these reasons, I believe the US should enforce copyright laws it has now. I think rules about AI should be created lim iting its
training data usage. Com panies illegally training AI should be required to backpay the citizens they stole from .
