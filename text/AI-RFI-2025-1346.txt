General Comment
The analysis of data for the betterm ent of hum an experience is a worthwhile endeavor, however the m ajority of AI developm ent in the
m odern day is a boondoggle scam  of throwing m oney at the sam e people who inflated the idea of Cryptocurrency changing the world and
did nothing but defraud thousands. 
A breathtaking waste of resources for a theoretical benefit that has not been proven; water, power, and the land & resources to build data
centers are a waste in a nation that needs housing and healthcare NOW m ore than they need funny program s on their phone or the
prom ise of a benevolent AI god from  a cult of billionaire sycophants.
This idea of expending so m uch in service of AI is also laughable, in a nation whose leadership is killing the CHIPS act, our biggest
investm ent in dom estic m icrochip m anufacturing. Where are we getting the chips to build all the data centers from  for this AI revolution,
Elon? 
Our president is cutting our nation's wrists, and if we go down the path of throwing m oney at Artificial Intelligence then soon we will be
begging China for the technological hardware to chase the pipe dream , desperately spending billions or trillions into the pockets of
adversarial nations who will welcom e a stranglehold over our ability to innovate the future of our dom estic technology and m anufacturing
capability.
The legal ram ifications are also a m ounting issue of wasted m oney in court, AI currently defrauds thousands of artists and innovators by
using their works without right or com pensation and having the federal governm ent take on that legal burden is just m aking the taxpayer
take on the legal costs of thieving billionaires yet again.
