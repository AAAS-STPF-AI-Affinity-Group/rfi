General Comment
Open Ai (and all other generative AI technology) cannot exist without theft of Intellectual property. If people want to train AI using their
own work then so be it, but Open Ai (and all other generative ai technology today) currently train their m odels based on the work of other
hum an beings without their perm ission. While I fully support the furthering of technology and growth as a society m oving towards the
future, I do not believe giving these people a pass on crim e against other hum ans is a good idea. Our copyright laws are pretty clear and
have been protected for ages for a reason. Please do not let these m oney hungry m en steal from  and starve m ore artists.
