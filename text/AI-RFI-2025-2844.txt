General Comment
We need copyright protection laws, and any agreem ent to let AI train on stolen content will only destroy our creative industry. Creatives
will not only no longer find good paying jobs, but a m ass disillusionm ent in the field will destroy it far into the future, creating a world
where Am erica will only ever regurgitate the sam e artistic ideas, stagnate, and lose any position at the forefront of cultural developm ent.
The im portance of art - from  graphic design to m usic to m ovies to video gam es to com ics - will wither in the face of a regim e that sells out
its people for a handful of com pany interests. This m ove will m ake Am erica fall behind the world yet again in another industry, and be
disregarded in this topic while flourishing arts elsewhere in the world thrive. Countless skills and arts will be lost here. 
The very idea that the legislative branch is entertaining the idea of allowing it is the snake swallowing its own tail. Do it, and the snake will
consum e itself and perish.
I hope federal regulators will uphold the laws already stated, protect copyright from  m ass theft, and deny AI the rights to others' skills,
labor and creations.
