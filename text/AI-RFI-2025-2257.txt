General Comment
AI needs to be seriously regulated so that it cannot use otherâ€™s inform ation without consent. Giving AI com panies free rein to use
whatever inform ation or data they want without restriction endangers us all. In an age where our data is so easily obtained and abused by
those in power and other scam m ers, I do not want to see m y data, m y intellectual property, m y art, or anything associated with m e be put
up for grabs for anyone who wants it, to do whatever they want with it. I feel that it violates m y rights to privacy and it violates m y rights to
ownership over m y own inform ation and property like m y photos and m y art.
