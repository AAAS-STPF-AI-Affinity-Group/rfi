General Comment
AI com panies need to respect the copyright of m aterial they use. It's theft for them  to take artists work without licensing agreem ents.
Many popular artists have their pieces copied so m any tim es that the AI tries to rem ake their signatures. There are plenty of ways for AI
com panies to get legal data, let them  actual pay artists for what they use.
The entire AI industry is bubble with scam  artists desperately looking for governm ent handouts to bail out their reckless investm ents. Why
are we giving handouts to these com panies? Let the free m arket decide their fate.
