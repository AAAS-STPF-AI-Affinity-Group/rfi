I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the United States of America. The power and
capabilities of AI have been overhyped, oversold, and are causing much more harm than goodin terms
 of people's livelihoods as well as the environment due to its extensive energy usage.
AI also profits off of the theft of others' work. These AI models have been trained on anextremely large amount of copyrighted works without the permission of their creators. This inand of itself is a major issue but on top of that, these AI companies profit off of these stolenworks. For these reasons, such practices should be considered illegal.
AI has not and will not benefit the
 American public in any meaningful way and it is largely
seen as fleeting technology. If anything, it is a completely unnecessary risk to the security,
safety, and well-being of the American people.
