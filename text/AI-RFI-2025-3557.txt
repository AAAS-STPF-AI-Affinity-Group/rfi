General Comment
I am  a novelist and poet with three published books. I can't im agine in a m illion years why we would allow AI to train on copyrighted
works produced by hum ans. Whom  does this benefit rather than the AI com panies and their billionaire owners? Artists deserve to keep
the rights to their own work, and we are not consenting for them  to be used in this way. This doesn't benefit hum anity as a whole.
