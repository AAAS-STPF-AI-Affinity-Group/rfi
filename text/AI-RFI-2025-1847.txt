General Comment
I am  strongly against the governm ent's affiliation and prom otion of AI. AI hurts sm all businesses, displaces workers, produces m ediocre
content, and violates copyright by using copyrighted m aterial in its data bank. Furtherm ore, Google has used AI as a tool for censorship.
The governm ent should not use AI as an excuse to funnel m ore funding into the tech sector.
