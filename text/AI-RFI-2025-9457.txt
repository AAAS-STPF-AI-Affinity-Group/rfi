General Comment
I believe m y hard work that I have worked on as an Am erican artist should’ve not be used without proper com pensation. There’s nothing
free use or transform ative. The software is glorified tracing our work which is protected under copyright which was created to protect the
Am erican dream . They couldn’t go through proper channels to get perm ission and trained off data from  com panies and even low incom e
artist. If the Am erican dream  can’t even protect m y hard work and dedication how do I know that they even have any dedication to
Am erica and the Am erican dream  as a whole. The pursuit for happiness is being challenged m ore and m ore. By letting copyright laws be
ignored will further destroy business and independent artist just trying to m ake a living.
