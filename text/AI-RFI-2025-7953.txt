General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US because it steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican, and profits off of theft.
It's clear AI is overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public, we need m ore forward thinking, creative people producing art
and content, and not soulless m achines.
