General Comment
Professional artist AND writer here.
I have seen m y nam e on a list of screenwriters whose work was STOLEN by AI engines that com pensate neither m e, as a copyright
holder, nor the copyright holders of work I did for hire. The resulting training is being used to PUT ME OUT OF A JOB.
Worse... the results of this theft generate a product that is universally seen as inferior to the work of actual writers and artists. Though
there is SHORT TERM value in cost cutting for the users of AI, the long term  dam age, both to those sam e users AND the victim s of AI,
are huge. Audiences (consum ers) will NOT shell out their m oney for a product that is both dem onstrably WORSE than what they're used
to AND costs the m akers less to m ake, or nothing at all.
This is a ponzi schem e and pum p-and-dum p scam  being perpetrated by a few greedy tech-bros.
AI is NOT inevitable... but its failure to live up to the prom ise IS inevitable... and its unethical nature is BEYOND QUESTION.
Step away. Recom m end against. Do not allow this scourge to destroy so m any lives.
