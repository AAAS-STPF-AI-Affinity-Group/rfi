General Comment
Generative AI is a trap. It is neither artificial, nor intelligent. It is nothing m ore than a glorified chatbot that can kind of, sort of, if you're not
looking too close, piece together word salad in a way that m akes sense, but the results are rarely accurate and never good. The AI of
tom orrow cannot possibly be m easurably better than the AI of today, because it's already been trained on all of hum an knowledge. The
only thing left to train it on is its own garbage data, which will only m ake it worse.
It is astronom ically expensive to run, and the resources it consum es are needlessly dam aging the planet in the process. The m ost advanced
AI m odel that exists costs BILLIONS of dollars m ore than the revenue it generates. It has no practical use cases, even after 2+ years of
developm ent and billions of wasted venture capitalist m oney. The AI tech bubble will, inevitably, burst, and saddling the US governm ent
with that debt will only send us spiraling faster into another recession, if not another Great Depression.
An intelligently run governm ent would regulate this technology to prevent the harm  its m isuse could bring through deliberate disinform ation.
An intelligently run governm ent would let Silicon Valley waste its own m oney, rather than propping up an obviously failing industry as it
doubles down on useless "innovation." Do better.
