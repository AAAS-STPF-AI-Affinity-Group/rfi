1. AI techniques must be evaluated for security before implementing and evaluated for accuracy and quality before
any persons job is changed2. AI should help the federal workforce do their jobs, not replace the workforce! AI has a tendency to hallucinate, behacked, be plain wrong - there must be enough people to check and correct AI for the sake of our citizens and duties.3. Get Elon Musks greedy unelected unethical hands off everything and anything in our government this is supposedto be a democracy not an oligarchy4. Congress must vote and pass anything proposed- the president needs to stop swindling us with worthless andillegal executive actions
