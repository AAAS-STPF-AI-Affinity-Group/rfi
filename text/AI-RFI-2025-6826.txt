General Comment
No AI com pany has the legal (or m oral) right to sim ply take a person's copyrighted work and redistribute it for their own financial gain.
There is no precedent for this level of labor theft, and no benefit to the econom y by handing over the rights of other people's works to
large corporations that already have m assive am ounts of m oney. If a corporation needs work, then they pay for it, that's how businesses
operate. It's absolutely incredible to m e that whether or not these m assive projects fail is of any concern to the US governm ent. They are
illegal, m ake no pretext of being legal, offer no benefit to society and are in fact parasitic in nature, taking the hard work and resources of
actual productive m em bers of society who work tirelessly to inform , entertain and better our country and grind it up into m ush to resell to
the highest bidder. These tools are being used to m ake the internet basically unusable, and everyone hates them . Furtherm ore, once the
boom  is done the entire AI industry is going to crash and burn, creating additional dam age to the econom y.
