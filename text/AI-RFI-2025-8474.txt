General Comment
Giving AI especially one com pany unlim ited access to copyritten m aterial would stifle Am erican innovation and creativity as well as put a
dam per on free speech. Am erica is great because of com petition and the idea that anyone can write the next great Am erican novel, be the
next Spielberg, the next Springsteen, and that their hard work and efforts deserve to m ake them  m oney and for everyone to control what
has access to their speech. The governm ent shouldn't be picking winners and losers in this space as it's still new. Thank you for your tim e.
