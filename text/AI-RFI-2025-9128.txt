General Comment
Good grief, are you kidding? You're seriously of the belief that AI, as system  that has been proven to worsen critical thinking skills thanks
to Microsoft's recent study, as well as not even be reliable in the first place with it being wrong 60% of the tim e on Google alone, is the
way of the future? THAT'S em barrassing. This crap system  is som ehow even m ore m ediocre than NFTs were, actively has led to court
cases as a result of deepfake pornography issues, and been caught blatently stealing from  others' created works.
AI is a garbage excuse for an assistant for any kind of info available and can be m anipulated to do things it's not supposed to do without
m uch effort, breaking any rules you could possibly set for it to turn it against you, m aking you look even dum ber than you already are by
using it. This is what an idiot's idea of a brilliant program  is. Are you willing to be ridiculed even further by supporting AI? Surely you want
to save face after everything that's happened with Elon Musk already, I m ean really. Don't stoop to this level. You can do so m uch better
than this. I don't approve of this and neither should you or anyone else.
