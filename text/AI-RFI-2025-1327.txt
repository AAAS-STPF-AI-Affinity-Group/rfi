General Comment
My nam e is Ben Hebor and I am  a m em ber of the graduating class of 2025 at Avonworth High School. I have com pleted a sem ester
course on AI and Ethics and studied the im pact of Generative AI on Politics. Executive Order 14179 will have a m ixed result on AI In
Am erican Politics. Through m y research of AI effects on politics I have discovered the ins and outs of how political cam paigns use
generative AI to get elected. The m ain use of AI in politics is to create advertising. Advertising using generative AI has been found to be
extrem ely effective in our m odern world, which can cause m isleading inform ation and ideas that can be spread like a wildfire. This is
especially m agnified in the older generations who are not as fam iliar with AI and what is real. I would like to see the Federal governm ent
m ove in a way to restrict the use of AI in a political fashion. Num erous laws sim ilar to what I suggest exist on the state level from  Florida
to California. This could prove to be a beneficial step in the realm  of AI to “solidify our position as the global leader in AI and secure a
brighter future for all Am ericans”(E.O. 14179) while keeping Am erican elections fair and free.
