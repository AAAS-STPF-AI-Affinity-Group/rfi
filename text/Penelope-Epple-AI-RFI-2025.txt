Hello,
The current unregulated nature of generative AI is harmful to businesses and a competitive market. Without
regulations, generative AI is currently able to train and steal from copyrighted materials, thus hurting and stealingfrom the copyright holders. Without copyright protections, businesses, especially smaller businesses, have a hardertime competing in the market. And even large businesses are affected as it becomes even easier to infringe on theircopyright. Without regulations, generative AI will weaken and possibly destroy all rights and protections tointellectual property, thus hurting and preventing innovation. Please regulate generative AI so that materialsproduced from it must prove they were not trained or draw from datasets that include copyrighted material to protectthe individuals and businesses who own those intellectual properties from theft.
Hope you stay safe and well,
Penelope Epple
