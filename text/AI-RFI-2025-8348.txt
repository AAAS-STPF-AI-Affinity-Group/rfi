General Comment
For the love of God, do not do this. Without proper consent being considered, AI is theft. Artists are incredibly talented and hard
workers in a craft that they hone on their own, and they do not need to be tram pled on from  an unregulated, poorly m isunderstood, and
downright dangerous tool.
