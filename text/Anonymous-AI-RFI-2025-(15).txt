Generative AI is a buzzword cashgrab to give lazy people the ability to steal information, 
writing, voice, music and art from other people instead of using their brain to make it themselves, or pay someone else to. That won't beat China. This will help no one. it'll be a big copyright infringement issue because someone will ai generate an image of mickey mouse and claim it's theirs and disney will sue. How many big companies are going to be okay with their copyrights being infringed? Should a person being able to use AI generation to simulate voices of ceos and politicians and command authority through impersonation? This needs to be kept in check for a stronger america.
