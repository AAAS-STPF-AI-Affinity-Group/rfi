General Comment
Absolutely inexcusable. We can't find the funding to keep libraries open but we want to de-regulate this LLM slop? No. The Am erican
public cannot afford this kind of short sighted nonsense. Any attem pts at rem oving barriers to protect actual authors, designers, artists, etc.
are unacceptable and certainly not to benefit som e tech billionaires. 
Where will the servers com e from ? How will they be m aintained? Where will all the m oney for this com e from ? How is this good for
ANYONE except the people who own " AI "?
