The companies providing AI computation should be required to pay for the many secondary 
costs of this technology, i.e. extreme energy consumption and environmental fallout. The 
consequences of unscrupulous expansion must be accounted for and prevented, whi ch can only 
happen by reigning in heedless actors. There must be extensive work done on responsible use of the technology, including via public education campaigns, in laws preemptively safeguarding Americans from outsourced decision -making left to flawed algorithms. “A computer cannot be 
held accountable; therefore a computer must never make management decisions“ should be a well-known and enforced standard before more lives, industries, and economies are forced to 
suffer for corporate use of AI.
