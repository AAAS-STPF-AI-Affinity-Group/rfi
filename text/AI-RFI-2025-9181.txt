General Comment
The protection that Executive Order 14110 provided the people of the United States was one that had the people's best intentions at
heart. Ultim ately the ones who are responsible for the United States governm ent's existence are the people and its governm ent should be
for the people. It is insulting that our governing powers would so easily revoke protections for our people for a technological arm s race
whose basis relies on foreign nations being entities of evil or directly antagonistic to the United States and it sends a m essage to those
people of those nations that we use them  as an excuse to allow our governm ent to do anything in the nam e of a cold war that m ost
Am ericans will never experience the effects of unless they are directly cause their own governm ent. Crypto has been used alm ost entirely
for scam s and grifts in the recent years even by our own president and should NOT be taken seriously by our governing body. I hope that
there are those in our governm ent who will listen to it's educated citizens and hear past the scream s of its frustrated victim s of the
conservative propaganda m achine and will stand for the people who want a country that serves them  instead of those who seek to abuse
them .
