General Comment
This is a blatant disregard of individual and corporate copyright law in the nam e of enhancing controversial tech that is already volatile in
nature and does not have a future in the future of the United States. The livelihood of Am erican artisans is actively at risk of being poached
by m achines that do not know how to create, only how to generate.
