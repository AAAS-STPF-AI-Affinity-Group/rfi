My name is Anna Bradley, and I am a graduating senior at Avonworth High School. I researched 
the impact of generative AI on nursing in hospitals for a semester course and recently studied 
this administration's viewpoint on AI regulation. Based on my two mo nths of student research I 
think AI should be advanced and utilized in a very cautious manner. The many benefits of using 
AI include, lessened documentation time, helpful resources, rewriting discharge papers, medicine 
prescriptions, and much more. However , I believe it should be a cautious tool instead of 
something relied upon. AI, although not fully developed, will never reach the expectations 
needed when it comes to health and medicine. Researchers have found an immense draw back 
when using AI tools like  ChateGPT in nursing because it cannot adjust to many health issues at 
once. It takes longer routes to solve problems, advises expensive tests when not needed, and 
when put side by side in a competition with nurses, took much longer to find resolutions. I think 
AI can be a beneficial tool when used correctly. Acting as a nurse is not the proper way to 
incorporate it into health care. Instead, being an assistant in the technology aspects of the job. 
Documentation time takes up approximately 26.2 -41% of the w ork hours specifically for nurses 
(Yen, Kellye, et al). Using AI could lower that percentage and allow more patient -nurse 
interactions. I truly believe using AI could open doors for healthcare to advance, however, it 
must be cautiously incorporated and uti lized in the nursing field.
