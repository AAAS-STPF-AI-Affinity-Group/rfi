General Comment
While I have no opposition to further research on artificial general intelligence (AGI), this action plan needs to exclude generative AI from
its scope. Generative AI has shown no potential towards the creation of AGI and only exists as a m ildly interesting auto-com plete function
and im age generation tool, one that is being m arketed to unaware consum ers off of prom ises it can never fulfill. Additionally, the fact that
generative AI is trained off of copyrwritten work without paym ent or attribution m akes it a danger to all aspects of the econom y (artistic
and otherwise). If anything, generative AI needs additional restrictions placed upon it, and m y fear is that if this plan covers it, it will have
adverse effects upon the Am erican econom y and Am erica's role in the developm ent of global-reaching m edia and culture.
