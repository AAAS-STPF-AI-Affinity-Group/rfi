General Comment
There is nothing that national security stands to gain by letting Open AI and google bulldoze any and all art and culture other than m aking
m oney and undercutting even the m ost indirect and inconsequential com petition to their bottom  line. This is not protecting the nation, this is
further securing the wallets of billionaires at the cost of m illions of people who haven't seen m ore than a thousand dollars in one place. The
governm ent is bought out and we get to suffer for it. Worse governm ents have done better.
