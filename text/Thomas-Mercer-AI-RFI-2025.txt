Federal employees who are not terminated/bought out should be redirected to work that advances 
AI development. Whether working on semiconductor production, training AIs, etc. Our tax 
dollars should be put to the best use possible, to ensure we remain the l eaders in AI. Low/mid 
skill workers should be encouraged to automate themselves out of a job, and be 
guaranteed/rewarded new and better jobs.
