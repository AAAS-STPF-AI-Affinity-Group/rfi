General Comment
Creative arts of all stripes (writing, m usic, art, etc) will suffer trem endously if further "innovation " in the field of artificial intelligence
becom es governm ent funded and subsidized.
Creation is a cornerstone of hum an expression and AI will destroy every single creative industry if allowed to flourish. This would cost
hundreds of thousands of Am ericans their jobs and livelihoods and severely dum b down the level of artistic expression in the world. No
other country in the world has as wide ranging and profitable a visual arts industry as Am erica, and that industry was not built off of
algorithm s. It was built by real people that will suffer from  innum erable challenges if their jobs are taken away by AI. 
As a creative hobbyist and taxpayer, I will not pay another dim e in federal taxes if the governm ent chooses to try and subsidize the growth
of Artificial Intelligence. You're already trying your hardest to destroy the IRS too, so I'm  not terribly concerned about being audited.
