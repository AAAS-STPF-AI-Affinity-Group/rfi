Re: Request for Information: Development of an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan (AI 
Action Plan)  
Dear Mr. D'Souza,  
On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights , a coalition charged by 
its diverse membership of more than 240 national organizations to promote and protect the 
civil and human rights of all persons in the United States, and its Center for Civil Rights and 
Technology , we write1 in response to the Request for Information (RFI) on the Development 
of an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan (AI Action Plan).2 We acknowledge both the 
benefits and  the risks  posed by AI , and t o ensure the benefits of AI can be fully realized, it is 
essential for the administration to seek input from all stakeholders to properly address 
concerns in the AI Action Plan.  
This response aligns with the goals outlined in the 2020 executive order (EO) on AI ,3 which 
emphasized the importance of American leadership in AI to enhance economic 
competitiveness and national security while promoting human flourishing and our country’s 
core democratic values. By advocating for robust data privacy regulations, oversight 
mechan isms, and transparency in AI deployment, The Leadership Conference's 
recommendations support that EO’s goals of fostering public trust and ensuring that AI 
technologies are developed and used in a responsible, safe, and effective manner. In addition 
to tho se areas, these comments are responsive to the current RFI’s request for views on 
addressing model development, application and use (either in the private sector or by

government), explainability and assurance of AI model outputs, cybersecurity, data privacy and security 
throughout the lifecycle of AI system development and deployment, risks, regulation and governance, 
technical and safety standards, research and develop ment, education and workforce, innovation and 
competition, and procurement. The AI Action Plan should underscore a commitment to advancing AI in a 
manner that benefits all individuals and upholds fundamental rights and freedoms.  
To achieve AI’s benefits, the AI Action Plan must address AI’s risks.  
With the widespread use of AI, individuals are grappling with the impacts of discriminatory automated 
systems in every facet of life. AI systems have led to the loss of economic opportunities, higher costs or 
denial of loans and credit, wrongful arrests , adverse impact on individuals’ employment or ability to get a 
job, lower quality health  care, and barriers to housing . Others have raised additional areas of concern, 
including national security threats, the ability to compete globally, innovation, and marketplace 
competition. None of the desired outcomes in those areas are achievable if AI systems are not trustworthy 
and if they are not safe, effective, and fair.  
Despite the  well-documented  risks and harms of AI, we lack appropriate safeguards for AI development 
and use, such as data minimization requirements, privacy protections, pre - and post -deployment impact 
assessments, protections against unfair treatment, and accountability measures. Moreover, the “black 
box” nature of many AI systems prevents adequate transparency and accountability, denying impacted 
people the ability to contest  errors when they occur.  
The AI Action Plan should include concrete measures to ensure AI safety and accountability.  
The AI Action Plan should include concrete measures for deploying AI, including impact assessments, 
testing, data minimization, privacy protections, transparency and explainability requirements, and the 
availability of human alternatives, especially where the use of AI results in consequential decisions.   
1. Ensuring Fairness in AI Development and Deployment
AI technologies must be developed and deployed in ways that promote fairness. For example, historical 
biases embedded in data can lead to discriminatory outcomes  that disproportionately affect marginalized 
communities, including people of color, women, immigrants, and individuals with disabilities. AI that 
harms the American people is not moving society forward. We must address these risks and ensure AI 
systems are des igned with robust safeguards. As the administration develops the AI Action Plan, it should  
consider the impact of AI, including calling for identifying and mitigating harm.   
We recommend the following actions:  
●Audits and Impact Assessments:  Mandate regular bias audits and impact assessments for AI
systems, particularly those used in high -stakes areas such as criminal justice, employment, and
health  care, to ensure those systems work and the outcomes are fair for everyone.

●Data Practices:  Encourage the use of diverse and representative datasets in AI training to
minimize bias and ensure equitable outcomes.
●Transparency and Accountability:  Implement transparency requirements for AI systems,
including clear documentation of data sources, algorithms, and decision -making processes.
Establish accountability mechanisms to address and rectify erroneous outcomes.
To be effective, the AI Action Plan must also ensure that where AI is put into use it is accessible to all 
community members. For example, people with disabilities continue to face accessibility challenges in 
using AI systems. Developers need to intentiona lly include disabled people by building systems that 
conform to accessibility standards. Developers should also consider the impact that differences in 
language may have to ensure accessibility for communities where AI systems are used.  
2. Protecting Privacy and Civil Liberties
The deployment of AI technologies must respect individuals' privacy and civil liberties. The potential for 
AI to infringe on privacy rights is significant, particularly in surveillance and data collection practices. 
We urge the following measures:  
●Data Privacy Regulations:  Strengthen data privacy regulations to protect individuals from
unauthorized data collection and use. Ensure that AI systems comply with these regulations.
●Surveillance Oversight:  Establish oversight mechanisms for AI -driven surveillance technologies
to prevent misuse and protect civil liberties.
●Consent and Control:  Ensure that individuals have control over their data and are informed
about how their data are being used by AI systems.
3. Promoting Transparency and Public Engagement
Public trust in AI technologies is essential for their successful adoption. Transparency and public 
engagement are key to building this trust. We recommend:  
●Public Reporting:  Require regular public reporting on the performance, impact, and risks of AI
systems. This includes disclosing any incidents of harmful outcomes.
●Stakeholder Engagement:  Foster ongoing engagement with a diverse range of stakeholders to
ensure that AI policies and practices reflect the needs and concerns of all communities. Engaging
with communities can provide valuable insights to better inform the development and use of AI
systems.
●Education and Awareness:  Invest in public education initiatives to raise awareness about AI
technologies, their benefits, and potential risks.
4. Ensuring Accountability and Redress
Accountability mechanisms are crucial to address harm caused by AI systems. We propose the following 
actions:  


March 1 4, 2025  
Page 4 of 4   
●Regulatory Frameworks:  Develop and enforce regulatory frameworks that hold AI developers
and deployers accountable for the impacts of their technologies.
●Redress Mechanisms:  Establish accessible redress mechanisms for individuals and communities
adversely affected by AI systems. This includes providing avenues for reporting and addressing
grievances.
5. Promoting Economic Growth and Jobs
The AI Action plan should address AI’s potential for economic growth and the creation of good jobs. This 
includes mitigating adverse economic impact and job losses by enhancing labor protections and banning 
certain AI uses or practices that are potentially  harmful or violate worker privacy. By mitigating potential 
job losses, the AI Action Plan can harness technology for the growth of good jobs.   
AI can harm workers by displacing them from their current positions, lower job quality, and increase 
unemployment. The AI Action Plan should ensure that displaced workers have an adequate social safety 
net, including reskilling and retraining opportunities . 
Conclusion  
AI should work, and it should work for everyone. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights 
and its Center for Civil Rights and Technology are  committed to ensuring that AI technologies are 
developed and deployed in ways that advance equity, protect civil liberties, and promote transparency and 
accountability. Those creating and using AI systems have a responsibility to ensure that those systems  
work, are fit for purpose, and are not harmful. AI systems should not be used unless they are shown to be 
trustworthy,  and the AI Action Plan should make clear that AI must be effective, safe, and fair.   
Thank you for considering our recommendations.  If you have any questions, please contact 
Sincerely,  
The Leadership Conf erence ’s Center for Civil Rights and Technology
