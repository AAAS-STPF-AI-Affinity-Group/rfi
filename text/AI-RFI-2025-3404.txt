General Comment
It’s im perative that AI not be im m une to copyright lawsuits. I’m  a US citizen, Alabam a born and raised, and part of m y livelihood is
earned through the art that I m ake with m y own hands. Generative AI specifically is based on and profits from  art theft. It actively steals
from  m y livelihood, steals m y hard work. AI that needs to steal the work of hum an beings, Am erican citizens, is som ething that is nowhere
near as good as people try and claim  it to be. AI generated “inform ation” and sum m aries are alm ost always factually incorrect and is
turning the Am erican public into people who cannot tell truth from  lie and think for them selves. AI has absolutely no place in the future of
the US, especially if it’s allowed to be unregulated to this degree.
