General Comment
Generative AI is, in a word, theft. Generative AI studies and exam ines real artistsâ€™ work and then copies it into a database where it will
use the digital inform ation to create a plethora of false im ages. 
This not only allows people using this AI to steal the art styles and hard work of real artists but also can allow them  to lie and m anipulate
people into believing false im ages to be real. The dozens and dozens of tim es I have seen people m isunderstand a Generated im age as real
photography is terrifying and upsetting.
