General Comment
AI and, indeed, all electronic system s require reliable and secure power system s. We should harden our electrical grid against potential
dam age from  severe solar weather events, EMP or asteroid im pact, foreign interference, flooding, wildfire, and other severe weather that
could dam age or destroy our power infrastructure. Such efforts would not only ensure we have the the energy to run AI system s, but also
that com m erce and public safety would also be protected. Best wishes for great success in these efforts.
