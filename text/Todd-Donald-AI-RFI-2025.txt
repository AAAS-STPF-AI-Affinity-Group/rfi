The most obvious problem with AI is its "language model training". Which is based heavily on 
that which was digitized or created within the past 30 years. Unfortunately, AI cannot discern 
fact from fiction nor does it have any sense of what real history is . This is especially concerning 
because for many topics it simply regurgitates what it attempts to identify as culturally 
acceptable norms and accepted truth's based on popularity weighting regardless of sources. 
Considering the past 30 years of digital da ta they're using to train it is slanted in the direction of 
the social engineering progressive left, including theories, opinions, academia, and so on. 
Additionally, AI cannot and does not return accurate answers based on ONLY that which is 
evident. The pr oblem is that it's a cool tool, but it SHOULD only weigh its results first on that 
which we KNOW, then what we THINK not the other way around.
