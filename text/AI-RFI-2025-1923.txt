General Comment
AI should not be trained on content that doesn't belong to the individual/com pany/etc that is training it. This is theft and a disregard for the
work m any others have put into their own projects and words. If AI is allowed to train on content that is copyrighted or does not explicitly
belong to the individual/com pany/etc in charge of the AI, then the line between what belongs to who as well as privacy and ownership will
be blurred.
