General Comment
The AI industry is based on a technology that is unreliable, deceitful, and built upon colossal, widespread copyright infringem ent. It is
reaching a plateu at which further investm ent will be a waste of m oney with nothing to show for it. It has proven increase inequity, and
elim inate jobs. The com panies m ust be held to the sam e standards and regulations as any others, and should NOT be granted special
privilege.
