General Comment
As a freelance digital artist, m y career is put at risk by the the ram pant use of artificial intelligence. Corporations continue to choose AI
instead of hiring an artist, and that is the goal of the creator of these AI m odels. They want to replace us, replace real hum an creativity and
passion to save m ore pennies by the year's end.
Not to m ention, the use of other artist's and HEAVILY copyrighted m aterials that m ost artists would get in trouble for using com m ercially
are just paraded around as if they own it.
Not to m ention the am ount of REAL people that are within these m odels, with the advent of even video AI, photographic and even video
evidence in courts would be able to be put into question. It's going to be a scary world if this isn't addressed.
