General Comment
As a writer and creative person, I do not support OpenAI and other AI firm s determ ination to ignore copyrighted work in order to train
their LLMs.
They get upset when other com panies scrape their code in order to build com peting LLMs. Well, that's how we feel when people like
Sam  Altm an want to steal our work to build his com pany. He wants to profit off of our work without com pensating us for that work.
If we aren't allowed to steal another writer's work--if I cannot sim ply publish a book called "The Stand" about a plague and never m ind
that Stephen King person--then they should not be able to steal our work.
