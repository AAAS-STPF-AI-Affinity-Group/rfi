General Comment
Strict guidelines m ust be m aintained for the integrity and authenticity of any “AI” product. The repeal of the safe guidelines enacted by the
Biden adm inistration is a horrendous m istake, and in the opposite direction we need to head to m aintain an ethical application of “AI.”
“AI” m ust NOT be trained on social m edia. 
Com panies developing “AI” m ust abide by copyright laws. The works of artists, authors, m usicians, and all in the field of art and creation
m ust be upheld and not abused. Com panies in violation - by training “AI” m odels on any piece of work that they have not legally
obtained, purchased rights to, or have been given consent to use, m ust be punished and fined for breaking those laws of protection.
If we abuse our artistic fellows, we will only eradicate their drive to create.
We m ust be conscientious, com passionate, respectful, and honest. Any “AI” trained in or with other m anners or intentions will only be
corrupted with poor data.
