General Comment
Giving com panies with LLMs blanket perm ission to bypass all copyrights is an incredibly bad idea. This is exactly the sort of thing
copyrights were created to protect writers and artists against. If OpenAI etc want m ore data, they should pay the writers and artists who
create it, not steal it from  them .
