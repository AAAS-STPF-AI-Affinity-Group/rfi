General Comment
No AI system  is granted the rights to any copywritten content. Using som eone else's content for profit is theft - if this holds true for
corporations against individuals (as -they- often get to dictate!), then it MUST hold true in reverse with no exceptions. Corporations and
the federal governm ent cannot use use others' content without rights as that is theft.
Because all AI system s are trained on content, unless rights are given, those AI system s are theft. A federal departm ent for AI should not
exist under these circum stances as it would be unlawful.
Moreover, large AI system s consum e too m any resources and can only *interpret* what they are given - there are better *and m ore
accurate* uses for our national resources.
As a citizen of this nation, I hereby dem and that this AI initiative be cancelled and dism issed with no further action and developm ent.
