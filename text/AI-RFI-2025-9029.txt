General Comment
Giving anyone outright access to another's work without recom pense or asking perm ission is theft. There are no two ways about it.
Allowing AI owned by anyone to rape the field of hum an-created work dim inishes any hum an that has ever strived to create. There is no
benefit to the creators of m usic, visual art, literature or any other kind of work. This includes m ost of the hum ans living in this country.
Allowing AI to digest the creations of hard working, struggling people devalues hum an life itself. There is no reason such a bill should ever
be considered, let alone passed.
