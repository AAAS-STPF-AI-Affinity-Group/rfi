General Comment
As I'm  sure there has already been an abundance of com m ents pointing out how allowing generative AI com panies effectively m akes a
m ockery of copyright law and the working artists that those laws were m eant to protect, I won't reiterate them  here. I doubt they'll be
listened to.
However I also want to com m ent; Generative AI has already, and will continue to, erode trust in governm ent institutions. If GenAI
com panies are allowed to openly flout the law and steal from  the average citizen in service of a m achine seem ingly purpose-built to churn
out m ass disinform ation, why would anyone continue to trust the governm ent has their interests and well-being as a priority? Further, this
disinform ation m achine could be used to stoke increasingly severe actions, such as hate crim es, m ass shootings, or even acts of terror.
We're already seeing m assive rises in infectious disease due to disinform ation leading people to believe vaccines are ineffective and
dangerous, what happens when Generative AI is used to sim ulate a public address from  a politician that encourages crim inal acts? 
This is technology that has already proven harm ful. There's no stuffing that toothpaste back in the tube, but regulation could prevent a
bigger m ess from  being form ed, and I am  of the opinion that GenAI com panies cannot be trusted to do so.
