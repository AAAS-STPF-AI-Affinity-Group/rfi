It is not right for AI com panies to take copyrighted work to train their AI system s on without any com pensation to the copyright holder
ESPECIALLY when they use these AI system s for profit. This underm ines the copyright holderâ€™s ability to profit from  their work, and
especially hurts sm all business.
