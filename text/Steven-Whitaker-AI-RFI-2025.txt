I understand the concerns external threats, e.g. China, and their lack of interest in maintaining
intellectual property rights. But it is highly unfair and unjust that not 10 years ago, we machinelearning researchers would label our data as publicly available or under intellectual propertyfor use in machine learning or artificial intelligence.
Please, it needs to be understood that machine learning researchers were always wary of
copyright laws and avoiding using copyrighted data in an effort to avoid copyright claims.Yet, now, this is seemingly no longer true and a profit-driven company is allowed to ripcopyrighted data and hide this under the guise of a glossy and unknowing term, "thealgorithm", which is meaningless.
For a concrete example, when an artificial intelligence algorithm is trained on confidential
data, that neural network and its weights are then considered confidential. Yet, in the eyes ofthis Plan, when an artificial intelligence algorithm is trained on copyrighted data, that neuralnetwork and its weights have removed the copyrighted data. This seems very unfair to me.
