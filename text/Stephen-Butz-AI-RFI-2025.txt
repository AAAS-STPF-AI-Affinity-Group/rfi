I know we have some of the most intelligent brains on this planet working on these projects. Please, 
don't try to play God. As intelligent as we are, I know there's no possible way we can fully 
understand what the AI we've created is actually "thinking". I 'm sure it's probably already too far 
past doing so; please have a kill switch. Even it means destroying the power grid. I'm aware what we 
can see, is at least 50yrs behind anything we actually have. It's just the AI you've created; also have 
control of sa id technology. Keep us (the American citizen) in mind please.
