General Comment
Artificial Intelligence and anything like it should be required to have a license and consent from  all m an m ade data sources it pulls from .
Anything m ade from  it should disclose its sources and state what it was m ade with. Artists and creatives deserve to be com pensated and
not be treated as free training data while m aking them selves obsolete.
