General Comment
AI com panies should be held to the rules of the land and not receive special treatm ent for harm ing Am ericans and their works. AI is
unnecessary for the future of US interests. AI has been m ade into a perverse, m orally corrupt m achine exclusively for the sake of profit at
any cost, built upon the broken and ruined backs of countless hum ans. Its will only be used to exploit hum an effort and cut as m any
corners as possible at the expense of the entire world
