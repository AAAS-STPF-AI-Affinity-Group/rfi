General Comment
The Artificial Intelligence Action Plan's only value is to take away what those that create and give it to powers to use for their own
purposes without restriction or com pensation. It will destroy what little ownership people have to their ideas and even identities. Copyright
has taken the form  it has for a reason and allowing those that could easily pay the tithe to ignore it and take what they want anyway is
unacceptable. Hum an innovation this claim s to be helping generate is nonexistent and will only do the opposite. This should not be allowed
to be given a stage or standing.
