General Comment
I am  against this change as it would fundam entally com prom ise Am erican's ability to express them selves in the m arket for fear of devaluing
work by low-effort Ai scrapping. This would hurt not only Am erican workers but also our position to defend our work from  use abroad
by less reputable parties. This lapse in policy would ultim ately weaken Am erican IP and should be stopped im m ediately.
