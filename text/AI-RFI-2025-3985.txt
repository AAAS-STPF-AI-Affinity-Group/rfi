General Comment
The U.S. governm ent should not be working with com panies like OpenAI or others that do not protect or com pensate content creators or
recognize the prim ary sources for the inform ation they aggregate. Citizens, consum ers and creators m ust be protected from  com panies
that want to profit off of the work of hum ans. AI can be a powerful tool if it com es with protections and proper com pensation for hum an
labor as well as safety and ethical controls. Closed LLM system s with proper privacy controls are the preferred option to explore. Our
national AI policy should not favor large corporate interests over that of We the People.
