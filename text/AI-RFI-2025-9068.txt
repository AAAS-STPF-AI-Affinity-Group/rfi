General Comment
This will weaken copyright protections for all artists and writers, both independent and for corporations. Why is stealing intellectual
property okay when running it through m achine learning that can copy parts wholesale versus an individual stealing it? Once an exception
is m ade for one com pany, others will also ask for exem ption and it will be im possible for individuals to protect their work to keep their
livelihoods. People deserve to be com pensated for their work. Com panies should pay for data instead of profiting off of stealing the data.
