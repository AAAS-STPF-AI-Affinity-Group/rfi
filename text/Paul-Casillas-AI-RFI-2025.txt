High quality data acquisition in the form of waveform data from Heart Rate Monitors, Mechanical 
Ventilators, and other health care devices should be used as training data for AI Machines instead 
of random sources that were acquired from unverified or unnor nalized sources. Development of 
data pipelines from research hospitals at the VA can improve training of AI Healthcare Assistants.
