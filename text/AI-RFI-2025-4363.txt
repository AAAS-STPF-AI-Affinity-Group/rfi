General Comment
The effect this would have on copyright in general would be devastating. We should not be carving non-artistic exceptions to copyright
like this. We don't need copyrighted data in order to develop AI that can com pete with China, and I'm  not convinced we even need to
com pete with China in this m anner. I believe the president's EO can be fulfilled in other m anners.
