General Comment
Having the ability to copy anyone's work regardless of who they are or how they created it (except for ai itself of course) needs to have
consequences, having som eone with the power to copy som eone's work to any percentage should not be allowed in any way shape or
form , that is plain theft which is against the law, it being digital shouldn't m atter and it hasn't for years, changing the plans of ai to allow this
will have unforeseen consequences that could alter hum an history no other way than negatively! Please revoke this bill and bar it from
entering circulation again, this is com ing from  an artist m yself, do not allow this bill to proceed, it will ruin artists lives for the foreseeable
future, ruining lives of work and talent for people who couldn't be bothered to m ake the art them selves, its unfair, unjust and plain crooked
as far as m ost of us real artists are concerned!
