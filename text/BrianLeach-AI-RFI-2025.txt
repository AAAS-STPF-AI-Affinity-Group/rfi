This plan should not be implemented.AI is a threat to civil society and on top of that you SHOULD NOT BE STEALING OTHER
REAL PEOPLE'S HARD WORK
Copyright exists to protect creatorsDo not steal from creators
 
AI cannot create original material as it just recycles and mutilates existing works  
If you want to "train" AI then pay others for their blood sweat and tears  
But again, this Administration shows that just like the president himself, it'll lie cheat steal and
refuse to pay others for their work
