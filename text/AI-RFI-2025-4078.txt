General Comment
If I wanted to learn to drive, but I did not have a car, am  I allowed to steal som eone else's car in order to further m y goal? Of course I am
not. It is illegal. Stealing other people's intellectual property is also illegal, regardless of how Sam  Altm an feels about that.
If OpenAI and other sim ilar ventures cannot successfully operate within the law, they should not operate.
