General Comment
This is an outrage. There is no reason on earth that AI should have unlim ited non-consensual access to peoples' likeness, voice, work,
creative products. We are hum an beings. AI is a technological tool built to enhance our lives. This is a violation of the intention of
copyright law, of intellectual property, and of hum an decency! We do not support us and we do not condone this.
