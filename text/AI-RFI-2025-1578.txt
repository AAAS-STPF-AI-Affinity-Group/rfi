General Comment
There is no world where violating the intellectual property and copyright of Am erican citizens so that tech com panies can turn around and
charge for that sam e artistic output is okay. If fair use is applied to “train” AI on copyrighted work, all AI output should be free of charge
forever. 
The copyright and artistic integrity of Am ericans, the international standard for artistic output and protections, m ust be protected at all
costs.
