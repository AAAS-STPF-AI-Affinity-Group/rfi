General Comment
AI does not need to be general AI for it to be dangerous. We already have m assive learning program s that can effectively addict and
ensnare hum ans for hours or days. Current AI can produce em otions and m edia that are ‘better than the real thing,’ and it will only get
m ore and m ore powerful. Without regulation, our people will wear out their lives in front of their com puter screens, expiring alone in front
of that glow, fully convinced to their las breath that this was the best, m ost rewarding possible use of their lives.
