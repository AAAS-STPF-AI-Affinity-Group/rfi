General Comment
I do not believe this will be good for Am ericans, or anyone anywhere if it were to expand. AI m ade be a helpful tool for m inute actions,
but not on a scale being presented. It would threaten jobs m ore than create jobs, especially those within the creative fields who already
struggle with unfair wages and work conditions.
I ask you do not go through with this.
