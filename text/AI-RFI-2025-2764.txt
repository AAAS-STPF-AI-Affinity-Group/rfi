General Comment
Artificial intelligence should not be allowed to use any copyrighted m aterial as training data. When a person uses m aterial for training, they
are not allowed to profit off the training m aterial. AI is using the training m aterial in order to m ake profit while using the copyrighted
m aterials without any significant change that would qualify as fair use. If AI wishes to use copyrighted m aterials, they should need to
license that m aterial, including paym ent if that is what the copyright holder wishes.
