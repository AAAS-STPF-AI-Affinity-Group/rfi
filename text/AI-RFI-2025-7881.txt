General Comment
If citizens have no rights over their intellectual properties or data, then labor has no value, which would be a series of consequences that
could easily collapse our entire society. If you want AI to develop properly, then m ake actual conditions and accom m odations for it
happening, rather than just doing whatever talking head says would be good.
