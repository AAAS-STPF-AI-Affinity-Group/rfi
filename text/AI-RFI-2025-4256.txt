General Comment
I do not believe that AI has a place in the governm ent. It is a fickle technology that is prone to m istakes and can be used as an excuse to
prevent accountability. If an AI m akes an error - let's say with som ething like a drone strike and it hits innocent people and not targets,
who is held accountable? A hum an did not sign off on the decision, an AI did, so who takes the blam e? Im portant decisions like this m ust
be m ade by m en and not zeros and ones.
In addition to this, it is absolutely laughable that OpenAI thinks that them  being able to steal from  coyprighted works is a m atter of national
security. It is not national security that they be able to freely steal the IP of different com panies and artists so that they can train their AI
m odels, disenfranchising those two groups in the process. I am  an artist. I get m y livelihood by drawing and illustrating. My own work is at
risk with these m odels even existing. By allowing them  to get past copyright with no repercussions, will not only harm  m any different
com panies, but will also harm  m illions of workers like m e. AI profits off of theft. Its m odels cannot exist without stealing the work of
hum ans. A product that cannot exist without being crim inal, should NOT exist. If OpenAI cannot exist without stealing, then it should
NOT exist.
