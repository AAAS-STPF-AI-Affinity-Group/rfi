General Comment
The federal governm ent should not develop any “plan” concerning “AI” other than a plan to shut it down. 
AI for the m ost part produces slop. Being pro-AI is supporting the death of the hum an spirit and the rise of slop. 
No one whose m orality is form ed correctly supports that. 
Make a plan to shut down AI.
