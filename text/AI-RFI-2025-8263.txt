General Comment
The AI bubble is going to burst soon, and I don’t see how generative AI m eaningfully im proves lives. My experience with AI at m y work
in academ ic publishing is as a disinform ation m achine that clogs up the works and m akes things harder for publishers and authors.
It is a predictive rem ixer and will never be able to differentiate between truth and untruth.
I have yet to see proof that it im proves language or im ages. I have yet to see proof that it can m ake things m ore equitable for people. It is
an entertaining parlor trick, but I am  unim pressed with all the outputs I’ve encountered.
People talk about it like it will save lives (and flying cars are 5 years away), but it can’t even save tim e. It has already wasted tens of hours
of m y tim e, which is essentially lost m oney for m y em ployer.
Do not give away the rights of people who actually create to enrich those at the top of a Ponzi schem e. There’s plenty of slop on the
internet; we need to support real creators, not the AI m oney pit.
