General Comment
What is being considered by this court is a disgrace. A com pany that cannot sustain its own technology WITHOUT being exem pt from
laws protecting individuals is not worth being funded. Any idiot can claim  he can create a profitable and sustainable m odel if he could just
ignore law and com m on hum an decency. Should we allow com panies to pay their workers NOTHING as less wages would surely m ean
that the com pany will be m ore profitable and powerful? If we allow this blatant theft and abuse of personal data and copyrighted works,
we are allowing businesses to have m ore power and privilege over people, a m ove that will destroy jobs and destabilize an already
stressed econom y. This is a disgrace.
