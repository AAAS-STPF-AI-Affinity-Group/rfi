General Comment
What we are referring to here as a.i. is not a.i.. It is not a m assive innovation that could change the future. It is a m eans to steal the hard
work of creators via an easy to deny algorithm  which m agically m ake theft legal. Not only should the governm ent not support this, it
should support efforts to dism antle the rapidly expanding ring of thieves and support the creative writers, artists, film m akers, and actors
who have m ade the USA the dom inant force in entertainm ent for the last century. If we do not cap this now, there will be no wrangling it.
And nothing produced under this m odel will be distinct or original. We stand to lose the thing that m ost m akes us, us - our innovation and
creativity - in the nam e of a short term  easy buck.
