General Comment
If AI technology only has a CHANCE to succeed by stripping the rights of Am erican citizens and their copyright protections, than it has
no place in the future of Am erican's business. As an Am erican consum er and taxpayer, I should not have to worry about theft at such a
scale that could leave m yself and m y fam ily financially doom ed. If our governm ent cares about its people it should recognize that this can
ONLY harm  the m illions who supply food and shelter to their fam ilies through their safely copywritten work.
