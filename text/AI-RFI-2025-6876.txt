General Comment
AI as tech com panies are attem pting to push into and take over aspects of public hum an life is dam aging to everything I as an Am erican
hold dear. It is bad for the environm ent and it is bad for artists whose work it steals. There is no future in generative AI, save it for
correctly identifying cancerous cells. Generative AI has no place in our nations future, it is nothing m ore than a scam .
