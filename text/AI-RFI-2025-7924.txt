General Comment
If AI is allowed to run ram pant without lim itation, credentials for any sort of m edia and real footage will never be able to be fully trusted.
Without regulation, AI will be used by and large for m isinfo, defam ation, and harassm ent. For every positive use of OpenAI's
developm ents, you can find a negative or harm ful one. 
Generative AI in its current existence hasn't been around long enough to justify attem pts to becom e a "world leader" in its developm ent.
On som e level there's an artificial hype behind it that hasn't shown enough benefits to be worth focusing on in the governm ent when there's
m uch m ore urgent things that could be prioritized and funded.
