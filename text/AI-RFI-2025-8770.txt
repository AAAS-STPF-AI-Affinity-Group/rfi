General Comment
AI harm s actual artists and writers by stealing from  them . These corps say content m akers work is not worth anything, but their system s
can't function without it which tells m e that THEY SHOULD REALLY PAY FOR THEM! Either artists work is valueless and the AI
shouldn't be trained on it, or it's needed and they should pay a pretty god dam n penny for it.
