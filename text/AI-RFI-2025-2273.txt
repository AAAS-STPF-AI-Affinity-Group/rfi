General Comment
Generative AI is copyright infringem ent. It is clear without strict regulations it will continue to be used unchecked and will be a detrim ent to
those who cannot afford prolonged copyright infringem ent lawsuits.
This clearly favors large com panies with legal team s and throws all individuals under the bus, som e who rely on their work as their sole
incom e.
In education it is clear that generative AI is also kneecapping students ability to develop critical thinking as they begin to rely heavily on
generative writing tools. In the long run this will stifle innovation and lead to the US falling behind in education, including but not lim ited to
science and health fields.
In the use of AI in potential m ilitary applications, I struggle to think of a scenario where there is not enorm ous negative ethical im plications.
I do not think we should be attem pting to utilize this. I think it is only valuable to have a defense for it from  other nations.
In general, AI rem oves the hum an capacity to think of the m oral and ethical consequences. In things like sorting large quantities of
aggregate data I’m  sure it’s useful. In others, it is theft.
