General Comment
The plan in question (The AI Action Plan) is not going to help the protection of copyright if you listen to OpenAI, Google, and Ai
developers. They want total protection over their illegal scraping of copyrighted m aterials. And that would discourage the developm ent of
the new arts. Because, if we know that AI com panies would scrape it, why should we? Please do not go along with the action plan in
order to please the AI developm ent corporations. Please respect the Berne Convention.
