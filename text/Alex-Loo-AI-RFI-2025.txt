Hello,  
reducing roadblocks to AI is a mistake. AI is not a benefit to national security and,
in fact, is an active detriment to both national security as well as to the Americanpeople. This aggressive push to make it easier for AI tech companies to takeadvantage of American citizens is nothing more than a greedy ploy to make a smallfew rich off of the suffering and exploitation of the masses. This plan is shamefuland predatory.
 
Do NOT  remove copyright protections so AI companies can steal from private
citizens. It is theft, plain and simple. I do not want this, the American people donot want this, and neither should the government. AI is inaccurate in ways thatfundamentally cannot be fixed, it is inhuman, and it is actively harmful toeveryone.
 
We, as a people, claim to value hard work and effort, but AI does not championeither. It steals the hard work of others so that tech leaders can make more moneyoff of doing increasingly little work. Stop it now.
