General Comment
Generative AI is nothing m ore than theft. To give OpenAI a shield from  legal action would cause an absolute breakdown in copyright law
and all of its related fields. Since it is obvious that nobody cares about the poorly-paid artists who actually do the work that AI steals
from , perhaps it would be a good idea to rem ind you what lies in the chasm  at the bottom  of the slippery precipice you find yourselves
perched atop: if you give AI the ability to openly steal from  other artists and creatives, then you should also allow the IPs of the corporate
m edia giants to becom e fair use. But we all know you donâ€™t want that. PROTECT ARTISTS, NOT THIEVES.
