General Comment
AI cannot be granted free access to copyrighted m aterial. Generative AI is going to ham per innovation, growth, and stability in so m any
sectors. These tech com panies need to pay for the foundation if they want to continue to develop their product. Stop letting these tech
bros run our country. Elected leaders need to stand up to AIâ€™s theft of inform ation. Reject this proposal!!!!
