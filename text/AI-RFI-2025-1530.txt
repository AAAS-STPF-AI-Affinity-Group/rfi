General Comment
AI in creative fields is going to destroy hum an creativity. Personal creative works are im portant for the hum an experience. AI output is not
what we should be prioritizing in illustration, writing, voice acting, anim ation, or any like creative fields. Such practices need to be
disincentivized for the sake of creatives and consum ers alike. The loss of arts and hum an m ade craft will be the largest loss of hum anity we
can im agine. Cave paintings were m ade by hands, not hy m achine. And that is precisely why we m arvel at their creation to this day.
Hum ans have always created art and we need to be able to do so in the future. The present is preserved by the interpretation of artists
living today.
