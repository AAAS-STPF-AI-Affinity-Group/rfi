General Comment
I do not believe AI has a place in the future of our country. AI technology will continue to strip jobs from  creative workers and m em bers
of scientific fields alike, and the m assive detrim ent to our environm ent is not worth the false perception of national dom inance that the
president aim s for. We m ust be pioneers in environm ental protection and hum anity, not a shortsighted technology that undercuts the value
of the Am erican people and their work.
