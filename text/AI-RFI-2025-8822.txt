General Comment
I strongly disagree with this. Copyright should not be violated and people’s work should not be stolen to train generative AI m odels. An
artist’s work is their own. The use of AI to create capital based on stolen skill (while depriving skilled workers of the ability to earn
capital) is unethical.
