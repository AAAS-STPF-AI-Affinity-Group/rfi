2. Introduction: Systems Engineering as the Foundation for AI
Leadership
Executive Order 14179 establishes a clear mandate to “sustain and enhance America’s global
AI dominance” by removing barriers to innovation while promoting economic competitive-
ness and national security. Achieving this objective requires a paradigm shift in how we
conceptualize and implement AI advancement—moving from isolated component optimiza-
tion to integrated systems engineering, particularly as AI systems evolve toward increasingly
agentic capabilities.
The historical evolution of AI reveals a critical inflection point in modern approaches. Early
successes like IBM’s Deep Blue demonstrated remarkable capabilities in narrow domains but
lacked the flexibility and adaptability required for broader applications. Today’s leading AI
organizations — from DeepMind’s groundbreaking Alpha-Series innovations to DeepSeek’s
demonstration of exceptionally engineered foundation model implementations — have em-
braced systems-level integration that orchestrates multiple AI components into cohesive,
powerful solutions. Moreover, many of the fundamental advances in science and engineering
now combine data-driven and model-drive approaches,
This transformation is especially evident in the rise of agentic AI—systems capable of au-
tonomous goal-setting, planning, and execution across diverse tasks. By 2028, AI agents
2


are projected to be embedded in 33% of enterprise applications, up from less than 1% in
2024, with at least 15% of daily business decisions expected to be made autonomously by
agentic AI. This shift from assistive to autonomous AI systems represents both the greatest
opportunity and challenge for American technological leadership.
The concept of Agentic AI envisioned here goes well beyond the orchestration of large lan-
guage models that combine natural language understanding and tool use; this field will
develop to include planning systems and hierarchical memory and reasoning mechanisms,
both parametric and symbolic, as well as goal-setting, extrospective perception, and multi-
faceted introspective and allocentric theories-of-mind capable of navigating human-centric
dynamics in high-consequence applications. This expansive vision of agentic AI—with ad-
vanced cognitive architectures that can reason across multiple levels of abstraction and adapt
to complex human environments—demands systems engineering approaches that can inte-
grate these diverse capabilities into coherent, reliable, robust, and resilient frameworks with
performance guarantees
Systems engineering principles provide the ideal framework for implementing the vision of
Executive Order 14179 by:
•Accelerating innovation through modular, interoperable components that enable rapid
iteration
•Ensuring reliability and robustness through rigorous verification and validation frame-
works
•Facilitating market-driven development by establishing clear interfaces between com-
ponents
•Enabling objective evaluation of system performance independent of ideological con-
siderations
•Creating technical and economic multiplier effects through orchestrated integration
This systems approach naturally removes barriers to innovation while establishing the techni-
cal foundations necessary for deploying AI at scale across critical domains including defense,
manufacturing, healthcare, energy systems, and education. It embodies the dual imperatives
that must guide the AI Action Plan: developing robust engineering practices for AI system
development (“Engineering for AI”) and leveraging AI capabilities to transform traditional
engineering disciplines (“AI for Engineering”).
3. Leveraging Systems Engineering Principles for Advancing Amer-
ican AI Leadership
Maintaining American leadership in AI requires a bidirectional approach: applying systems
engineering principles to advance AI capabilities (“Engineering for AI”) while simultaneously
3


leveraging AI to transform traditional engineering disciplines (“AI for Engineering”). This
dual focus creates a virtuous cycle of innovation that accelerates progress in both domains.
3.1. Systems Integration for Enhanced Performance and Market Competitive-
ness
The integration of AI components into cohesive systems represents a critical differentiator
for maintaining American technological leadership. Systems integration
•creates performance multipliers by orchestrating complementary AI capabilities;
•enables market differentiation through unique combinations of components;
•establishes competitive barriers through system-level optimization that competitors
cannot easily replicate;
•accelerates innovation by allowing rapid iteration of individual components within
stable system architectures.
Historical precedents from sectors including aerospace, defense, energy systems, supply
chains, and telecommunications demonstrate how systems engineering approaches have con-
sistently enabled American technological leadership. The same principles can be applied
to AI development to extend U.S. advantages against global competitors who are rapidly
advancing component-level capabilities.
Case studies of successful systems integration from both defense and commercial sectors
illustrate how orchestrating multiple technologies creates capabilities greater than the sum
of individual components. University research plays a crucial role in de-risking advanced
integration concepts that can then be commercialized by industry partners.
3.2. Orchestration of AI Components in Complex Systems
Effective orchestration of AI components represents a key technical challenge and opportunity
for American leadership. This includes:
•Integration across human operators, classical code, AI algorithms, and cyber-physical
systems;
•Development of orchestration frameworks that enable complex workflow automation;
•Establishment of objective performance metrics for comprehensive system evaluation;
•Creation of technical and market multiplier effects through seamless component inter-
action.
Modern agentic AI systems must coordinate multiple sophisticated capabilities—including
hierarchical planning, parametric and symbolic reasoning, extrospective perception, and
4


theory-of-mind mechanisms—to solve complex problems in human-centric environments.
These advanced cognitive capabilities require orchestration frameworks that can maintain
coherence across multiple levels of abstraction while ensuring reliable performance in high-
consequence applications. American leadership in developing these orchestration frameworks
would establish a competitive advantage that transcends individual model capabilities.
Organizations implementing agentic AI systems without proper systems engineering frame-
works encounter significant challenges:
•Integration difficulties between multiple AI components;
•Performance bottlenecks that limit overall system capabilities;
•Reliability and robustness issues when deployed in real-world environments;
•Verification and validation challenges for complex, interconnected systems;
•Barriers to scaling from laboratory demonstrations to production environments.
These challenges highlight why systems engineering must serve as the foundation for Ameri-
can AI leadership. Countries and organizations that master systems integration will maintain
competitive advantages even as individual AI components become more widely accessible.
3.3. Emerging AI Engineering Patterns as Strategic Frameworks for Advanced
Agentic Systems
As AI systems mature toward the sophisticated agentic capabilities we envision, distinct en-
gineering patterns have emerged that provide structured approaches to system development.
Six key patterns have particular strategic importance for maintaining American leadership
in developing these advanced AI architectures:
•Models : Frameworks for developing, evaluating, and deploying foundation models
that support both high-fidelity simulations, control and optimization, and symbolic
and parametric reasoning capabilities as building blocks for more complex integrated
AI systems.
•Users: Methodologies for engineering reliable, intuitive interactions between humans
and AI systems with theory-of-mind capabilities that can navigate human-centric dy-
namics while balancing autonomy with appropriate oversight.
•Context: Techniques for grounding AI capabilities in relevant domain knowledge
through approaches like hierarchical memory structures, advanced knowledge retrieval
systems, and fundamental physical, chemical, and biological laws.
•Orchestration: Architectures for coordinating multiple cognitive functions including
planning, perception, reasoning, goal-setting, control, and optimization that collabo-
rate to solve complex problems through specialized, complementary capabilities.
•Evals & Observability : Frameworks for continuous assessment and improvement
of multi-level AI systems through rigorous testing and monitoring across different ab-
straction layers.
5


•Mindset: Organizational practices and engineering culture that maximize effective-
ness in developing AI systems with introspective and allocentric reasoning capabilities.
These patterns provide structured approaches to challenges that all advanced AI systems
must address. By establishing leadership in these patterns, the United States can create
reusable frameworks that accelerate innovation while ensuring reliability across diverse ap-
plications. The mindset of modularity inherent in these patterns enables market-driven
innovation while maintaining system-level integration capabilities.
3.4. AI Lifecycle Management (AIOps) as Competitive Advantages
The operational infrastructure for developing, deploying, and maintaining AI systems rep-
resents a critical enabler for rapid innovation:
•Extend MLOps concepts to an AIOps framework that streamline the transition from
research to production through standardized processes;
•Lifecycle management ensures consistent performance through continuous monitoring
and improvement, self-healing, self-tuning, and adaptation to new environments;
•Model governance frameworks maintain technical quality and reliability throughout
system development and deployment
•Integration of DevSecOps principles ensures security and reliability in national security
applications
Current global competition in AI is not merely about model capabilities but increasingly
about the infrastructure that enables rapid iteration, deployment, and continuous improve-
ment and adaptation. U.S. leadership in AIOps frameworks would create a sustainable
competitive advantage in AI system development and deployment velocity.
4. Strategic Recommendations for the AI Action Plan
4.1. Research Priorities that Enable Market-Driven AI Leadership
To maintain American AI leadership, we recommend prioritizing research investments in
both “Engineering for AI” and “AI for Engineering”:
4.1.1 Engineering for AI:
•Systems-level integration frameworks that accelerate the composition of advanced agen-
tic capabilities including hierarchical planning, symbolic reasoning, control, optimiza-
6


tion, and theory-of-mind mechanisms;
•Verification, validation, and testing methodologies for complex AI systems with mul-
tiple cognitive functions operating across different levels of abstraction;
•Interoperability standards that enable competition while facilitating the integration of
diverse AI components including perception, reasoning, and planning systems;
•Performance guarantees for agentic AI systems operating in safety-critical domains
with human-centric dynamics;
•Cognitive architectures that support allocentric reasoning and adaptive goal-setting in
complex environments;
•Energy-efficient computing paradigms for supporting sophisticated AI cognition at
scale.
4.1.2 AI for Engineering:
Establishing U.S. leadership in AI will necessitate an integration of AI tools in every engi-
neering disciplines from supply chains and manufacturing, to energy production and trans-
mission, healthcare, material design, semiconductor design and implementation. This will
require
•AI-driven tools that accelerate traditional engineering processes across disciplines, by
bringing orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency.
•Frameworks for integrating AI capabilities into existing engineering workflows, inte-
grating domain-inspired AI systems.
•AI systems that enhance human engineering capabilities rather than replacing them,
including in design, monitoring, and optimization.
•Methodologies for addressing engineering challenges that were previously intractable,
through the combination of data- and model-driven approaches.
•Simulations and digital twins, and their surrogate models, that enable rapid exploration
of design spaces
Universities represent ideal and unique environments for high-risk, exploratory research needed
to develop novel integration approaches and foundational systems engineering frameworks.
By focusing federal investments on these system-level capabilities, the AI Action Plan can
establish enduring American advantages that are difficult for competitors to replicate.
We recommend establishing a national research initiative focused specifically on systems
engineering for agentic AI, with coordinated funding across NSF, DARPA, DOE, and other
federal agencies. This initiative should emphasize market-driven approaches that preserve
competition while establishing frameworks that accelerate commercialization.

4.2. Workforce Development and Educational Transformation
Maintaining AI leadership requires addressing the complementary challenges of developing
”Workforce-ready AI” systems designed to integrate seamlessly with human workers and
creating an ”AI-ready Workforce” capable of effectively implementing and working alongside
advanced AI systems:
•Workforce-ready AI: Developing AI systems that augment human capabilities, align
with existing workflows, and create intuitive interfaces for non-technical users - enabling
workers to achieve greater productivity and innovation that strengthens America’s
competitive edge.
•AI-ready Workforce: Building human capacity through educational programs that
prepare workers at all levels to effectively implement, work alongside, and maximize
the potential of AI systems - creating economic opportunities while enhancing national
technological capabilities.
Addressing these dual challenges requires strategic approaches to workforce development:
4.2.1 Paradigm Shift in Education for AI Systems Engineering
Developing an AI-ready workforce requires a fundamental reconceptualization of technical
education from single-degree attainment to lifelong learning cycles. Georgia Tech Profes-
sional Education (GTPE) provides a model for continuous upskilling aligned with rapidly
evolving AI capabilities.
This educational transformation must address a number of key paradigm shifts:
•From training narrow AI tool specialists to developing systems specialists capable of
orchestrating complex AI-enabled workflows.
•From siloed technical skills to cross-domain mastery integrating computer science, cog-
nitive science, engineering, and ethics.
•From theoretical foundations alone to balanced curricula that integrate practice, im-
plementation, and real-world problem-solving.
•From isolated technical skills to interdisciplinary understanding that bridges domains
like computer science, cognitive science, engineering, and ethics.
•From static curricula to adaptive learning pathways that maintain American compet-
itive advantage amid rapid AI advancement
•From traditional assessment methods to competency-based evaluation focused on sys-
tem integration capabilities.
Georgia Tech’s AI education initiatives incorporate experiential learning environments that
simulate the complex challenges of real-world AI system integration. These environments
8


provide students with hands-on experience orchestrating multiple AI components to solve
problems across domains from healthcare to manufacturing to defense applications. Georgia
Tech is also a national leader in high-school AI education and the training faculty across the
country to create novel AI programs. Both components are key to the future of AI in the
U.S., attracting talent early on and training the educators needed to sustain the workforce
demands.
4.2.2 Developing Workforce-Ready AI Systems
The complementary challenge to building an AI-ready workforce is creating AI systems that
are designed from the ground up to integrate effectively with human workers. Workforce-
ready AI systems should:
•Provide intuitive interfaces that empower users to easily adopt and leverage AI capa-
bilities;
•Augment human capabilities to amplify productivity, creativity, and innovation, rather
than simply automating existing processes;
•Seamlessly integrate with and adapt to organizational workflows to enhance efficiency
and effectiveness
•Offer appropriate explanations of AI-driven decisions to build trust with human oper-
ators;
•Enable progressive levels of autonomy that evolve as organizational readiness increases.
Georgia Tech’s research in human-AI collaboration and interactive machine learning provides
frameworks for developing AI systems that work effectively alongside humans with varying
technical backgrounds and domain expertise.
We recommend establishing a national program that incentivizes the development of workforce-
ready AI systems through targeted research funding, public-private partnerships, and edu-
cational initiatives that bridge technical and domain-specific training.
4.3. Computing Infrastructure and Technical Standards
Next-generation AI capabilities require corresponding advances in computing infrastructure
for commercial and national security resilience:
•Low-power and low-latency computing innovations enabling AI at the edge;
•Distributed computing networks that manage dynamic mission-critical resource allo-
cation, from commercial robotics to tactical edge environments;
•Energy-efficient architectures that create both economic and strategic advantages;
9


•Technical standards for interoperability that enable component-level competition;
•Secure computing environments for high-consequence AI applications.
University-industry partnerships play a crucial role in accelerating commercialization of com-
puting innovations that enable advanced AI capabilities. Technical standards should focus
on interfaces and interoperability rather than implementation details to preserve market
dynamics.
We recommend investments in next-generation computing infrastructure specifically opti-
mized for agentic AI systems, with particular emphasis on:
•Energy-efficient architectures that reduce computational overhead;
•Edge computing capabilities that enable real-time AI processing;
•Communications infrastructure that facilitates distributed AI systems;
•Standards frameworks that ensure interoperability across vendors;
•hardware architectures and accelerators that support the integration of data-driven AI
with reasoning, optimization, and scientific computing.
4.4. AI for Scientific Discovery and Workflow Transformation
AI systems are fundamentally transforming scientific discovery and engineering workflows
across disciplines by enabling data-driven approaches that complement traditional theoretical
and experimental methods:
•Systems engineering principles provide frameworks for reimagining scientific and engi-
neering workflows to leverage AI capabilities (“AI for Engineering”);
•AI-driven scientific discovery pipelines accelerate innovation in fields from materials
science to drug development;
•Enhanced capabilities for abstraction and modeling of complex phenomena through
AI-augmented approaches transform conventional engineering disciplines;
•Integration of domain-specific scientific tools with general-purpose AI capabilities cre-
ates powerful new research methodologies;
•Traditional engineering fields like energy systems and supply chain engineering benefit
particularly from data structure-aware AI applications.
The economic multiplier effects of accelerated scientific discovery represent a critical dimen-
sion of national competitiveness. By establishing leadership in AI-driven scientific workflows,
the United States can accelerate breakthrough innovations across sectors ranging from ad-
vanced materials to pharmaceutical development to climate science. Systems engineering
approaches are essential for integrating AI capabilities into scientific workflows while pre-
serving methodological rigor and ensuring reproducibility.

American AI leadership.
6. Conclusion
A comprehensive AI Action Plan must champion both “AI for Engineering” and “Engineer-
ing for AI”—recognizing that maintaining American leadership requires not only advancing
AI capabilities through robust engineering practices but also leveraging AI to transform
11


traditional engineering disciplines. This bidirectional approach creates a virtuous cycle of
innovation that accelerates progress across domains.
The emergence of sophisticated agentic AI systems—with advanced planning capabilities,
hierarchical memory, symbolic and parametric reasoning mechanisms, and multi-faceted
theories-of-mind—represents both the most significant opportunity and the most profound
challenge for American technological leadership. These systems will transcend today’s lan-
guage models to become adaptable cognitive architectures capable of navigating complex
human-centric environments in high-consequence domains. By embracing systems engineer-
ing principles as the foundation for advancing these sophisticated AI capabilities, the United
States can establish sustainable competitive advantages in developing agentic systems that
perform increasingly autonomous functions while maintaining reliability, robustness, and
alignment with human objectives.
Georgia Tech stands ready to support the development and implementation of this plan
through our research capabilities, educational programs, and industry partnerships. By
adopting systems engineering principles as the foundation for AI advancement, the United
States can establish sustainable competitive advantages that fulfill the vision of Executive
Order 14179 to “sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance.”
