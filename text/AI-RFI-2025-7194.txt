General Comment
Copyright exists to protect the works of true creators. The push for AI to access this inform ation shows how worthless of a product
generative AI is. If AI is as great as it is constantly advertised then it wouldn't need to be im m une to copyright protections.
Protect the works of creators, do not let AI com panies profit off of others.
