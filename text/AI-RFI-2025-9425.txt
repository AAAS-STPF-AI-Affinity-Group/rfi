General Comment
This is insane to think that you can give som eone Carter Blanche to steal other peopleâ€™s work.
LLM and genAI are useless toys that only the ignorant and uniform ed think are useful. They are dangerous, worthless and are a drain on
our natural resources.
Open burn pits of m oney is m ore entertaining and useful than anything LLMs or genAI has m ade.
Though I know you are all corrupt and will do it anyway. You cowards.
