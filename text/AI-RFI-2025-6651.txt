General Comment
Allowing AI to train on copyrighted m aterial is theft, it is stealing from  the livelihood of citizens while enriching those holding the reins.
AI in this respect is an attem pt to m onetize the works of other citizens without providing them  com pensation, legal action to fight against
the free use of their works, or a choice in what their intellectual property is used for. This is theft.
