General Comment
Dear, Governm ent
No... Just no.
I do not want whatever AI crap is going on with these tim es at all, and least of all for it to be codified in law. Listen to the artists who are
affected by it, the people who m ake life worth living here by the entertainm ent and artistic talent they bring. Don't just allow it to be
gobbled up by the AI m achine that is spreading like a virus. So just... no.
Sincerely, a concerned citizen
