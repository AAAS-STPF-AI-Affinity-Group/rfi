General Comment
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proven to provide not only false inform ation but used to create plagiarized works of art, videos,
m usic, and writing. It is a tool used only to steal the works of others without providing proper source or credit or to create false claim s
and fake data for things that are otherwise incorrect. It is a dangerous tool and should have its use discouraged or banned outright due to
the nature of how it requires the com panies using it to acquire data and inform ation from  others without their knowledge or consent.
Furtherm ore it has been used to create deepfake im ages of real people in various situations, som e of which are explicit as a way to harass
or potentially harm  the subject. AI takes away from  real Am erican jobs and m akes a m ess for those it has not yet replaced due to how
incorrect the data it provides is. Generative AI needs to be regulated or stopped all together for the sake of the Am erican people and all
peoples around the world.
