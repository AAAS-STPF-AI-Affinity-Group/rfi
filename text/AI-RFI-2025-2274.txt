General Comment
I do not believe AI has any place in the future of the United States' or the world's success. If we are to be concerned about the am ount of
m oney being spent by the US governm ent on inefficient or wasteful ventures, then it would be prudent to avoid investing in AI. It is
extrem ely expensive, proven to be ineffective at accom plishing its very sim ple goals, and a m uch sm aller am ount of m oney could be spent
on som ething m ore im m ediately beneficial to everyone's lives--such as infrastructure.
