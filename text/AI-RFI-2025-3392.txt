General Comment
This "burdensom e" governm ent regulation was clear copyright protection for creatives, academ ia, and other parties from  having their
efforts stolen and reused without perm ission. This large scale language m odels do nothing m ore steal the work from  these parties and then
reproduce a "close enough" approxim ation. And the fact that ethical treatm ent of those who actual produce the work that these m odels
train of of is considered burdensom e should be given pause and thought. I am  100% against the rem oval of these protection.
