General Comment
Copyright laws exist for a reason, to protect people from  predatory and illicit crim inals from  stealing works from  people and profiting off
of it. No exem ptions, no m atter who or what for, should be m ade to just give people or com puters, access to works owned by som eone. 
We've already seen how abusive and out of control AI can get. How it has been m isused m ore than it's intended purpose of helping
people. It's an abusive technology that actually isn't even AI, but a string of com parisons to hopefully, m aybe, say the right thing. It actually
doesn't even think. 
And ask yourselves this; Do we really want any m ore videos of Donald Trum p sucking on Elon Musk's toes? Do we need to see m ore
pictures of Donald Trum p sucking on Elon Musk's toes circulating the internet on Google, Bing, any search engine on the internet? Do we
want to see books m ade by AI on Am azon, Barns and Nobles, or any bookstore selling m ultiple versions or sequels of Donald Trum p
sucking on Elon Musk's toes? Do we want to hear an AI generated voice of both Donald Trum p and Elon Musk reading the book aloud
for anyone to hear, of them  discussing and going through how badly Donald Trum p wants to suck on Elon Musk's toes?
Because what's to stop them  at toes?
With AI having access to all those copyrighted works, it can get far worse with just the click of a button. 
So NO to AI having access to copyrighted works!
