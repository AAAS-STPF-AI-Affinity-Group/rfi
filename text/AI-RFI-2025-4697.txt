General Comment
The idea around providing protections to groups like OpenAI is based in the idea that Am erica's future lies with the further developm ent
of generative AI and LLMs. The problem  is that there is no such future there. The system s these groups tout as the next step in creative
output can only subsist through theft and general disregard for the work of artists, writers, voice actors, and m ore who work to provide
not only for them selves but for those they share their work with.
In this context, artificial intelligence has only been used as a tool to further agendas that go past being anti-Am erican to be outright anti-
hum an. Fake videos of innocent people spouting ideas they don't believe in, iconic im ageries repurposed for propaganda, jobs left by the
wayside in favor of an inferior product. No one stands to benefit from  this in the short or long term , we only have m ore people to hurt by
providing protections to AI com panies.
Do right by the people you're supposed to stand for, stop this plan from  going through.
