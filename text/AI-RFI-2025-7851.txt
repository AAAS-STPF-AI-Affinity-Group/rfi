General Comment
Com panies and individuals in the US enjoy robust intellectual property (IP) protection under copyright law. IP protection encourages
incentivises innovation by ensuring that innovators can enjoy the benefits of having created their IP, be those first m over advantages, or, in
the case of creative works, in the sale of licenses to use their work.
Any plan to develop artificial intelligence (AI) regulation m ust respect existing copyright law when incorporating IP into training data.
Generative AI can be thought of as a com petitor to those producing creative works by m ore traditional m eans. Failing to enforce
copyright law does them  m aterial harm  through the loss of license fees and disincentivises innovative creative work.
Discouraging the production of new original creative work by traditional m eans will also hurt the developm ent of AI in the long run. There
have been studies that show that AI m odels experience "m odel collapse" when too m uch AI-generated content is incorporated into their
training set, which m eans new training data m ust be created by IP owners. Rem oving the basic IP protections already set out in US law
will reduce the am ount of new content available for training in the long run, ham stringing future innovation.
