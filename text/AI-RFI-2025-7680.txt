General Comment
I do not believe AI holds a place in the future of the US. AI steals from  m y livelihood as an Am erican anrtist and profits off of theft. AI is
overhyped and is fleecing the eyes of the Am erican public. We should be prioritizing creating jobs for real people and stop these grifters
from  stealing from  countless artists and Am ericans. If you allow these com panyâ€™s to profit off our hard work you are cowards and history
will not rem em ber you kindly.
