General Comment
Copyright is a cornerstone of intellectual property law. Scrapping copyright protections for tech com panies building large language and
im age generation m odels creates conditions where certain specific tech com panies are given an unfair com petitive advantage in the
m arketplace. Generative m achine learning m odels create direct com petitors to existing products out of those very sam e products.
Additionally, generative m odels can be used to directly reproduce copyrighted m aterials in their datasets. Artificial intelligence m ust be
forced to obey the sam e copyright protections every other entity in Am erica is bound by.
