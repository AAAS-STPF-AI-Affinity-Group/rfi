General Comment
AI guidance should be directed to shape the legality of source training m aterials. IP protection and copyright our im portant statues in our
country, and allowing them  to be ignored and copied by a large com pany or under the guise of AI is a senseless abuse of privilege by
these com panies.
If they can figure out how to design an AI neural network, they can figure out how to stop abusing copyright. 
Do not allow com panies to operate above the law.
