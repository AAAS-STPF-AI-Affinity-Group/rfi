General Comment
OpenAI has no benefit to Am ericans and is only ever used to steal from  hard working people who are struggling enough as it is. Anything
that it "creates" is soulless and absolutely awful in term s of quality and m orality and should not be given a free pass to continue to steal as it
has been.
