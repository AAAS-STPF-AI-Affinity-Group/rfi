General Comment
The fact that copyright protection is being labelled as "unnecessary burdensom e requirem ents" is absolutely sham eful and reprehensible.
The precedent that this sets is irreparably harm ful to the protection of creative works and intellectual property, insinuating that anyone who
claim s to be training an AI m odel can sim ply access any m aterial they want and profit off of it without license or royalty. If this is to be
allowed, then what stops anyone from  using the pretense of training an AI m odel to access copyrighted m aterial for free with no
consequence? In fact, why should any copyright protections exist at all if such a gaping exception is going to be m ade? This request spits
in the face of all creatives, or indeed anyone who has produced work that could be used in this training. It tells them  that their work does
not deserve any protection, that any leech off the street should be able to profit off of work that doesn't belong to them . It tells them  that
they are disposable, and they do not have a place in society.
