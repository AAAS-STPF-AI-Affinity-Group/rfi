General Comment
If we're going to blatantly ignore copyright law for the purpose of advancing a technology it CANNOT be for the benefit of private
corporations. Any LLM that is trained using indiscrim inate data m ust only be as a part of a public works project. The training data should
be disclosed, the m odel and it's weights should be open, and the training m ethods and source code m ust be open source. If the people are
contributing their work (in the form  of their data) then this technology needs to belong to the people.
Reject any plan that benefits individual corporations over the Am erican people.
