General Comment
As an artist, this initiative needs to be reconsidered. All m ajor AI providers have used stolen artwork, photography, m usic, video, and
basically any other form  of m edia to power their m achines, with no recourse for the m illions of people affected.
Not only that, but these m odels will put creatives out of work in favor of products that are just inferior to those with a hum an touch.
The worst thing about this plan, however, is the potential for m isinform ation and disinform ation. With the im provem ent of the technology,
m edia that intentionally m isleads people is being created en m asse, such as fake historical footage. This doesn't even factor in AI's use for
m ore nefarious purposes like in the cases of revenge porn. 
All in all, please reconsider the position on AI.
