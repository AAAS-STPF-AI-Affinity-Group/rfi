General Comment
AI such as OpenAI profit off of theft, and steals from  hardworking, talented individuals. The servers used for these generative AIs
consum e m assive am ounts of energy and dum ps tons of toxins into our atm osphere. It would be ill-advised to support these ventures with
the possible security risk they could pose to the Am erican public as well. Please, do not allow generative AI to take root in our country.
