Why is the ability to rip off my intellectual property necessary  to ensure that unnecessarily
burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation?
This is, once again, stacking the deck so the tech oligarchs can make money off the backs of
people doing creative work. This has absolutely nothing to do with national security. If youwant to train AI (and contribute to excessive environmental destruction along the way), hireand pay people to create the input necessary for that training. Giving private companiesleeway to steal my intellectual property is unconstitutional.
