General Comment
Generative AI, especially with respect to creative pursuits, does not generate value. It generates soulless slop. It is a waste of
environm ental resources. It cannot progress past a certain stage of developm ent without infringing upon copyright holdersâ€™ intellectual
properties. AI is a waste of resources and should NOT be developed further.
