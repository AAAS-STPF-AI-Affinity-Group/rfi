General Comment
I believe if this is allowed to progress then am erica loses its m ost valuable export, entertainm ent. You are allowing AI datasets to m inim ize
the vast resources of Am erican m ade, cultural copy written works of art into literal worthlessness for no tangible benefit to anyone outside
of the com panies running AIs developm ent. What did they do to earn the privilege to take our countries collective history of art, m usic,
m ovies, TV and gam es for their own benefit? They’re not invested in the expansion of Am erica as the leading cultural destination of the
world. Their products would only reduce all of what we m ake for the rest of the world into m iddling, m ilquetoast drivel. It’s awful, gross,
corrupt and frankly, it stinks! And, I don’t like it!
