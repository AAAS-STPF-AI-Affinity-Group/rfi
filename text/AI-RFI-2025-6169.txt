General Comment
AI should not be allowed to use others' work to create anything for com m ercial use, whether it's art, anim ation, writing, or anything in
between. Art is som ething that it unique to the user who m ade it, and an AI taking it and passing it off as its own is wrong. So please,
don't let this action plan go forward.
