General Comment
AI has been proven to cost vast sum s of m oney m ore than it is generating for any country, com pany, or individual, not to m ention the
insane toll it is taking on our energy consum ption. Every piece of work scraped by AI is owned by an individual, com pany, or otherwise.
There is no ethical or m oral grounds to allow AI free reign on Copyright m aterial. Do you think Disney will stand for their m ascots to be
used in any way an AI generator feels like? What about Walm art having their likeness or m aterials used in the sam e m anner? What about
when used for nefarious reasons? Or perhaps prom otional m aterial of a politician used for illegal content generation? Will you allow AI
com panies to begin creating, finding, and distributing Child Sex Acts m aterial? Because that's what this will cause. Nothing an AI com pany
wants to happen is for the benefit of anyone but the person who owns the nam e to be free from  all repercussions their com pany does. We
m ust hom e these people accountable for the theft they willingly, knowingly, and fervently pursue.
