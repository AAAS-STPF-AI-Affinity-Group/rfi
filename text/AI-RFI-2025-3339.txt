General Comment
AI is doom ed to fail. Its harm ful to our governm ent, our industries, and its em ployees. It has not turned a single profit in years and hopes
to m ake that m oney by fleecing, stealing, and robbing the Am erican people blind. 
It destroys our environm ent, requires power that is unsustainable even if we som ehow m anaged to retroactively m ine fossil fuels we've
already used (im possible). AI isn't AI. It generates keywords that a good google search already does for cheaper environm ental im pact. 
It harm s our celebrities. It harm s our working class. It harm s everybody. Its a literal version of a thousand m onkeys with infinite
typewriters and tim e. And all it produces is softcore pornography for those unable to get a girlfriend. 
Let this generative slop die like the m arket dem ands instead of propping up a failed system  at the expense of REAL HARD WORKING
AMERICANS!
