General Comment
Enabling AI in the way that is being put forward here would m ake it im possible to put forward creative projects of any kind without
subm itting to total theft of those creative projects on the basis of, 'AI cannot function without m ass plagiarism ', which in its current shape it
cannot.
This would effectively end any reason for United States copyright law to ever be respected internationally, and set all non-AI-centered
industries against AI-centered industries.
This is a great decision if you, for instance, wanted to end U.S. cultural dom inance for som e reason. But it's a pretty bad decision if you
don't want to dim inish U.S. cultural authority.
