General Comment
I wonder what percentage of the voter base allowing the people who are pushing this legislation to stay in office actually wants not just all
hum an creative endeavors but all aspects of life be overtaken by AI. Anything that eases the way for these inhum an corporations to
suppress genuine artistic integrity through the facsim ile that is AI is a betrayal of not just "Am erican" values, but hum an ones as well. The
fact that this plan is allowed to even be proposed when it m akes 99% of people's lives objectively worse while protecting the purely
greed-driven interests of the 1% is despicable, but I suppose not entirely surprising for this country. Be prepared, and enjoy the abject
cruelty of your "victories" while they last.
