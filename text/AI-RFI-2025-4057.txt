General Comment
Generative AI takes away the livelihood of m yself and m any of m y fellow Am ericans.
Most im portantly, and this is for every sector - not just creative: AI HAS NO REASON TO IMPROVE ITSELF, BE ACCURATE, OR
CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I cannot stress this enough. It is a parrot that seeks to fill in what it has been told are logical blanks,
not search for inaccuracies or be responsible for quality. A HUMAN worker has MOTIVATION to do well, be correct, and can be held
accountable when things go belly up.
I m ake a living providing audio design and voice work for m any brands, giving their presence hum an em pathy when people sit through ads
or have a phone service guiding them  as they have to navigate difficult life events. Generative AI cannot and will never be able to do this. I
also have a REASON to do well at m y job: I have pride for m y craft and reputation, yes, but incidentally also need to eat and pay rent. I
can also be held accountable when m y work is incorrect or sloppy. You cannot sue or point fingers at ChatGPT's AI as its creators throw
up your hands in befuddlem ent when som eone's child com m its suicide over its responses. This is the future you're perm itting if you don't
work on a just and firm  action plan where AI is not allowed as such an unregulated tool - ESPECIALLY in the m ost vulnerable sectors of
our lives like the creation of specifically hum an experiences and ideas.
