General Comment
AI has no place in art, especially when it cannot be regulated as it steals and is built on the backs of actual artists. Having ones livelihood
stolen to train a m achine that is designed to take career opportunities is not only abhorrent but both im m oral and unethical. AI com panies
m ake m illions off of the unpaid labor of artists they've never spoken to, m erely fed their work into an algorithm  and then reaped the
rewards of. This will have devastating consequences, and lead to a generation of lost artists who no longer pursue their passion due to the
knowledge a m achine will always be chosen in favor of cost cutting m easures over talent and hard work.
