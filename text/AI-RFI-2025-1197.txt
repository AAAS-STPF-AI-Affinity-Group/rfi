General Comment
My nam e is Cassidy Johncour, and I am  a 2nd-sem ester senior at Avonworth High School. I studied generative AI and its im pact on
theology for two m onths in a course on AI and Ethics this year. From  m y research, I think this current adm inistration's viewpoint on AI
regulation is risky. Taking down barriers and lowering regulations to have U.S. dom inance in AI m ay not be beneficial. AI infiltrates m ore
of our country every day, and reducing regulations will only increase its dom inance over us, not the other way around. What I m ean by
this is not AI itself controlling us but others who wrongfully use it. Som etim es, people don’t even know the dam age they can cause,
especially through the loss of jobs. AI has entered every aspect of people’s lives, including their faith. A particular but worrisom e hum an
replacem ent was Pepper the robot, taking the role of a hum an priest. Pepper has spoken at funerals and at crowds. Another consideration
would be writers; they are no longer a necessity. Alexandra Kirsch works for Salesforce and was a guest speaker in m y AI and Ethics
course. She is a writer for the com pany and stated that she felt as if she were “training her replacem ent” when exposed to AI. She tries to
refrain from  the use of artificial intelligence because it lessens her creativity in her writing, although she said she is certain AI will take her
job one day. Conclusively, I disagree with the adm inistration's current viewpoint on AI regulation.
