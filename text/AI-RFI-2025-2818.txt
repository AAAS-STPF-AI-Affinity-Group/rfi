General Comment
Generative AI com panies, such as OpenAI, spend billions of dollars to lose billions of dollars on products that do nothing m ore than
waste all of said m oney. There is no reason to give them  any protections other than to continue the farce that is the declining AI m arket
that will continue decline, and giving them  any protection will harm  consum ers, artists, creatives, and anyone whose work was stolen by
these com panies to profit off of them . Not only that, any federal m oney spent on these com panies will go down the sam e drain that any
investors (i.e. Softbank) have put into these com panies, which could aptly be described as nothing m ore than m oney pits, losing m ore
m oney than any m arket seen before.
