General Comment
This is blatant copyright infringem ent â€” the law states that you cannot use copyrighted works for profit. AI is for profit. If AI can use
copyrighted works to m ake m oney, does that m ean everyone can use copyrighted works to m ake m oney now? The answer is no, yes? If
so, seem s a bit unfair and tilted to benefit only one party here.
