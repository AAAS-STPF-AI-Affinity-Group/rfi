General Comment
If I pick out words to string together, bother to subm it the words in order for people to read, and som eone publishes these words of m ine,
I want the right to the copy. It was m y idea and I expressed it. I did not pick out words to teach a com puter program  what is clever. I
can’t own individual words but I can own the order. Keep autom ation out of m y cleverness. Com puters will never understand why it’s
clever anyway.
Why not use com puters to police plagiarism , because plagiarism  is ram pant, and it’s still a crim e. Plagiarism  is stealing. Don’t m ake
com puter plagiarism  legal. Don’t steal work. If you want m e to say it 100 ways I can, but I won’t, because that’s what you think is better:
100 m ore ways of saying the sam e thing, num bly generated into awkward garbage. Com puter generated content is m aking the world
worse.
Preserve and protect hum an generated work.
