General Comment
AI causes harm  to the Am erican people: 
Environm ental harm , because the data centers behind generative AI require a ridiculous am ount of energy and water— Energy and water
priced out of the hands of US citizens. 
Econom ical harm , because of the jobs it’s taking away from  Am erican workers in the creative sector.
Intellectual harm , because the widespread use and influence of chatGPT has been catastrophically detrim ental to the developing m inds of
students in our education system . Not to m ention the inaccurate hallucinatory inform ation it provides in search engines, m aking previously
reliable tools like google practically useless.
AI without regulation is harm ful to this country.
