1.Introduc tion
THE GLOBAL AI LEADERSHIP IMPERATIVE  
As America enters a new era, the rapid evolution of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) presents both an 
unprecedented opportunity and a mounting governance gap. Novel AI capabilities —ranging from generative systems 
that create human -like content to AI agents that will operate with increasing autonomously —are advancing at 
breakneck speed, outpacing the regulations and risk frameworks needed to guide their secure use. This dilemma is 
especially profound in regulated sectors such as government  and healthcare where clarity on deploy ing transformative 
technologies is urgently needed to accelerate adoption . We currently lack cohesive policies and tools to keep pace with 
AI’s trajectory, leaving the country vulnerable to misuse, uncertainty, and strategic disadvantage. Allowing adversarial 
states  that d o not share our values to take the lead presents far -reaching risks.  Addressing these challenges and 
proactively shap ing the evolution of AI  will help this administration to  bridg e the governance gap and ensur e a secure 
and prosperous American -led future.

ISSUE  
Despite AI’s potential to enhance healthcare delivery and patient care, the high cost of AI and integration challenges 
remain the most  significant barriers to adoption.  Healthcare leaders identified  the expense of AI development and 
deployment as a top obstacle, with many hospitals and health systems finding it difficult to invest in AI technology due 
to limited budgets and unclear return on investment. This financial barrier slows innovation and can widen the gap 
between well -funded institutions and resource -limited ones, since only organizations with substantial capital can afford 
to experiment with cutting -edge AI tools.  Additionally, integration with existing systems  and complex  clinical workflows  
presents a major challenge , as many healthcare IT infrastructures —particularly legacy electronic health record (EHR) 
systems —are not designed to accommodate AI outputs or data streams seamlessly.  As a result,  even promising AI 
solutions fail  to progress beyond pilots, as clinicians face disruptions from their workflows and have difficulty juggling 
multiple software systems . Without addressing these significant barriers, AI’s potential to transform healthcare will 
remain largely untapped.
