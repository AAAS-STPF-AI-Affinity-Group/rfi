I am writing to express my strong support for an AI policy aimed at ensuring proper
compensation and opt-in approval for artists, writers, and other creative professionals. In therapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, it is vital that creators' rights are protected,and this policy represents a much-needed step in the right direction.
As AI technologies continue to advance, many artists and writers are increasingly concerned
about their work being used without their explicit consent or fair compensation. This policywould provide the necessary framework to safeguard their intellectual property and ensurethey are adequately rewarded for the value they bring to the creative industries.
By implementing a system where creators can opt in and receive proper compensation for the
use of their work in AI systems, we would not only foster innovation but also ensure that thecontributions of artists and writers are respected and valued. This is crucial for sustaining thecreative economy and encouraging a future where both technology and the arts can thrivetogether.
Thank you for your leadership on this issue. I wholeheartedly support the efforts to establish a
fair and equitable system for AI in the creative fields and look forward to seeing this policyimplemented.
