General Comment
Generative ai m odels m ust appropriately com pensate all those whose m aterials they use for training. Those m ust also opt into the m odel's
use. There m ust be swift and punitive dam ages for every single infraction as if it were the piracy incident that it is. 
If these m odels can not afford to pay creators to use their m aterials, sadly they aren't efficient enough to exist.
