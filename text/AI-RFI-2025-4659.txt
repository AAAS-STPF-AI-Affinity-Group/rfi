General Comment
As far as AI training goes, there is absolutely no need to have access to the works of people who depend on that work for their livelihood
and/or the progression of the com panies they work for. Anything they would need for training is already available in the Public Dom ain.
It's an im m ense am ount of data and m aterial that could fuel the developm ent of any AI training system . With so m uch inform ation already
available, it stands to dem onstrate they sim ply want access to m aterial and inform ation of the Am erican people to aid their prim ary form s
of business aside from  AI training. And they want it for free at the expense of the governm ent and the Am erican people. Doing this will
only hurt the US econom y at a tim e where it's already a fragile thing. We need to build up m ore jobs to strength the nation, but this sort of
AI training will only take jobs away. Let them  train their system s on public dom ain m aterial, it's already open to them  and won't cost
Am erica anything to just leave it at that new works and data are entered into the Public Dom ain every day, it's ever expanding. There just
aren't any good reasons to give access to the work of Am erican's and the work of com panies that together power our econom y. Please
do not let this happen.
