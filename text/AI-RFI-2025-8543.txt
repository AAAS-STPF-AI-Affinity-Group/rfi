General Comment
I am  an artist who is very m uch angry about AI com panies stealing m y work. These com panies should be prosecuted to the fullest extent
of the law for copyright infringem ent, and should not be allowed to keep doing what they are doing. This is m ass theft, plain and sim ple. If
I stole docum ents from  m illions of Am ericans, I would be rightfully convicted of theft; why should we not do the sam e for AI?
