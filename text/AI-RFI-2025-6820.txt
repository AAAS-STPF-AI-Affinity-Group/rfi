General Comment
AI is largely seen as useless, incom petent and m alicious. There are legitim ate reasons for this view. AI has been devised by m any
corporate actors to deny citizens and consum ers their right to due process by hum ans or by a com petent authority. AI does not replace
that authority. 
If AI continues (som e people appreciate it for its ability to synthesize a broad range of sources) robust protections for citizens and
consum ers m ust be present, in addition to citizensâ€™ right to independent appeal (not by AI) and overturn and decisions m ade by AI.
